## Coal Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Andrew P. Schissler, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004 3.13 Industrial Engineering. Underground coal mining, as in any producing enterprise, requires an infusion of industrial engineering to maximize safety and productivity.Coal mine design practice has shown that safety and productivity are mutually inclusive goals. Underground mining methods are a mix of continuous and batch processes.

This continuous miner is ideal for operations that require high cutting force, such as coal mines, potash mines, salt mines, and room mines. The unit's makers use modern technology to make the operations efficient and accurate.. The design of the MC470 makes it ideal for harsh mining conditions where it can work perfectly even on restricted spaces.

## Coal Miners - West Virginia
Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production. In continuous mining, a machine known as a continuous miner cuts the coal from the mining face, obviating the need for drilling and blasting. Another type of continuous underground mining is called longwall mining.

During the late 1940s, conventional techniques began to be replaced by single machines, known as continuous miners, that broke off the coal from the seam and transferred it back to the haulage system. The Joy Ripper (1948) was the first continuous miner applicable to the room-and-pillar method. Origins of longwall mining

## Best practices for dust control in coal mines - GRT
The largest source of inhalable and respirable dust at continuous mining operations are generated from two sources which are the continuous mining machine and the roof bolter. The continuous miner and the roof bolter operators are often exposed to elevated silica levels because of cutting and drilling into the rock.

## Continuous Miners For Cutting Coal & Soft Materials | Sandvik
Sandvik double-pass miners use the most advanced cutting technology for the continuous mining of coal and soft materials. Continuous miners cut and gather the material simultaneously and convey it into shuttle cars, haul trucks or a continuous haulage system. They are typically used for full-scale production in room-and-pillar mining operations.

## What Do Continuous Miner Operators Do (including Their Typical Day At Work)
Continuous Miner Operators operate self-propelled mining machines that rip coal, metal and nonmetal ores, rock, stone, or sand from the mine face and load it onto conveyors or into shuttle cars in a continuous operation. They also hang ventilation tubing and ventilation curtains to ensure that the mining face area is kept properly ventilated.
