## Engineered Quartz - The Stone Collection
Quartz is an engineered, manufactured, man-made product. This is achieved by using a combination of the elements above (quartz, resin, pigment). Quartz is often confused with quartzite, which is a 100% natural stone that comes from deep within the Earth at a stone quarry. A Quartz slab doesn't come from a stone quarry; it is created in a factory.
