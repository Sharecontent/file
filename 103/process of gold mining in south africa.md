Mineshafts and mullock heaps are an extremely common sight throughout the bushland of the goldfields. You will regularly come across abandoned mine tunnels, discarded boilers, machinery site foundations, remains of gold puddling machines (or puddlers), and cyanide vats. The 19th century gold mines which once dominated the region now lie abandoned.

The current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors. First, the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession; second, the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations; and third, the structural character of our mining industry.
