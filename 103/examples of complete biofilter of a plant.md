## Biofilter
A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called biofilm. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed-film process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms ( bacteria, fungi, yeast, etc.), macro-organisms ( protozoa, worms, insect's larvae, etc

The biofilter is a component of an aquaponics system that contains bio media which increases the surface area for beneficial bacteria to thrive.

## Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor: Aquaponic Biofilter - Flourishing Plants
A Moving Bed Bio Reactor should be built such that it is a separate component attached to the aquaponic system. The piping should be arranged such that the incoming stream from the mechanical filter directs the flowing fluid downwards into the biofilter. All piping should be connected using uniseals or bulkheads.
