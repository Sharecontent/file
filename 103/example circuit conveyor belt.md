## Conveyor Belt controller - Engineers Garage
Conveyor Belt Controller Circuit Connections & Operation. Connections: - as shown in circuit tab 1 two ports of 89C2051 P1 & P3 controls entire system. Pins P1.0, P1.1, P1.2 are connected to fwd, stop and drop controls through buffers 7407. P1.5, P1.6 & P1.7 drives 3 LEDs as shown. So P1 is completely output port.
