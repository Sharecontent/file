## Rock Salt and Sea from Pakistan, Himalayan salt High Quality at Low Price
Rock Salt Mining is the process of extracting sodium chloride from underground salt deposits using mechanical methods. These underground salt deposits, sometimes referred to as dried-up, ancient seabeds, can reach depths of 1,200 meter and span for thousands of acres. These salt basins were formed after undergoing millions of years of

Rock salt is the name of a sedimentary rock that consists almost entirely of halite, a mineral composed of sodium chloride, NaCl. It forms where large volumes of sea water or salty lake water evaporate from an arid-climate basin -- where there is a replenishing flow of salt water and a restricted input of other water.

## White Salt Production | How to Make Table Salt | Salt Association
The table salt in your saltshaker and the salt used in food production is the end product of a two-step process of extraction and refinement - called Solution Mining and Brine Evaporation. Solution Mining. In solution mining, salt is extracted by forcing water under pressure into a bore-hole drilled into an underground salt bed or dome.
