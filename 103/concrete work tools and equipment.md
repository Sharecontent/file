## The 14 tools needed to build a concrete slab
Here is the list of tools you need to place the concrete: Concrete screed or straightedge. A bull float - for smoothing the concrete. Kumalong or concrete rake - for pulling and pushing the concrete in place. Mag float - for smoothing the edges. Concrete boots - I know, not really a tool but you need them.
