## Natural Recovery of an Abandoned Limestone Quarry: Soil  - USDA
Limestone is an important raw material that is widely used for multiple agricultural and industrial purposes (Pamukcu, and Simsir, 2006). Rapid economic development and the growth of urban areas in many countries have increased need for limestone which, in turn, created many abandoned quarrying sites in urban areas offering unique challenges to urban agency managers such as foresters, and

Thymus is a genus of aromatic perennial plants that are native to Europe, North Africa and Asia. A total of 70 honey samples from hives situated on limestone (38 samples) or gypsum soils (32 samples) were studied. The physical and chemical properties of each samples were analyzed using standard assays.

## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcite, a calcium carbonate mineral with a chemical composition of CaCO 3. It usually forms in clear, calm, warm, shallow marine waters. Limestone is usually a biological sedimentary rock, forming from the accumulation of shell, coral, algal, fecal, and other organic debris.

An advantage in the limestone soils is that the soil properties, including soil texture and soil pH, contribute to SOM accumulation. Thus, maintaining SOM storage is key to solve the soil erosion problem in the CC, such as agricultural abandonment, reducing tillage, and application of organic fertilizer.
