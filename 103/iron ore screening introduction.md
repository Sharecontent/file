A total of 6 parallel lines process 9500 t/h of ore. Screening equipment is installed after the primary crusher, after the scrubber and after the tertiary comminution stage to separate the iron ore into a dry coarse fraction (8 - 40 mm) and a wet fine fraction (> 1 - < 8 mm). The fraction < 1 mm passes through another washing stage.

## Study on Failure Characteristics of Stemming Structure on Iron Ore 
Blasting tests on iron ore specimens with different stemming structures were carried out to quantify the internal fracture and damage characteristics of the specimens by means of computed tomography (CT) scanning, digital image processing and three-dimensional (3D) model reconstruction techniques. The results showed that the blasting load produced radial and circumferential cracks in the iron
