Portland and Bath stone generally exhibit compressive strengths of between 30 and 50MPa (megaPascals), which is similar to good quality concrete and more than sufficient for most purposes. Limestone is typically impressively strong under compression, like concrete, but exhibits flexural strengths of around one tenth of the compressive strength.
