3 days agoExample for concrete calculator in Yards, Here, I want to show you a calculation for a 20' by 20' and 3'' thickness concrete slab. 1 . 20×20 = 400 square feet. 2 . 3/12 = 0.25 feet. 3 . 400x 0.25 = 100 cubic feet. 4 . 100 x 0.037 = 3.7 cubic yards. The above example is solving for volume in yards.
