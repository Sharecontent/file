## Wafer backgrinding
Wafer backgrinding is a semiconductor device fabrication step during which wafer thickness is reduced to allow stacking and high-density packaging of integrated circuits (IC).. ICs are produced on semiconductor wafers that undergo a multitude of processing steps. The silicon wafers predominantly used today have diameters of 200 and 300 mm. They are roughly 750 μm thick to ensure a minimum of

After the silicon wafer is cut into several pieces, each piece is rotary ground to a final shape. This step is essential for smoothing out rough edges, which result from slicing the silicon wafer. This step is called secondary grinding. In this process, the silicon wafer is ground along its edge diameter, reducing the amount of waste.

## DEA1 - Wafer grinding process - Google Patents
A wafer grinding method comprises a center grinding step of grinding a central portion of a wafer by using a plurality of grinding members arranged in a circle to thereby form a circular ring, thereby forming a circular recess at the central portion of the wafer and at the same time a circular projection around the circular recess a height storing step for detecting a height of a grinding unit
