## Properties of Stones | Requirements of Good Building Stones - CivilJungle
Strength is an important property to be looked into before selecting stone as a building block. Indian standard code recommends, a minimum crushing strength of 3.5 N/mm 2 for any building block. Table 1 shows the crushing strength of various stones. Due to the non-uniformity of the material, usually, a factor of safety of 10 is used to find the

The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length.
