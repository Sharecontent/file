Our Building Sand is screened to ensure it is of the highest quality and does not contain any impurities such as larger stones. The finer the sand is originally, the smoother the resultant mix will be. Our clients require and deserve the highest quality in materials, so we constantly try to improve and revisit existing procedures.
