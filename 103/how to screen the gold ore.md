To reclaim 500 grams of gold, you would need to disassemble more than 1.1 tons of circuit boards. This does provide a simpler way to obtain gold than mining it. Mining 1.1 tons of gold ore results in two to three grams of gold. With respect to other precious metals, you can also obtain the metals more easily by reclaiming them from within a TV.

To crush the gold ore in order to obtain pure gold, the large ore of gold is fed into a jaw crusher or mobile jaw crusher for the primary crushing process. The crushing process acts as a medium of screening the fine gold ore. It is then sieved using the vibrating screen and later sent through the use of a conveyer belt.

Gold Ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft, typically found in veins of 1 to 9, from y=0 to y=31 in all biomes, and in veins of one to nine from y=28 to y=80 within a badlands biome. The ore itself is dropped when mined with an iron pickaxe or better. It has little use in tools and armor, since the durability is very low. Gold Ore can be smelted in a (blast) furnace to make gold ingots

## Gold Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Gold Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is to make Gold Bars, which can be used to make the Gold tier of equipment, as well as crowns, Thrones, and several other items. The equivalent of Gold Ore is Platinum Ore, which will sometimes replace Gold in a world. Gold Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes.

## How you can Leach Gold Ore With Chlorination
Ensure that the liquid mixture is at least six times the volume of the ore grains. Wear a face mask and avoid breathing the chlorine fumes the reaction produces. Pour the acid-and-bleach mixture into the plastic bowl with the ore grains and stir. Allow four hours for the gold to dissolve, stirring every 20 minutes.

## How you can Test for Gold Ore - Geology | ScienceBriefss
To test a rock for gold, first perform nondestructive visual inspections and tests for weight and magnetism. You can also use destructive methods such as testing hardness, streak, ductility, or pulverizing and panning the powder. You will need a scale, glass, unglazed ceramic, and a powerful magnet.
