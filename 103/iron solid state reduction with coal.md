## Creosote
Creosote is a category of carbonaceous chemicals formed by the distillation of various tars and pyrolysis of plant-derived material, such as wood or fossil fuel. They are typically used as preservatives or antiseptics. Some creosote types were used historically as a treatment for components of seagoing and outdoor wood structures to prevent rot (e.g., bridgework and railroad ties, see image).

1. Introduction. The coal-based direct reduction process produces metallic iron from ferric oxide under the solid-state. Normally it is observed that when the reaction temperature is low, the reduction rate will be slow .On the other hand, when the reaction temperature is too high, it is prone to bond and will cause a waste of energy.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## Selective catalytic reduction
The selective catalytic reduction reaction of nitric oxide by ammonia over vanadia-titania catalysts is one of the methods of removing NO x pollution. In the present study, it has been possible to identify the reaction mechanism and the nature of the active sites in these catalysts by combining transient or steady-state in situ (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) experiments directly.
