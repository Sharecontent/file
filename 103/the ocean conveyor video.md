## The Global Conveyor Belt | National Geographic Society
May 20, 2022The Global Conveyor Belt. The global conveyor belt is a system of ocean currents that transport water around the world. While wind primarily propels surface currents, deep currents are driven by differences in water densities in a process called thermohaline circulation. Density depends on both the temperature (thermo) and salinity (haline) of

## Ocean on the Move: Thermohaline Circulation
Deep ocean currents, on the other hand, are mainly a result of density differences. The thermohaline circulation, often referred to as the ocean's "conveyor belt", links major surface and deep water currents in the Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern Oceans. Multiple mechanisms conspire to increase the density of surface waters at high

The ocean breaths through its surface. The oxygen itself comes from the surface of the oceans, where waves and tides mix the oxygen into the water. Even though, this o­nly works for the first 150 to 200 meters (deep) from the surface, while the oceans have an average depth of 3.7 kilometres and a maximum depth of 11 kilometres!

Sep 8, 2022Too much carbon dioxide in the air is a problem, as it causes the Earth to trap more heat. The ocean absorbs about one-quarter of the CO 2 that humans create when we burn fossil fuels (oil, coal, and natural gas). Too much carbon dioxide in the ocean causes a problem called ocean acidification.

The conveyor belt is also a vital component of the global ocean nutrient and carbon dioxide cycles. Warm surface waters are depleted of nutrients and carbon dioxide, but they are enriched again as they travel through the conveyor belt as deep or bottom layers. The base of the world's food chain depends on the cool, nutrient-rich waters that support the growth of algae and seaweed.

## Paleoclimatology: Explaining the Evidence - NASA
The evidence, which they took from radioactive elements in ocean cores, is beginning to support the theory, but McManus cautions that there are still pieces to fill in before we fully understand what role the conveyor belt played in past climate change and what role it might play in the future.

## The Ocean Conveyor - Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
April 11, 2018. Atlantic Ocean Circulation at Weakest Point in More Than 1500 years New research led by University College London (UCL) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) provides evidence that a key cog in the global ocean circulation system hasn't been running at peak strength since the mid-1800s and is currently at its weakest

## The Great Ocean Conveyor | Oceanography - The Oceanography Society
A diagram depicting the ocean's "conveyor belt" has been widely adopted as a logo for the Global Change Research Initiative. This diagram (Fig. 1) first appeared as an illustration in an article about the Younger Dryas event that was published in the November 1987 issue of Natural History.It was designed as a cartoon to help the largely lay readership of this magazine to comprehend one
