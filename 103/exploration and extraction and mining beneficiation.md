## Extracting crude oil and natural gas - Essential Chemical Industry
Hydraulic fracturing (fracking) Conventional natural gas and oil deposits are found in permeable rocks, trapped below impermeable rock. These deposits can be extracted by drilling down through the impermeable rock into the permeable rock. But gas and oil are also trapped in the spaces within impermeable shale rock.

## Key Sectors - Mining and Beneficiation
Mining and mineral beneficiation currently contributes some 5,0% of South Africa's GDP and is the country's single largest private employer (400 000 people), with small-scale mining operations also making a significant contribution to employment creation. Despite the hard times, mining still employs just under 3% of South Africa's employed
