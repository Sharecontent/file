Phosphoric Acid is used to prevent the after effects of groundwater exposure to iron and manganese, better known as "red water" (from iron) and "black water" (from manganese). When iron and manganese are exposed to air, they oxidize and discolor the water. This creates rust stains from the iron, or brownish-black stains from the manganese

During the mixing process, sulphuric acid should be added to water. Reason being that since sulphuric acid is heavier than water it will move to the bottom due to gravity and the mixing will be much uniform. In case we add water to sulphuric acid, since the water is lighter than sulphuric acid, it will stay at the top.

Phosphoric acid, also known as orthophosphoric acid, is a triprotic acid that exists as a dense liquid. It is an irritant or corrosive to the skin, eyes, and other mucous membranes of both humans and laboratory animals. Its salts, though, exhibit a significantly lower irritancy potential. Moderate toxicity has been observed in mice when exposed
