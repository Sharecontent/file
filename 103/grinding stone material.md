## 3D models of Grinding Stones - Museum of Stone Tools
Grinding stones were used to grind and crush different materials including seeds, bulbs, berries, insects, fibres, and ochre. In hand-grinding, the top stone was small enough to fit in the hand, and usually had a convex surface. The bottom stone was usually concave, and the concavity developed as the stone wore away through use.

Silicon carbide is an abrasive used for grinding gray iron, chilled iron, brass, soft bronze and aluminum, as well as stone, rubber and other nonferrous materials. Ceramic aluminum oxide is another major development in abrasives. This is a high-purity grain manufactured in a gel sintering process.

## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.

## What is Dressing and Why Does Your Grinding Wheel Need It? - Okuma
Dressing returns the grinding wheel to its original sharpness by removing old grains to reveal the fresh grain underneath. It removes clogs, dulled abrasive grains, and excess bonding material to help minimize vibration, thereby improving surface finish. Dressing also helps restore the shape of the wheel which changes over time due to wheel wear.

Thursday, August 27, 2015. There seems to be endless methods to care for highly polished stone. One of these endless methods is grinding. There are actually three main methods of grinding: grinding with stone abrasives, diamond, or silicone carbide disk. Each is similar in concept but very different in materials used, results, costs, and time.
