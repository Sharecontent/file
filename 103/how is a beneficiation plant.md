Coal Beneficiation an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The hard coal beneficiation process in mechanical preparation plants generates coarse, small or fines rejects and coal tailings slurries. The tailings are the finest grain size, with the majority below ~ 0.25 mm, whereby material sized below 0.035 mm makes up to 60 share in theposition.

Dense-medium beneficiation of fine (minus 0.5 mm) coal is not a new concept and has been used in South Africa previously. The dense-medium fine coal plant at Greenside Colliery operated for almost 18 years and, despite proving a difficult plant to operate, did succeed in producing a fine coal product with a low ash content of 7%.
