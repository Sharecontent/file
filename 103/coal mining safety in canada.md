Donkin — the only operational underground coal mine in Canada — closed in 2020 after a series of roof cave-ins and a provincial stop-work order put a pause on operations. The ventilation fan that causes Donkin's constant noise pulls fresh air into the mine to dilute methane, which is naturally occurring in coal, and prevent explosions.

A mining accident is an accident that occurs during the process of mining minerals or metals. Thousands of miners die from mining accidents each year, especially from underground coal mining, although accidents also occur in hard rock mining.Coal mining is considered much more hazardous than hard rock mining due to flat-lying rock strata, generally incompetent rock, the presence of methane gas

The largest consumers of coal in Canada are Alberta and Ontario. In 1997, Alberta accounted for 47% of Canada's coal consumption at 26.2 million tonnes, and Ontario accounted for 25% at 13.8 million tonnes. Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick also use coal to generate electricity to varying degrees.
