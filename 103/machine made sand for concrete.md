## Concrete machine-made sand
Three strength grades of concrete C30 C40 and C50 and the contents of stone powder in machine-made sand of 5 9 and 13 in mass were considered in the mix proportion of concrete with machine-made sand. The ordinary concrete with natural river sand in the same strength grade was tested at the same time for comparison.

## The main purpose of machine-made sand
· Sand is a multipurpose topographical material. It is known as one of the three fundamental ingredients in concrete. The composition of sand is diverse. Mostly sand is made of silica which is a common element. It can also come from another source of minerals like quartz limestone or gypsum.

Four researchers named the new substance Finite. It is as strong as concrete and is biodegradable. Wind-swept sand, up until this point, was fairly useless in manufacturing.

The reason concrete cannot be made simply by mixing sand with cement is that it is a composite material that needs a coarse aggregate to achieve this strength. In essence, concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, and rocks. The cement or paste coats and binds the sand and rocks. Then, a chemical reaction called hydration, which is

The experimental results show: The MB value of machine-made sand has obvious negative effects on concrete performance and admixtures. The rock-powder content and the fineness module have relatively little influence on the working performance of concrete

## CNA - Machine-made sand self-compaction concrete - Google
The invention discloses a machine-made sand self-compacting concrete. The concrete is made from the following components according to parts by weight: 100 parts of cement, 25-45 parts of fly ash, 0-30 parts of mineral powder, 0.8-1.5 parts of a polycarboxylic acid water reducing agent, parts of machine-made sand, parts of cobble and parts of crushed stone.

## Research Trend of Machine-made Sand Concrete
Mar 7, 2022Machine-made sand. The use of machine-made sand as concrete fine aggregate instead of natural sand has become a new trend in the development of the concrete industry. However, there are the following unfavorable factors in the preparation process of machine-made sand: large specific surface area, irregular grain shape and unreasonable gradation
