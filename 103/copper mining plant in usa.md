Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. Problems that can be associated with mine drainage include contaminated drinking water, disrupted growth and reproduction of aquatic plants and animals, and the corroding effects of the acid on parts of infrastructures such as bridges.

This mechano-chemical process can leach 97-99% copper directly on site, from concentrates as low as 5% copper in less than six hours. This makes it feasible for you to produce cathode copper from concentrate directly at the site rather than to sell the concentrate to a smelter. The ROL process can even leach copper from arsenic-ladden concentrates.
