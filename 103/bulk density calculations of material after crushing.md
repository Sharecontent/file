## Density Calculator
The density of a material, typically denoted using the Greek symbol ρ, is defined as its mass per unit volume. ρ = m : V : where: ρ is the density m is the mass V is the volume. The calculation of density is quite straightforward. However, it is important to pay special attention to the units used for density calculations.

## Roche limit
In celestial mechanics, the Roche limit, also called Roche radius, is the distance from a celestial body within which a second celestial body, held together only by its own force of gravity, will disintegrate because the first body's tidal forces exceed the second body's gravitational self-attraction. Inside the Roche limit, orbiting material disperses and forms rings, whereas outside the
