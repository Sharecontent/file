## Double Roll Crusher | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
Roll crushers, or crushing rolls, or double roll crushers, are still used in some mills, although they have been replaced in most installations by cone crushers. They still have a useful application in handling friable, sticky, frozen, and less abrasive feeds, such as limestone, coal, chalk, gypsum, phosphate, and soft iron ores.

The lubrication of the interface between the parts of the jaw crusher is very important. It can minimize the friction generated during the operation, make the whole jaw crusher run smoothly, and extend its service life. Unlike gyratory crushers, the main lubrication used in jaw crushers is grease instead of oil.
