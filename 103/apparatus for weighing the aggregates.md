## Weigh hoppers and weighing units - Haarup
Weigh hoppers can be used for weighing aggregates as a separate unit or in combination with a moving weighing belt. A weigh hopper is suspended from load cells and can be installed above the mixer, a skip hoist or a belt conveyor that transports aggregates to the mixer. The hoist bucket itself can also function as a weigh hopper. The hoist
