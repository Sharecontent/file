##  Technical Note - Development in gold leaching using hydrogen peroxide
Peroxide assisted leach process (PAL) The intention of the process is to introduce oxygen in a liquid form. As a result of intensive research work, it could be shown that hydrogen peroxide can be used as a source of oxygen in the leaching of gold ores. To avoid side reactions, the following conditions must be applied:

## Increase Dissolved Oxygen in Gold Leaching with Hydrogen Peroxide
It is caused by the inefficient transfer of the gaseous oxygen through the phase barrier to the liquid phase. The dissolution rate drops and the cyanide-accessible gold and silver can not be extracted completely within the conventional leaching time of 48 hours. Hydrogen peroxide has a strong effect on the oxygen concentration of the pulp.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

## Process development for recovery of copper and precious metals from 
The precipitation of Au and Ag from acidic thiourea leachate was investigated by using different amounts of sodium borohydride (SBH) as a reducing agent. The leaching of Pd and remained gold from the solid reside of 3rd leaching step was performed in NaClO-HCl-H2O2 leaching system and the effect of different parameters was investigated.

For safety reasons, pH typically needs to be controlled in the 9.5-12.0 range depending on applications. While it feasible to achieve this using caustic, lime is usually the economical
