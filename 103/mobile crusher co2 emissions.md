Cumulative carbon dioxide emissions are the dominant driver of climate change. These began rising during the Industrial Revolution (especially after 1850)—which means richer countries like the United States, which made an early transition to a heavily fossil fuel-based economic system, have an outsized role in contributing to the climate impacts we see around the world today.

## Scopes 1, 2, and 3 of Carbon Emissions - Matmatch
Decreasing carbon emissions is quickly becoming not just a matter of corporate social responsibility for businesses but a necessity. Companies need to take stock and understand their carbon footprint to reduce emissions or reach a carbon-neutral status. Doing so requires understanding the scope 1, 2, and 3 type emissions involved in their central operation and upstream and downstream value chains.

The primary driver of increasing global CO 2 emissions between 2000 and 2019 was economic growth, as global GDP expanded about 80%.; Improving energy efficiency (energy use per unit of GDP) helped slow the growth in emissions, while global CO 2 intensity of energy use remained fairly constant, with increased coal use in some non-OECD countries offsetting emission reductions in the OECD countries.
