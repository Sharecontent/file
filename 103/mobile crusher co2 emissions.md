## Scopes 1, 2, and 3 of Carbon Emissions - Matmatch
Decreasing carbon emissions is quickly becoming not just a matter of corporate social responsibility for businesses but a necessity. Companies need to take stock and understand their carbon footprint to reduce emissions or reach a carbon-neutral status. Doing so requires understanding the scope 1, 2, and 3 type emissions involved in their central operation and upstream and downstream value chains.

The primary driver of increasing global CO 2 emissions between 2000 and 2019 was economic growth, as global GDP expanded about 80%.; Improving energy efficiency (energy use per unit of GDP) helped slow the growth in emissions, while global CO 2 intensity of energy use remained fairly constant, with increased coal use in some non-OECD countries offsetting emission reductions in the OECD countries.
