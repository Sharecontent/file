Phase identification and chemical compositions revealed that the iron ore content of the Jaruwa deposit is higher (68%) than that of the Agbaja deposit (53%). The phosphorus contents of both deposits are higher than 0.04% recommended for high grade iron ore. Iron ore from Agbaja deposit contains more silica and alumina than Jaruwa deposit.

Phosphate can cause brittleness in steel making it fracture, thus Agbaja was abandoned for Itakpe. Itakpe iron ore has no issues with phosphate but has low iron content, thus to make steel with Nigeria iron ore, a process called "beneficiation" has to be done to process the Itakpe ores to raise its iron content to meet the required standard

## Overcoming the phosphorous issue at the Agbaja iron ore  - AusIMM
The Agbaja Iron Ore project in Kogi State Nigeria is a unique sedimentary hosted channel iron goethite deposit. The sedimentary ore allows for a simple beneficiation circuit resulting in a low-cost concentrate feed for pre-reduction and smelting to produce steel billets. However, the ore contains high levels of phosphorous (1-2 %) which need to be reduced for the crude steel to be suitable for

Kogi's Managing Director, Iggy Tan said "the proposed Agbaja processing plant uses a very simple beneficiation process for magnetite ore which will keep operating costs low. Magnetite deposits are typically found in banded ironstone formations (BIFs) whereas Agbaja is one of only three known channel iron deposits (CID) to host potentially

The utilization of Agbaja iron ore is hampered by its poor response 5. 5 OLUSEGUN A. OLATINPO (2015) to established industrial beneficiation techniques. This is as a result of fine grained texture of the Agbaja iron ore (Uwadiale and Whewel, 1988)
