## Clean process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate 
A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.
