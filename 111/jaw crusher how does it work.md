## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work? | Oreflow
How do jaw crushers work? Jaw crushers use compressive force to break down large materials into smaller, more manageable pieces. It has two crushing jaws (one is stationary while the other one is moving) that produces mechanical pressure for crushing the materials. The two vertical crushing jaws create a V-shaped opening called the crushing
