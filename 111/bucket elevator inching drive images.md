## Inching Drives - What do they do? How do they Work?
Inching drives are units that provide slow-speed operation of conveyor or elevator systems in order to facilitate maintenance and inspection. An inching drive, which contains its own gearbox reducer to achieve the slower speeds, can be installed between the driving motor and the main drive system, or it can connect to the main drive system separately from the main motor.

## Inching drives - one way to improve mill safety - Metso Outotec
The typical mechanical inching drive motor speed is around 1500 to 1800 RPM while the mill inching speed is in the order of 0.1 to 0.15 RPM. Thus, the gear reduction ratio between the inching drive motor and the mill is roughly 12,000 to 1. What this means is that the inching drive motor must turn 12,000 times to be able to turn the mill once.

The so-called full bucket elevator has closely spaced containers and is suitable for low speed transport applications. The material is filled directly into the buckets before elevation and at the top is tipped out of the inverted buckets into the outlet chute. Centrifugal bucket elevators are normally used for high speeds and finer grain sizes.
