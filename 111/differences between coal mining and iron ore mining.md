One coal thumper works for 2 gathering posts. Thats 30 worker. Coal mine only 10 workers. Plus base heat level is higher. Wait I forgot to ask, the 30 workers is for 560 a day and for the mining 10 works is for 240 right? one is 18 per worker, the other is 24 per worker which is only 33% more efficient.
