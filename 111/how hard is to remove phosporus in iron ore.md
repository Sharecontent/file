## Bacterial Extraction of Phosphorus from Iron Ore
Phosphorus is a problem in ironmaking feedstocks, as phosphorus in iron gives the metal undesirable properties. Some iron ore sources have significant levels of phosphate minerals that are difficult to remove, and so use of ore from these sources requires the iron and steel plants to remove the excess phosphorus from the molten metal.
