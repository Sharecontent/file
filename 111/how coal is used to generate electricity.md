## how much coal is used for electricity - Alex Becker Marketing
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity.

And there are coal pieces burn and the thermal energy from the burning coal is used to boil water and generate steam. From that moment steam pushes the blades of the turbine, which connect with the generator, that gives electricity to the transformer. Thereby the electric current is sent through the power lines to businesses and homes.

## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over. Read More.

In a turbine generator, a moving fluid—water, steam, combustion gases, or air—pushes a series of blades mounted on a rotor shaft. The force of the fluid on the blades spins/rotates the rotor shaft of a generator.

## Mapped: How Germany generates its electricity - Carbon Brief
The data in our interactive map reveals some interesting changes in the types of infrastructure being built to generate Germany's electricity. The chart below gives an at-a-glance summary of the shifts in the country's grid mix since 1960. It also shows the ever-present coal plants that still supply around half of Germany's power.
