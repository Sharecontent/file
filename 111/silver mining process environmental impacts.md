## Mining and Its Environmental Impacts | SpringerLink
Environmental impacts of mining appear to be most well known all over the world - almost beyond the necessity of further elucidation and questioning ([2, 3]; Table 1).The mining industry has recognized its impact on the environment and has identified the control and restriction of such impact as one of its key challenges [4, 47].

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.

## Why recycled silver is the better choice - Ida & Volta
When silver is not recycled, it is newly mined. About 30% of silver comes from actual silver mines, the remaining 70% is a by-product of mining for other metals. Both mining practices come at a high environmental and social cost. Miners of the silver mines of Potosi, Bolivia; Mining silver greatly impacts the environment.

In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

## Silver mining
Silver mining required large amounts of mercury to extract the metal from ore. In the Andes, the source was the Huancavelica mercury mine; Mexico was dependent on mercury from the Almadén mercury mine in Spain. Mercury had a high adverse environmental impact. Silver was extremely valuable in China, and became a global commodity.

The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.

## The impact of lithium mining on the environment, what's behind clean 
The mining process is mainly divided into spodumene open-pit mining and salt lake brine extraction of lithium. It has to be mentioned that since the 1990s, China has become a major country in the lithium industry. But there is a large technological gap in lithium ore mining.

To assess the environmental impacts caused by different stages, it is necessary to calculate the life-cycle environmental impacts on the beneficiation stage of mining. Life cycle environmental impact analysis is a powerful tool which aims to analyse the details of environmental effects from cradle to gate of a product, system, or process.

Gold is a bigger problem than silver, simply because gold is rarer and more precious. It is present at much lower concentrations in the ore, so more damage is done getting a given amount of gold out of the ground. But silver is subject to all the same problems - metal ores often occur together, so they actually come from many of the same mines.
