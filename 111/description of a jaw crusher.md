## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 Ã— 1.7 = 78 cm.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing
