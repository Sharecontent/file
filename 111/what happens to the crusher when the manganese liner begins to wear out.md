## what happens to the crusher when the manganese liner begins to wear out
 · • Do not wear the manganese liners beyond the scheduled replacement. Again, keeping an accurate log (amp draw or bowl float) and daily visual inspections will assist in this task. Schmidt said, according to manufacturers, a manganese liner should be considered worn out when its weight equals 40 - 60 percent of when it was new.

These properties make the manganese alloy extremely resilient, and the liners can take a lot strain before they become worn out. Any cracking or holes that appear in liners prematurely can usually be attributed to manufacturing errors. Manganese wear parts are sold in 3 common grades, 14% (Hadfield manganese), 18% and 21+% grades.

## What Happens To The Crusher When The Manganese Liner Begins To Wear Out
Liner Wear In Jaw Crushers Sciencedirect. Jan 01, 2003 Wear in rock crushers causes great costs in the mining and aggregates industry. Change of the geometry of the crusher liners is a major reason for these costs. Being able to predict the geometry of a worn crusher will help designing the crusher liners for improved performance.
