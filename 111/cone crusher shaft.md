## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Compression crushers include jaw crushers, cone crushers, gyratory crushers and roll crushers. Impact crushers include vertical shaft impactors or horizontal shaft impactors. Compression crushers require much less maintenance; high impact crushers undergo more wear and tear due to the material colliding within the crusher.
