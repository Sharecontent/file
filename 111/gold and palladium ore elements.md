## Learn About Rhodium, a Rare Platinum Group Metal - ThoughtCo
The first step in extracting rhodium from the ore is precipitating precious metals such as gold, silver, palladium, and platinum. The remaining ore is treated with sodium bisulfate NaHSO 4 and melted, resulting in rhodium (III) sulfate, Rh 2 (SO 4) 3.

and gold in a cost effective manner. An area of research that has the potential of improving PGM and gold analysis is the use of co-collectors. The aim of the project was to determine if both Iridium and Ruthenium are useful co-collectors for precious metals e.g Platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold in ores and concentrate material.

Both generate in the Nether. Platinum ore generates at gold rarity, but in all altitudes. Palladium ore generates at layers 22 and below, once every 16 chunks. Platinum is light pink. Palladium is light blue. Both ores can be smelted into ingots. Each can craft into mineral blocks and weighted pressure plates. Probably no new tool or armour tiers.

Analysis. Palladium is the most expensive of the four major precious metals - gold, silver and platinum being the others. It is rarer than platinum, and is used in larger quantities for catalytic converters. In the near-term, the demand for metals used in catalytic converters is expected to be steady, buoyed by growing automotive sales in Asia.
