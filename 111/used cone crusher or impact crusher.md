## THE 8 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IMPACT CRUSHER AND CONE CRUSHER - ZENITH Crusher
The hardness of materials crushed by impact crusher and cone crusher is different. Cone crusher is mainly used to crush some materials with higher hardness, such as granite, basalt, tuff, river pebble, etc. Impact crusher is often used to crush materials with small hardness and brittleness, such as limestone, limestone, etc. 4.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.
