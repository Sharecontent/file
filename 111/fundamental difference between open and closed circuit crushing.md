## what is open circuit crushing - Welcome to Tables & Thyme
Mar 01, 2021· An open circuit is defined as an electric circuit in which current does not flow. Current can only flow in a circuit if it finds a continuous path—known as a "closed circuit". If there's a break anywhere in the circuit, you have an open circuit, and current can not flow. In an open circuit, the two terminals are disconnected.
