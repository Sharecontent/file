To do so, wait until the wheel has completely stopped and the grinder is properly locked out before using a grinder safety gauge.

For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.
