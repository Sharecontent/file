Although feldspars are the most common minerals in igneous and metamorphic rocks, feldspars are less stable than quartz at conditions near the Earth's surface. Thus feldspars make up only 10-15% of all sandstones.  The main factor that creates the basins necessary to form clastic sedimentary rocks is tectonics. Once a basin is formed, the

The difference is, that out of more than 200 recognized gemstones, at least 12 of those are variations of quartz, while only 4 of them are variations of feldspar. This is most likely due to the fact that quartz is a harder mineral than feldspar. If something can be scratched or broken more easily, it is considered less valuable.

## Granite: Igneous Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Granite is a light-colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth's surface. Granite is composed mainly of quartz and feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles, and other minerals. This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray

In geology, a rock is a naturally occurring solid aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. For example, the common rock, granite, is a combination of the quartz, feldspar and biotite minerals. The Earth's outer solid layer, the lithosphere, is made of rock. Rocks have been used by mankind throughout history.
