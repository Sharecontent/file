The cost can go up to $150,000 if the robot is fully customizable. The final cost of a welding robot varies greatly based on its required. Depending on the configuration, the cost may be $50,000 or more, depending on the model and the supplier. However, if you're only using it part-time, a robotic welder may not be a good choice for you.

In addition to labor, electrode, and shielding gas costs, the charge for the electricity needed to power the welding machines was incorporated into the total welding costs. Although in our example the cost of electricity per pound of weld metal never exceeded $0.40, this value is not insignificant and therefore was included in the calculations.

## Is Welding Expensive? (Breaking Down the Costs)
Labor Costs. In many ways, welding is more than just a functional method of joining metal. It can really be considered an art form, which is why, when it comes to hiring a professional, the most expensive factor is labor costs. For most projects, labor costs make up to 60 to 70 percent of the total price, but can even extend to 85 percent.

## Development of low cost linear friction welding machines - TWI
Linear friction welding has been demonstrated for virtually all types of engineering alloys, such as titanium ( Fig.1), steel, stainless steel, aluminium and inter-metallics, but the uptake of the process by industry has been impaired by the high capital cost of existing mechanical linear friction welding machines.Novel solutions have been devised to reduce the manufacturing cost of the
