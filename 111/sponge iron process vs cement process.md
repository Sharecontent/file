## Gas Sweetening using Iron Sponge Process - Chemical Engineering Portal
Iron sponge process is economically applied for gases containing small concentration of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), usually less than 300 ppm, operating from low to moderate pressure in a range of 3.45-34.5 barg (50-500 psig). Iron sponge process cannot be used to remove carbon dioxide. Iron sponge process is the oldest and still the most widely

## Sponge iron process for manned space exploration | ACT of ESA
The Sponge Iron Process (SIR) is a well-known technology for the production and purification of hydrogen. It consists of a cyclic process in which a feed gas, rich in carbon monoxide and hydrogen (e.g. syngas), is passed on an iron oxide (magnetite Fe3O4) at high temperature. Magnetite is reduced to wuestite (FeO) or iron while carbon monoxide

Summary - Sponge Iron vs Pig Iron. Both sponge iron and pig iron are two basic forms of iron that we can obtain via processing natural iron ore. The key difference between sponge iron and pig iron is that we can produce sponge iron by direct reduction of iron ore through reducing agents whereas the production of pig iron is by melting iron

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting
