## Sand and Gravel Mining - Encyclopedia of Arkansas
Worldwide, more sand and gravel is mined annually than any other industrial raw material. Preliminary estimates of sand and gravel production in Arkansas for 2007 by the U.S. Geological Survey are nearly 9.1 million metric tons valued at $66,300,000. Nearly fifty percent was used for concrete aggregate and concrete products.

## Sand Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Offshore sand and gravel extraction involves the abstraction of sediments from a bed which is always covered with seawater. This activity started in the early 20th century (in the mid-1920s, in the United Kingdom), but did not reach a significant scale until the 1960s and 1970s, when markets for marine sand and gravel expanded and dredging technology improved (Fig. 1).
