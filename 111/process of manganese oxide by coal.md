Elemental manganese readily combines with oxygen, carbon, and silicon to form a long list of manganese minerals. Manganese ores generally contain 25 to 45 percent manganese, mostly in oxide (or hydroxide) and carbonate minerals. Manganese ores are widespread, but most of the world's supply is from a small number of manganese mining districts.

## Stabilization of layered manganese oxide by substitutional cation 
Manganese oxides (δ-MnO 2) with a layered structure are considered as potential electrode materials due to the presence of an extra ion transport channel between interlayers.However, their dissolution and structure collapse during the electrochemical charge and discharge process usually lead to rapid capacity fading.

OCCURRENCE Manganese (Mn) is abundant in the earth's crust, and occurs in many minerals numbered in the hundreds, but only a few are deemed economic to process for commercial use. Pyrolusite (Manganese Oxide) MnO2 and Rhodochrosite (Manganese Carbonate) MnCO3 are the main minerals mined and processed to saleable products.

## Treating Manganese in Well Water - Pure Water Products, LLC
TDS: Softeners remove manganese best if the total dissolved solids (TDS) of the water is low. When TDS is high, other minerals in the water compete with the manganese for space on the resin and can even displace manganese which has attached to the resin. Water with <500 ppm TDS works best for manganese removal by a water softener.

Manganese oxides formation The mixed valent oxide Mn.O occurs in nature as the mineral hasumannite. The stmcture of this ferromagnetic material has been the subject of much dispute. Mn.O is the most stable of the manganese oxides, and is formed when any of the other oxides or hydroxides are heated in air above 940—1000°C. The oxidation of aqueous solutions of Mn (OH)2 can also lead to the
