## Types and basic principles of existing crushers
Impactstyle crushers include VSIs as well as horizontal shaft impactors (HSIs) and are best used with less abrasive rock types like limestone. These types of machines break apart material by the impacting forces of certain wear parts known as blow bars and impact plates or toggles.. Some operations also use impactstyle crushers
