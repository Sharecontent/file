## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes - a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore. Since limestone is the main

## Cement Manufacturing Process - Chemical Engineering World
Sep 26, 2020Cement Manufacturing Process. Cement is a material which is used to bind other materials together. Binding means it has an effect of gluing the substances together due to cohesive and adhesive action and then hardens and sets in order to become permanent. Cement is usually not used on its own; it is mixed with other materials called aggregates

Manufacture of cement - consists of mixing, burning, and grinding processes. 1. Mixing: It may be a wet process or by dry process.In a wet process wash mill is used which is a heavy cylinder of 2.5 to 3.0 m in diameter and 9 to 12 m in length. It is kept slightly inclined to the horizontal and can rotate at 15-20 revolutions per minute. The cylinder is provided with steel balls.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
