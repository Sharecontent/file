Break ground with either a shovel or a trench digger. The depth will depend on how much water you need to funnel away. However deep you dig, remember the width of the trench should be greater than the depth. You want a gentle slope from the edges of the trench to the center. You don't want a deep, steep ditch, but a shallow, sloping one instead.
