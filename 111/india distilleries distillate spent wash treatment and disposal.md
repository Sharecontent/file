## Distillery spent wash: Treatment technologies and potential 
Disposal of distillery spent wash on land is equally hazardous to the vegetation. It is reported to reduce soil alkalinity and manganese availability, thus inhibiting seed germination .Kannan and Upreti reported highly toxic effects of raw distillery effluent on the growth and germination of Vigna radiata seeds even at low concentration of 5% (v/v).

ABSTRACT: Distilleries generating huge amount of acidic, recalcitrant and colored wastewaters with high organic content. The dark brown color of Distillery wastewater is mainly due to the high molecular weight organic compounds called melanoidin. Wastewater disposal into the environment is hazardous and has a considerable pollution potential.
