## What does Gold Look Like in Nature? Identify Real Gold
The gold bearing material is called ore. Identifying gold bearing ore just by visual inspection can be very difficult, or even impossible, depending on the concentration of the gold within the rock. Many ores that contain gold contain other metallic metals in them also, so there are likely to be a lot of shiny minerals mixed into the rock which
