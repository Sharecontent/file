## Incline vs. Horizontal Screen Aggregate Equipment
Incline Screens . Incline screens operate from 20 degrees to 39 degrees and vibrate in a circular motion to move feed. The combination of a steep angle and vibration enable a high processing rate versus horizontal screen. However, this also limits the amount of time feed spends on the screen, limiting sorting efficiency.

## Our dimension of inclined screens to screen sand
The ® Finlay 696 2-deck mobile inclined screen has been developed to fulfil the demands of high production producers in quarrying, mining, sand and gravel, coal, woodchip and topsoil applications. The new high energy screenbox features two full size 6.1m x 1.7m (20' x 5' 7") decks to give a total screening area of 20.74m² (223ft²).
