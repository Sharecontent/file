## The burden of chronic mercury intoxication in artisanal small-scale 
Artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a poverty-driven activity practiced in over 70 countries worldwide. Zimbabwe is amongst the top ten countries using large quantities of mercury to extract gold from ore. This analysis was performed to check data availability and derive a preliminary estimate of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) due to mercury use in ASGM in Zimbabwe.

## Small-Scale Mining in Africa: Tackling Pressing Environmental Problems 
Small-scale mining—low-tech mineral extraction and processing—has long been an important industry in Africa. For centuries, operations have provided inhabitants of the rural, more impoverished regions of the continent with a wealth of employment benefits and, more recently, have made important contributions to mineral wealth and foreign exchange earnings.
