Bury the pipe so that water streaming to that area will flow through the culvert and not over your path. If you are adding a border, lay that now by digging down about ½ the thickness of the border material. For a 4x4 border, you will dig a 2-inch deep by 2-inch wide trench laying boarder timber as you go. A grub hoe works well for this purpose.

## Is exposure to airborne concrete, stone, brick, or granite dust 
When materials such as concrete, stone, brick, or granite are cut or ground by workers, it can create extremely fine dust particles, which can make their way deep into the lungs if inhaled. These silica dust particles can cause scarring in the lungs, leading to a serious and irreversible lung condition known as silicosis.
