## Froth Flotation and Gold Extraction - Manhattan Gold & Silver
Froth flotation is a method for separating hydrophobic materials (which will not mix with water) from hydrophilic materials (which readily mix with water). Since its discovery, froth flotation has been a major component for the processing of sulfide-rich ores, including copper, coal, and refractory gold. In gold mining, froth flotation is used

Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules. First, ore is ground into an extremely fine powder. The powdered ore is mixed with water to create a slurry, which is mixed with surfactants to increase the gold's hydrophobicity. This mixture is placed into a large tank filled with distilled water.
