## Smart Blind Stick Using Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensors
Five key components are needed to build this project, these are two ultrasonic Sensors, an Arduino board, Buzzer, and a Vibration motor. Two ultrasonic sensors are used to detects obstacles at different hight. Then these sensors send data to the Arduino board. Now the Arduino calculates the distance between the sensor and the obstacle.

## Working principle of vibration motor China
Working principle of vibration motor. The mini vibration motor mainly used for mobile phones belongs to the DC brush motor. The motor shaft has an eccentric weight. When the motor rotates, the center point of the eccentric weight is not on the center of the motor, so that the motor is in a state of constant loss of balance.

## Elephant
Etymology. The word "elephant" is based on the Latin elephas (genitive elephantis) ("elephant"), which is the Latinised form of the Greek ἐλέφας (elephas) (genitive ἐλέφαντος (elephantos), probably from a non-Indo-European language, likely Phoenician. It is attested in Mycenaean Greek as e-re-pa (genitive e-re-pa-to) in Linear B syllabic script.
