## Energy needed to produce aluminum
Bauxite is then converted into aluminum oxide, or alumina, using natural gas at plants located in the southern United States. After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum. In this process, alumina is dissolved in a solution and a strong electric current is applied.

The Basics of Aluminum Mining and Processing. Bauxite ore, found in flat, layered deposits beneath the surface of the earth, is loosened with explosives once bulldozers have cleared the surface above. Using the Bayer Process, which involves the use of heat, pressure and sodium hydroxide, the aluminum oxide is separated from impurities, as well.Here you can find the meaning of In the extraction

aluminium silicate may react to form aluminium hydroxide. Rock containing high concentra-tions of aluminium hydroxide is called bauxite. This rock is the usual starting material for the production of aluminium. Metallurgical-grade alumina (Al 2 O 3) extracted from bauxite by the Bayer process is generally referred to as the ore (Sanders, 2002).

Bauxite is primarily comprised of aluminum oxide compounds (alumina), silica, iron oxides and titanium dioxide. Approximately 70 percent of the world's bauxite production is refined through the Bayer chemical process into alumina. Alumina is then refined into pure aluminum metal through the Hall-Héroult electrolytic process. Mining bauxite

## What Useful Material May Be Obtained From Bauxite
Bauxite ore is the world's primary source of aluminum.The ore must first be chemically processed to produce alumina (aluminum oxide). Alumina is then smelted using an electrolysis process to produce pure aluminum metal.

## Bauxite and Alumina Statistics and Information - USGS
Bauxite is a naturally occurring, heterogeneous material composed primarily of one or more aluminum hydroxide minerals, plus various mixtures of silica, iron oxide, titania, aluminosilicate, and other impurities in minor or trace amounts. The principal aluminum hydroxide minerals found in varying proportions with bauxites are gibbsite and the
