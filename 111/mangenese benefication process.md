The oxidation process is completed in the zeolite media filter, and the precipitate is filtered out. The filter is periodically backwashed to remove the precipitant. Oxidizing filters can be used with ferrous or ferric iron, and manganous or manganic manganese. The minimum pH is 7.0. A pH of 8.0 is needed when the manganese concentration is high.
