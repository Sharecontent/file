## Performability Analysis of Multistate Ash Handling System of Thermal 
This work seeks to propose a Petri nets-based technique for evaluating the performability features of ash handling system of a coal-based thermal power plant. The impact of failure and repair parameters on system performance has been determined. For the modelling of the system Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) an extended version of Petri nets is applied. The recommended methodology used in this
