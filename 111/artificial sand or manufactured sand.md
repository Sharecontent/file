## Difference Between M Sand Vs River Sand | What is M-Sand  - CivilJungle
M Sand is nothing but artificial sand made from crushing of rock or granite for construction purposes in cement or concrete. M sand differs from natural river sand in its physical and mineralogical properties. Sand is one of the important ingredients at making concrete mortar & plaster, etc.. Earth scientists and organizations are now promoting the use of M-Sand(Manufactured Sand).
