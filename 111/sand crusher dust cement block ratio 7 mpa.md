## Cement to sand ratio for mortar, brickwork and plastering
There are various cement to sand ratios for each element of the building construction. It is generally as follows:-1) For masonry construction block/ brick work, ratio of cement to sand is = 1:3, 1:4, 1:5 and 1:6. 2) For reinforced concrete, ratio of cement to sand (fine aggregate) is = 1:2, 1:1.5, and 1:1.

## compressive strength of quarry waste as coarse aggregate in concrete
From the comparative studies of the experimental results, reflected in Table 7, it is noted that the compressive strength of concrete surges with the increase in slag substitution ratio. The enhancement in compressive strength due to the replacement of natural sand with 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% steel slag is %, %, %, and %, respectively.

Concrete is of course designed specifically for weight-bearing applications, such as for the building of foundations, beams, and other such things. When it comes down to it, concrete is much stronger than expanding foam. If you have a very heavy fence post, it might cause the expanding foam to warp or crack over time.

## Cement Sand Aggregate Ratio in Concrete Mix | How to calculate?
Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.
