Alumina levels range from 5.9% to 8.8% and are reduced to 2.8% after processing. The iron ore wash plant also removes clays from the feed material and the combined effect means the Fe content increases from between 43.4% and 52.7% in the feed to above 60% iron ore product, with a yield of up to 50%.
