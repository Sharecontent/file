## Bauxite Mine Fight Looms in Jamaica's Cockpit Country
24th October 2006. Drilling for bauxite samples in Jamaica's Cockpit Country is threatening the plants and animals that live in the region's moist tropical limestone forest, said conservationists today. Bauxite is the raw material for aluminum. Cockpit Country is in northwestern Jamaica near the tourist resorts of Montego Bay and Ocho Rios.

Bauxite Ore from mining in Jamaica. The Bayer Process is the main industrial way of refining bauxite to produce aluminum. Bauxite is the most important ore in aluminum but it has only thirty (30) to fifty-four (54) percent aluminum oxide. The remaining mixtures to produce aluminum are titanium dioxide, silica, and other iron oxides.

Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum and is a mixture of aluminum oxides and hydroxides that formed from intense chemical weathering of a soil in tropical environments. Soils formed under these conditions are termed laterites. In Arkansas, the aluminum-enriched soils are the result of the decomposition and lateritic weathering of nepheline syenite, an intrusive igneous rock. During the

Less than 50% of all bauxite mined in Jamaica is domestically refined into alumina, and the country has no aluminumsmelting capacity. About 20% of all bauxite mined in Guyana is domestically refined into alumina, and the country produces no aluminum ingot. Guyana, however, produces a large percentage of the world's refractory-grade bauxite.

Bauxite or 'red dirt', the raw material used in the production of aluminium, has been extracted in Jamaica by open-cast mining since 1952. In the 1960s Jamaica was the leading producer in the world and the industry expanded over the years to include four large refineries which process most of the raw bauxite into alumina before it is exported.

Moreover, soil in bauxite mines have high levels of Al (as bauxite ore is essentially Al2O3, Fe2O3and SiO2), limiting the growth of microbes in soil. Without microbiological activity, nutrients are not released into soil, restricting plant growth in acidic soil. This prevents post-mining biological land reclamation.
