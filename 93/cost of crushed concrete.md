## Gravel or Crushed Concrete for a Driveway?
crushed concrete is a recycled product, so it would be best for you to make a trip to the source of the gravel and pick up a handful and look for the fines in it.  If the costs are the same, I'd choose the gravel over the crushed concrete. The crushed concrete will tend to have sharp edges to it, making it less desirable for a driveway.
