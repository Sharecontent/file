## Black granite mining: The bane of Mutoko - The Standard
The mining activities of close to 50 years have seen women being confined to the kitchen whilst able-bodied men are wasted through hard labour and exposure to dust at the mines. Women generally feel they are relegated to the peripheries of the economic gains of granite mining in the district. "Whenever these companies hire, they only hire men.

## How Granite Gets Different Colors? - RegattaGranitesIndia
It looks simple yet has a royal appeal. An iron- and magnesium-rich igneous rock, known as gabbro is responsible for the black color of granite. In technical terms, a stone must have at least 20% concentration of quartz, which imparts a white to milky shade to granite. Sadly, black granite, like Absolute Black and Black Galaxy granite do not

Second Quality stones have natural veining that might make the presentation look inconsistent. There may be small to medium rocks in the stone that do not match the pattern and there may be small cracks somewhere near the edges of the stone. Some stones that are considered second quality will have a less consistent surface texture or pattern.
