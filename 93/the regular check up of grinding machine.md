## Up vs. down grinding | Cutting Tool Engineering
You don't have a choice in many applications because of machine or part-geometry restrictions. But if you do, up grinding provides 5 to 10 percent less wheel wear than down grinding—or maybe none at all. So, beware of outrageous claims. I've witnessed hearsay on the shop floor where some guy in some shop tripled wheel life by switching

## Dressing Technique for Truing Up Diamond Grinding Wheels
This positioning of the dresser wheel axis at a 90-degree angle is the XING dressing technique. "For diamond wheel dressing, the dressing wheel still wears as much as or more than the grinding wheel, but now the dressing wheel is always a perfect radius," Mr. Drechsler says. "So that eliminates one of the huge variables in that process.".
