## Summary of Gold Extraction Process
Definition:Gold extraction refers to the process of separating gold from gold-bearing ore. The content of gold in nature is low. In order to extract gold, it is usually necessary to first crush and grind the gold ore and use the extraction method to separate gold from the ore. For different gold-bearing ores, the selection of gold extraction

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by
