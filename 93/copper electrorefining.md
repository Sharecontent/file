## When is electrorefining used? Explained by FAQ Blog
Electrorefining entails electrochemically dissolving copper from impure copper anodes into an electrolyte containing CuSO 4 and H 2 SO 4 and then electrochemically depositing pure copper from the electrolyte onto stainless steel or copper cathodes. The process is continuous.

## During the electrorefining of copper the anode is made of?
Typical industrial electrorefining of copper is carried out at copper ion concentrations of 35 to 55 g/l and sulfate ion concentrations of 150 to 250 g/l. With the high flow rate, it may be possible to reduce these concentrations slightly because of the higher mass transport in the electrolyte.

Copper electrorefining is widely applied in the world to produce Grade-A copper (>99.99%) that can be further processed to make copper wires and rods. Copper anodes with purities of about 98%-99% from smelters are dissolved into cupric ions as current goes through. These cupric ions are then selectively electro-deposited on cathode sheets.

## Electrorefining Copper - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
This report discusses Electrorefining Copper research conducted to increase the rate, deposit purity, and overall efficiency in industrial processes used to electrodeposit and purify metals by increasing substantially the operating current density range and optimizing the deposition process.Traditionally, copper refineries operate electrolytic cells at a current density of 20 amp/ft².

## Copper Scrap Recycling-Metal Recycling- - Metalcess
Recycling of copper scrap greatly reduces natural resource exploration as an alternative source of copper metallurgy and has big advantage in investment, production cost and off-gas treatment, thus making the copper scrap smelting projects remunerative. However, due to the wide source range, the copper scrap is classified as per its grade, to

## Settling Properties of Copper Electrorefining Anode Slimes
The settling properties of anode slime in copper electrorefining have crucial effect on copper cathode quality. Anode slime settling is affected by electrolyte composition and temperature, electrolyte circulation, and the sizes and density of the slime particles and agglomerates. Typically, the industrial copper electrolytes contain 40-60 g
