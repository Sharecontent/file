## In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? | Sciencing
Quartz. •••. Gold is most often found in quartz rock. When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides. The white color of quartz makes it easy to spot in many environments.

## Classification of Mineral Deposits | Geology for Investors
Most mineral deposits are formed by more than one process, so attaching a single label to them is difficult. Hence, there is a tendency to talk about Stillwater Complex type or Carlin-type gold deposits, which rather defeats the purpose of finding a general from the specific. There are two main approaches to mineral deposit classification.
