## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are

## Gyratory Crusher Explained - saVRee
Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the 'Primary Crusher'. Cone crushers are typically used for 2 nd, 3 rd & 4 th stage crushing steps (although not always).

## Crusher
A cone crusher is similar in operation to a gyratory crusher, with less steepness in the crushing chamber and more of a parallel zone between crushing zones. A cone crusher breaks rock by squeezing the rock between an eccentrically gyrating spindle, which is covered by a wear-resistant mantle, and the enclosing concave hopper, covered by a

Cone crushers and gyratory crushers are mainly used as secondary crushers in a crushing plant. Crushed product from the primary crusher (usually Jaw Crusher) is fed through the top of the cone crusher and flows over the mantle. A vertical drive shaft rotates the mantle eccentrically below the bowl liner, squeezing the product and crushing it

Cone crusher looks like gyratory crusher but without a steep crushing chamber. Just like jaw crusher, it is also a compression type crusher whose reduction ratio is 4:1 to 6:1. When cone crusher works, it uses the force between moveable mantle and stationary bowl liner to crush material. As the material is getting smaller, it keeps moving down
