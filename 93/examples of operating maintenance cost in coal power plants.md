## Electric Generating Costs: A Primer - IER
The cost of generating electricity includes the capital cost, the financing charges, and the production or operating costs (including fuel and maintenance of the technology) at the point of connection to an electrical load or the electricity grid. When determining what new plant to build, a utility company will compare all these costs across the slate of available generating units.

## Comparing Maintenance Costs - Efficient Plant
Use cost/ERV to set long-term goals, along with targets for plant reliability. Cost/ERV is one of the most widely used metrics available. World-class plants tend to fall in the range of 1 to 2.5 percent MT. Edwin K. Jones, P.E., is a consultant based in Newark, DE. He can be contacted at (302) ; e-mail jjones1432@aol.
