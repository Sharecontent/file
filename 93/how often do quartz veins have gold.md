## In What Rock Formations Can Gold Be Found? | Sciencing
Quartz. •••. Gold is most often found in quartz rock. When quartz is found in gold bearings areas, it is possible that gold will be found as well. Quartz may be found as small stones in river beds or in large seams in hillsides. The white color of quartz makes it easy to spot in many environments.

This can be an indicator of gold. Iron Staining & Gossans: Not all veins produce much quartz - gold bearing veins can consist of calcite or mostly sulfides - which often weather into iron stained spots when the pyrites convert to iron oxides. Large amounts of iron oxides like hematite, magnetite and ironstone can be favorable indicators.

Answer (1 of 12): No they do not. Quartz is common, gold is rare. Quartz veins typically form when very hot water rising from depth flows into a shallow crack in the rock. The dissolved silica precipitates as quartz. If there is gold present in the water, it will also precipitate. The result is

Quartz veins are also important host rocks for gold and other precious metals, and were the target of many mining 'rushes'. From a historic perspective, however, the single most important use of quartz may have been to start fires. When chert is struck against iron, it produces a relatively long-lived spark.
