## Can wet grinder be used for dry grinding?145
What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.

## Wet vs Dry Grinding
Re: Wet vs Dry grinding. Dry Grinding has limitation due to low threshold of release of kinetic energy to grind the solids. and the heat generation in the process of dry grinding . In wet Grinding process, can go upto NANO size particles easily. If you have any specific problem can contact me on jadhwani@hotmail.

## Step by Step Guide to the Wet Grinding Process: Everything You Need to Know
Step 1: Wetting. The first step to wet grinding is eliminating air from the surface of the raw feed, so that each individual particle is fully in contact with the liquid slurry. Ensuring complete contact is vital for effective milling. This requires a liquid with lower surface tension than the free surface energy of the solid.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: Raw Grinding Plant
Dry grinding requires approximately 30 % more energy / wt. of ground material. Dry mills need more mill volume than comparable wet mills. However, the increased metal wear of the grinding media and the mill liners for wet grinding, equalizes the additional energy costs of dry grinding procedures ~ 30 - 40 % of wear costs in wet grinding.

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.
