## Environmental News Network - A "Win-Win" Situation for Acid Mine Drainage
Acid Mine Drainage is one of the greatest environmental hazards that is associated with mining processes and degrades more than 4,500 stream miles in the mid-Atlantic region of the US alone. When water flows through abandoned and active coal mines, a reaction occurs between the water and the rocks containing sulfur bearing minerals.

Minerals associated with mid-ocean ridges include iron, zinc, copper, lead, gold, and silver. Historic examples of volcanic massive sulphide deposits include the Troodos copper-iron complex in Cyprus. The massive sulphides and related stockwork occurs within a basaltic pillow lava sequence. Similar mineralisation occurs in Semail, Oman.

When companies break up materials during mining, the dust can release a variety of heavy metals commonly associated with health problems. As dust, these minerals (such as the asbestos-like mineral riebeckite) can be absorbed into lung tissue, causing problems like pneumoconiosis and silicosis, commonly known as "Black Lung" (Paul & Campbell, 2011).
