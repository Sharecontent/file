Portland cement concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, water, coarse and ﬁne aggregates, and admixtures proportioned to form a plastic mass capable of being cast, placed, or molded into forms that will harden to a solid mass. The desirable properties of plastic concrete are that it be workable, placeable, and non-segregating and that is set at the desired time.

## ELE International - Sampling and Preparation of Aggregates
Sampling and preparation of aggregates and fillers is necessary for a variety of reasons including research, design and quality control. The main aim of sampling is to obtain a sample representative of the average quality. Sampling techniques and procedures are described in various standards including BS 812: Part 101 and 102 and ASTM D75.

## Cement: Characteristics, Properties, Composition, Harmful Constituents 
The most of the alkalies present in raw materials are carried away by the Hue gases during heating and the cement contains only a small amount of alkalies. If they are in excess in cement, they cause a number of troubles such as alkali-aggregate reaction, efflorescence and staining when used in concrete, brickwork or masonry mortar.
