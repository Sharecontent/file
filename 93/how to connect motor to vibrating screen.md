Loose anchor bolts is one of the main faults that cause the vibration motor to burn out. Due to its special structure, the eccentric masses at both ends of the vibration motor that generate the exciting force are driven by the motor, and the impact force on the anchor bolts can be energy per minute. Up to hundreds of times, even thousands of times.
