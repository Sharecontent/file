Classification: High Calcium Marl: CaO ≥ 45% ; Low calcium marl: CaO <45%. In some places, the composition of marl is close to the raw material for making cement. It can be directly fired into cement, which is called natural cement rock. Main mineral is calcite. White peony: also named chalk, it is a mixture of shells and of marine organisms.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## How Cement Is Made
The most common way to manufacture portland cement is through a dry method. The first step is to quarry the principal raw materials, mainly limestone, clay, and other materials. After quarrying the rock is crushed. This involves several stages. The first crushing reduces the rock to a maximum size of about 6 inches.

## Material Performance Tests of the Polymer-Cement Thin Spray  - Hindawi
2.2. Test Method 2.2.1. Preparation of Materials. The composition of the TSL material is shown in Table 5.The polymer emulsion with a polymer-cement ratio of 5-20% had better mechanical properties [30-32].Therefore, in order to screen the most suitable polymer emulsion for the TSL material and the mixing ratio, we evaluated polymer-cement ratios of 5, 10, 15, and 20%.

## Limestone quarry, quarrying, cement raw materials
Quarrying. Most of the raw materials used are extracted from the earth through mining and quarrying and can be divided into the following groups: lime (calcareous), silica (siliceous), alumina (argillaceous), and iron (ferriferous). Since a form of calcium carbonate, usually limestone, is the predominant raw material, most plants are situated

## How concrete is made - material, manufacture, making, how to make, used 
To make it, the raw materials are crushed and ground into a fine powder and mixed together. Next, the material undergoes two heating steps—calcining and burning.  Other properties important for compliance include cement content, water/cement ratio, and workability, and standard test methods have been developed for these as well. The Future
