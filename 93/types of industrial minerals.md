## What are the two types of minerals? a. industrial and environmental b 
michell96. The correct answer is C. Metallic and nonmetallic. Explanation: Minerals are natural substances with defined properties. Moreover, minerals are essential for living beings and they compose rocks. Besides this, minerals are classified into two broad categories according to their composition: metallics and non-metallics.

There are more than 5,000 different types of minerals, according to Ed Raines, the collections manager for the Geology Museum of the Colorado School of Mines. Not to be confused with dietary supplements, the term minerals refers to metals and industrial resources mostly derived from mining. Discoveries of new ones are fairly commonplace.

## 6 Type of Clay Minerals and Their Characteristics
1. Kaolinite. Kaolinite is the most common type of clay. It can be easily found worldwide, extracted from rocks that are rich in kaolinite, later identified as kaolin clay.It mostly comes in white color as a result of the chemical weathering to the aluminum silicate (such as feldspar), creating a soft earthy mineral.. Kaolinite has triclinic symmetry and is electrostatically neutral.
