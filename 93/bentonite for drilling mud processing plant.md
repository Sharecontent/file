Bentonite extracts the drill cutting from around the bit which is then floated to the surface. Bentonite seals the drill hole against seepage and prevents wall cavities and leakages. Bentonite (Drilling mud) served to cool and lubricate the drill bit. Bentonite form slurry with leakages that is pumped through drill stem and out through drill bit.

## Thermoresponsive Bentonite for Water-Based Drilling Fluids
As an important industrial material, bentonite has been widely applied in water-based drilling fluids to create mud cakes to protect boreholes. However, the common mud cake is porous, and it is difficult to reduce the filtration of a drilling fluid at high temperature. Therefore, this paper endowed bentonite with a thermo response via the insertion of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) monomers.

Disposing of drilling fluid at landfill or state sites is costly. These costs vary significantly from place to place but can be in the order of $600 for every 1,000 gallons of drilling fluid. Haulage is another significant contributor to disposal cost. Dumping drilling mud at landfill sites far from the construction activity uses a lot of fuel.

## Drilling Deeper with Bentonite
If you are drilling with two hoses, turn the water off and then, QUICKLY: 1. Take the drill head off. 2. Pour the bentonite mix down the drillpipe. You'll probably need a big pitcher because it is hard to pour directly from the 5 gallon bucket. 3. Put the drill head back on and turn the water back on.

Bentonite is used in drilling mud to lubricate and cool the cutting tools ( drill bit ), to remove cuttings, to stabilize the borehole walls, and to help prevent blowouts (by maintaining a sufficient hydraulic pressure in the well). Bentonite also curtails drilling fluid invasion by its propensity for aiding in the formation of mud cake. [11]

A layer of hydrated bentonite provides a dense, low porosity barrier to fluid flow that exhibits a typical hydraulic conductivity of 1 x 10-9 cm/sec. The property of swelling makes sodium bentonite useful as a sealant, since it provides a self-sealing, low permeability barrier. It is used to line the base of landfills for example.
