## What's the Typical Purity of the Gold in Coins & Bullion? - First 
The purity of gold used in coins and bullion is defined as the percentage or number of "karats" of pure gold used in the finished product. Coins minted since 1800 contain at least 90 percent gold, and many well-known coins issued in recent years still only contain 90 percent pure gold, or 21.6k. These include British gold sovereigns and

## How to Test Gold Purity | Diamond Buzz
In this system, pure 24k gold is expressed as 1000 parts out of 1000. For example, to calculate 24k gold fineness, you need to divide 24k by 24 and multiply by 1000, which will give you a fineness of 1000. However, in practice, pure gold fineness is marked as 999.9 because there is likely to be a slight impurity in any gold.
