8.2.4 Construction Waste Management. Commercial construction typically generates between 2 pounds and 2.5 pounds of solid waste per square foot - the majority of which is recyclable. Salvaging and recycling construction and demolition waste can substantially reduce demand for virgin resources and the associated environmental impacts.

## Construction Wastes: Types, Causes, and Recycling Strategies
Construction waste is defined as fairly clean, heterogenous building materials which are produced from the various construction activities, as per Tchobanoglous et al., 1993. Construction, renovation and demolition activities lead to the formation of waste. The construction waste poses great danger to environment.

## The Effects of Construction Waste on the Environment: Best Recycling 
Recycle. Recycling is crucial in the effort to prevent valuable materials from ending up in the landfill, with the potential to turn 100 percent of non-hazardous waste back into new construction products. The key to successful recycling is to segregate waste as you go, using different skips or containers for different materials.
