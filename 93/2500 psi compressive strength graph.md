Although type S mortar must have a minimum compressive strength of 1,800 psi, it is often mixed for strengths between 2,300 and 3,000 psi.  While type M mortar provides at least 2,500 psi of compressive strength, it offers relatively poor adhesion and sealing properties, making it unsuitable for many exposed applications.

Concrete, by Mindness and Young, gives a general rule: The ratio of 28-day to seven-day strength lies between 1.3 and 1.7 and generally is less than 1.5, or the seven-day strength is normally between 60% to 75% of the 28-day strength and usually above 65%. The cylinder that broke at 1980 psi is 66% of the specified 3000 psi.

If you are using it on footings and walls, a concrete strength of 2,500 psi could be enough while between 4,000 to 5,000 psi is needed for pavements. Outdoor concrete used on home improvements should be ordered with a strength ranging from 3,500 to 4,500 psi.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete after 7 and 28 days
The compressive strength is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine. The compressive strength of concrete is calculated by the failure load  (MPa) in SI units. Concrete's compressive strength requirements can vary from 2500 psi (17 MPa) for residential concrete to 4000psi (28 MPa) and higher in

## 2500 psi compressive strength graph
For northern states, we must go with 4500 psi strength concrete. For southern states, the concrete will be designated as F0, which comes with 2500 psi minimum compressive strength concrete, no air-entrainment. For southern states, our previous standard of 3000 psi will still be specified. Designated Minimum Compressive Max Max. Read More
