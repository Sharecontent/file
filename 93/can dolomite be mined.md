## Where is dolomite used?f
Dolomite, also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide . It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater.

## Where is dolomite used?c.norushcharge
Dolomite, also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide . It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater.

## Dolomite (mineral)
Dolomite (/ ˈ d ɒ l. ə ˌ m aɪ t, ˈ d oʊ. l ə-/) is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg(CO 3) 2. The term is also used for a sedimentary carbonate rock composed mostly of the mineral dolomite. An alternative name sometimes used for the dolomitic rock type is dolostone.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
Dolomite also serves as an oil and gas reservoir rock. During the conversion of calcite to dolomite, a volume reduction occurs. This can produce pore spaces in the rock that can be filled with oil or natural gas that migrate in as they are released from other rock units. This makes the dolomite a reservoir rock and a target of oil and gas drilling.
