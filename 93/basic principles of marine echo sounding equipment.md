rpajarojaf1108. echo sounder, an older instrumentation system for indirectly determining ocean floor depth. Echo sounding is based on the principle that water is an excellent medium for the transmission of sound waves and that a sound pulse will bounce off a reflecting layer, returning to its source as an echo.

An echo is a reflection of an entire sound pulse, so the shorter the pulse, the less likely an echo will return during the pulse itself, and the less likely that early and late components of sequential pulses will interfere with each other. 3 Typically a B-mode ultrasound pulse is 2 to 3 cycles of sound energy in duration, and at 10 MHz, this

## Fisheries acoustics
Basic Theory. Biomass estimation is a method of detecting and quantifying fish and other marine organisms using sonar technology. An acoustic transducer emits a brief, focused pulse of sound into the water. If the sound encounters objects that are of different density than the surrounding medium, such as fish, they reflect some sound back toward the source.

Echo sounding is a way out measure the depth of water.This is done by sending out sound waves, and measuring how long it takes for the echo of the sound to come back. The speed of sound in the water is known, so the depth can be calculated. It is a kind of sonar.Note that the word sounding is used for all kinds of technologies, even though some do not use sound.

## How is sound used to measure water depth? - Discovery of Sound in the Sea
The invention of sonar changed the way that the seafloor is mapped. A combined transmitter and receiver, called a transducer, sends a sound pulse straight down into the water. The pulse moves down through the water and bounces off the ocean bottom. The transducer is able to pick up the reflected sound. Computers precisely measure the time it takes for the sound pulse to reach the bottom and

Basic principles of marine echo-sounding equipment. What is an Echo Sounder, its principle, errors and corrective action? Echo Sounder is a type of SONAR (originally an acronym for SOund Navigation And Ranging) used to determine the depth of water by transmitting sound pulses into water. The time interval between emission and return of a pulse is recorded, which is used to determine the depth
