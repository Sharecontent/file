## Factors Affecting the Efficiency of Rock Crusher Machine
Rock crusher machine is one of the important mechanical equipment in the mining machinery. The rock crusher machine is the effective equipment for the broken ore. Because the environment of the dressing equipment is harsh and the working time is long, so the damage to the crushing machine equipment will be great and lead to replace parts more frequently.

## Crushing & Screening Plant Design Factors - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Crushing & Screening Plant Design Factors. Crushing Plant Design and Layout ConsiderationsCrushing Circuit "A'' shows a small simple layout for use in mills up to 100 tons. In order to keep the flowsheet simple, and because of the use of the forced feed type of crusher, we can crush small tonnages up to 100 tons per day with a very simple

## Top Factors to Consider for Plant Design | Rock Crushing Plants
3. The Placement of the Primary Crusher. Primary crusher placement is another important aspect to consider during plant design. The closer the primary crusher can be to the pit area, the better. Reducing the haul distance from the pit area to the primary crusher will reduce the amount of mobile equipment needed, increase your production
