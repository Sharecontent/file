Depending upon the medium used for beneficiation of coal, the various processes are classified as WET or DRY. Those processes using water as medium are WET processes and are known as Washing Processes. The coal beneficiation plants using wet processes are named as Coal washeries. For raw coal fines of -0.5 mm, the difference in surface

##  Coal Beneficiation Technology - 2007 Initiatives, Policies and Practices
Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.
