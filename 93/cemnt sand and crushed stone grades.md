## Cement, Sand And Granite (concrete) Mix Explained - Nairaland
CEMENT - SAND - STONE relationship; In practice a 50kg of cement bag contains 2 head pan of cement; this means that if i have a plan to mix 1 bag of cement my mixing ratio would be: 1:2:4 = 1 bag of cement : 4 head-pans of sand : 8 head-pans of stone. 1:3:6 = 1 bag of cement : 6 head-pans of sand : 12 head-pans of stone.

After putting the value, we get (Volume of concrete x 1.54 x proportion of cement)/ (sum of proportions) i.e. (500 x 1.54 x 1)/7 = 110 cft. To convert it to bags, just divide it with 1.25 (the country's bag volume). 110/1.25 = 88 bags. In this way, you can make the other calculation.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.

Proper curing will prevent curling. Long after the first critical 28 days of curing, a layer of sand between the VB and concrete can act as a layer for water to hang out. After a long humid week, you may have a really nice dry day, and the water (in the form of vapor) that collected in the sand will drive through the concrete.

6. Crushed Stone Sand. Crushed stone sand is widely tipped as the natural successor of river sand. This type of sand usually contains no impurities, which makes it ideal for use in concrete. Crushed stone sand is a type of M-sand as it undergoes a thorough crushing process and testing before being released for construction work.

## Concrete Mix Design | Different Grades of Concrete - CIVIL READ
To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement, 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing.

Sand has a much higher capillary draw than gravel, and can seep into & fill perforated drain pipes, etc. Directing roof drains well away from the house is the first line of defense, but I personally wouldn't feel right about not having perimeter drain at the footing as well, even with sand that seems to drain well on it's own.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.
