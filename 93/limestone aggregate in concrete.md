Construction Aggregates. Vulcan is North America's leading producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel . We produce these materials from natural deposits such as granite, limestone and trap rock. Our quarrying process typically begins with drilling and blasting the rock into smaller pieces.

## Limestone Vs. Crushed Concrete | eHow
Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

The ratio of limestone as aggregate in the concrete in 1974 was only 1.3%. Since then, the shipments and the usage of limestone have increased every year with the demand of concrete and the shortage of other natural aggregates as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ratio of limestone as aggregate exceeded 8% in 2003. Download : Download full-size image

## The use of limestone aggregate in concrete
In building construction the aggregates commonly used are limestone and granite. Three quarters of concrete is made up from aggregate, thus the selection of aggregate should be in the prime condition. To produce a good, strength and high quality concrete the materials used should be in accordance to standard specification.

Limestone contains mineral components quartz, chert, clay, silt, calcite, and dolomite . Granite weighs approximately 2.65 to 2.76 grams per centimeter, cubed a little less dense than limestone. Its compressive strength, however, is higher than limestones as it is estimated to be 200MPa. The mineral components in granite are micas, biotite

The results showed that the shear strength of the limestone aggregate concrete beam was on an average approximately 24% less than that of the reference beam and it was only 57% of the ACI Code calculation at the minimum. The reduction was explained by the fracture properties of limestone aggregate concrete: small characteristic length with low
