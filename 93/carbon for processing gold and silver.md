## Gold and Silver Plating Basics | Products Finishing
An overview of precious metal electroplating processes. Gold and silver share a number of chemical and physical properties. Both are soft, malleable and ductile materials, with melting points of 1,065°C and 961°C, respectively. Both crystallize in face-centered cubic configurations and form stable alloys with each other in all proportions.

## Carbon For Processing Gold And Silver
Cyanidation process produces dissolved gold and silver. To get a loaded carbon or gold-bearing carbon in a carbonin-leach (CIL) process, the active carbon is included a in slurry and serves as the adsorbent for gold and silver. Later, the loaded carbon will release the metals, both and silver, gold through desorption process. Goldsilver in

## Gold recovery from loaded activated carbon using different solvents 
The adsorption of gold complexes (especially dicyanoaurat (I) ions) onto the activated carbon is the basis of modern techniques for gold extraction process. The process is very efficient and has been the major factor in improving the productivity of the gold mining industry over the last 25 years ( Bansal et al., 1988, Patric, 1995, Streat

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.

Stripping of gold and silver from carbon is effected by means of two main processes (AARL and ZADRA). The main rate-enhancing parameter in the stripping of gold and silver is temperature. A secondary rate-enhancing parameter is ionic strength.

Since the effect of structure on properties is identical for all carbon fibers, the characteristic properties of PAN-based and pitch-based carbon fibers reflect fundamental differences in their structures. The internal structures of these two varieties of carbon fibers are, in turn, a direct result of the processes used to produce them.

## Carbon in pulp
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.
