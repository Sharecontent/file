## Separation of Gold metal from Potassium Gold Cyanide salt
Dec 22, 2021Here's how I would do it: (1) Precipitate all the gold, silver, and copper with 325 mesh zinc dust. Since it is best to use a slight excess of zinc, there will also be some undissolved zinc mixed with the other metals. (2) Filter and rinse the solids very well in order to remove the cyanide solution.

You shouldn't try to run the alloy thru nitric, the karat, .790k, is too high. You should inquart with some silver and bring the karat down to about 6k, .250k, then the nitric will work dissolving the silver & zinc, thus leaving a gold sponge of about 98% to 99% purity. Then run the sponges thru AR for a higher purity.

The building blocks for a recovery are being laid. USD strengthening is failing to weigh precious metals down. Gold is building from support at $1760/$1765 but needs to do more for sustainable recovery. Silver is still consolidating around the mid-range pivot at $26 but improving momentum hints at a potential rebound.

## 5 Gold Extraction Methods to Improve Your Recovery Rate
Cyanidation: It is one of the main methods of gold extracting process. 1 Contact finely ground ore with the solution containing cyanide. 2 Separate solid from the clear solution. 3 Recover gold from the solution with zinc powder by precipitation. Video of cyanide gold process production line.

Abstract. Cyanidation has been used to extract gold (and silver) from ores, concentrates, and calcines since the 1890s. The precipitation of gold from cyanide solutions by zinc cementation was patented in 1884 and was applied industrially as early as the cyanidation process.
