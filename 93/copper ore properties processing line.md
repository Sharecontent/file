## Ore processing | Industrial Craft 2 Wiki | Fandom
Ore processing in IC² is a multi-stage process, requiring several machines in order to get the maximum possible yield from each individual ore. The best ore yield comes from a three-stage process. The first stage is a necessity; the second or third may optionally be skipped, but will reduce yield. Stage 1: Macerator Stage 2: Ore Washing Plant Stage 3: Thermal Centrifuge A Macerator processes

Adding foaming agent and inflate to produce bubbles, attach hydrophobic mineral particles to bubbles, and then float and separate. Floatation can usually deal with materials smaller than 0.2~0.3mm. In principle, it can separate all kinds of mineral raw materials, which is one of the most widely used methods.

## zinc processing | Britannica
zinc processing, the extraction of zinc from its ores and the preparation of zinc metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. Zinc (Zn) is a metallic element of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) crystal structure and a density of 7.13 grams per cubic centimetre. It has only moderate hardness and can be made ductile and easily worked at temperatures slightly above the ambient.

Copper ore processing. According to the metallurgy process, the copper ore is divided into three natural types by the ratio of copper oxide and copper sulfide. That is, sulfide ore, containing less than 10% copper oxide; oxidized ore, containing more than 30% copper oxide; mixed ore, containing 10% to 30% of copper oxide.

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

After the air is brought up through the water, bubbles form that float the water-repellent copper particles to the surface of the water. This separates out the froth which has 30% copper, 27% iron, and 33% sulfur. The flotation process gets rid of impurities in the ore, where there may also be lead and other vital metals in our society such as
