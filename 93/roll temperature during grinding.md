## Optimizing grinding and dressing with 'dressing speed ratio' parameter 
The dress speed ratio is the relationship between the dress roll velocity (V r ) in sfm or m/sec and the grinding wheel velocity (V s) in sfm or m/sec. and can be calculated using the following equation: Speed ratio = V r ÷ V s. The dress speed ratio can be a positive or a negative value as shown in Figure 5.

Grinding-induced heat could propagate and potentially injure surrounding nerves and arteries, and therefore, predicting the temperature in the grinding region would benefit neurosurgeons during the operation. High-speed electric motors are controlled by pulse-width-modulation (PWM) to alter the current input and thus maintain the rotational speed.
