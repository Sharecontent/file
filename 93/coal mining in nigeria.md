The coal found in Nigeria is said to be of very high quality. In the 1940s, mining and exportation of coal were major sources of foreign exchange in the country, but many mines were abandoned due to the Nigeria civil war. Mining of coal and other minerals like iron ore are still going on in the country though on a low key.
