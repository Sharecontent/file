## In-situ recovery: mining with minimal landscape disturbance
In-situ recovery, or ISR, is an approach to mineral extraction which combines drilling, rock fracturing and chemical leaching directly at the drill site, creating minimal surface disturbance of the landscape. Sometimes called in-situ leaching or solution mining, ISR initially involves drilling holes into the ore deposit.

## In Situ Leach Mining of Uranium - World Nuclear Association
In situ leaching (ISL), also known as solution mining, or in situ recovery (ISR) in North America, involves leaving the ore where it is in the ground, and recovering the minerals from it by dissolving them and pumping the pregnant solution to the surface where the minerals can be recovered.

## Infographic: Everything You Need to Know About In-Situ Mining
An Intro to In-Situ Mining. ISR is not a recent innovation in the mining sector. In fact, ISR has been used for the past 50 years in uranium mining, and 48% of the world's uranium gets mined this way. Uranium is not the only mineral it can extract; there is also silver, copper, and sometimes gold. ISR involves dissolving a mineral deposit in

In the early 1980s Magma initiated extensive tests to utilise the large tonnage of oxide mineralisation within the San Manuel cave zone overlying the sulphide ore body. The oxide ore body was located in the subsidence area and had been well fractured by the block-caving beneath. This was of great importance to the success of the in-situ leaching.

Taseko said it aims to produce 85 million pounds of copper annually, enough to make nearly 500,000 electric vehicles. In situ leaching does not require an openpit mine or a smelter. It also emits less carbon than most copper mines, according to ESG consultancy Skarn Associates. A two-year study by Taseko did not detect any leaks from test wells.

## Comparative Proteomics on Deep-Sea Amphipods after in Situ Copper 
The discovery of optimal biomarkers of deep-sea mining activities in deep-sea species is a crucial step toward the supply of important ecological information for environmental impact assessment. In this study, an in situ copper exposure experiment was performed on deep-sea scavenging amphipods.

## Does environmentally friendly copper mining exist?
However, BHP Billiton admits, "The water quality of the future lake is expected to be affected by spent process solutions that remain in the former open pit mine as a result of in situ mining on the benches. . . . the pit lake pH is expected to approach 5.0, and dissolved metals will still be present in the water."
