## Grinding Wheel Failures Can Lead To Serious Injury Or Death
Out of 27 accidents, 7 of them resulted in death as a result of the victim being struck by pieces of a disintegrating grinding wheel. In terms of grind wheel safety, there are several things to keep in mind.  Grinding wheels have a shelf life and you should use grinding wheels within two (2) years of their manufacture date.
