## Understanding the Benefits and Risks of Deionized (DI) Water
Two ion-exchange resins are used to deionize the water. Positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions) are exchanged for hydrogen (H+) and hydroxyl (OH-) ions, respectively, due to the resin's greater affinity for other ions. After passing through both types of resin at least once, all that's left is highly purified water.

Comparison of reverse osmosis and electrodialysis technology: Reverse osmosis (RO), also known as reverse osmosis, is mainly composed of a high-pressure pump and a reverse osmosis membrane. In the case of high enough pressure, except for water molecules, other minerals in the water, organic and various ions are almost rejected outside the membrane, and washed out by high pressure water flow.
