The Alberta government began its fraught push for coal nearly a year ago, when the province's United Conservative Party government announced it had done away with a 1976 policy that prevented open-pit coal mining in much of the Rocky Mountains. New mines in the region would produce metallurgical coal, used for steel-making. Backlash ensued.

## Clean Coal Technologies | Carbon Capture and Storage | CCS - World 
The term 'clean coal' is increasingly being used for supercritical coal-fired plants without CCS, on the basis that CO 2 emissions are less than for older plants, but are still much greater than for nuclear or renewables. Some 26% of primary energy needs are met by coal and 37% of electricity is generated from coal, compared with 23% for

Coal Mining Technologies. Surface mining of coal requires areas of land to be temporarily disturbed, which raises a number of environmental challenges. As coal mining is only a temporary use of land, a rehabilitation or reclamation plan is designed for each mine covering the period from the start of operations until well after mining has finished.

In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine. These pillars can be up to 40% of the total coal in the seam - although this coal can sometimes be recovered at a later stage.
