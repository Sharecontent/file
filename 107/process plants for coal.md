Dense Media Separation. A heavy medium is a heavy-fluid or heavy suspension fluid with a density greater than that of water (1g/cm3). The process of separating ore particles in heavy media is called Dense Media Separation / Heavy Media Separation (DMS / HMS). The heavy medium separation method is an advanced gravity beneficiation method.

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

## What Are The Main Components Of Coal - Realonomics
Coal is formed when dead plant matter submerged in swamp environments is subjected to the geological forces of heat and pressure over hundreds of millions of years. Over time the plant matter transforms from moist low-carbon peat to coal an energy- and carbon-dense black or brownish-black sedimentary rock.

Under the right conditions peat transforms into coal through a process called carbonization. Carbonization takes place under incredible heat and pressure. Which is the final stage of development of coal? A third phase in this coal development is bituminous (soft coal) which is one of the two stages used as a fuel in generating electrical power.

Coal is a non-renewable energy source formed by dead plants that have been compressed and heated. It all starts with the plants that lived 300 million years ago. The plants that died in swamps were covered in layers of water and dirt, compressing and heating the plants. Through this process the energy is trapped and forms coal.
