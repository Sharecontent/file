With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.

## Factors affecting proper coolant application when grinding
Bernoulli's energy equation can be used to predict the pressure that creates the desired jet velocity. For example, a grinding wheel moving at 12,000 sfm (3,657 m/min.) requires a nozzle pressure close to 270 psi (18.6 bar) for the coolant jet to match the wheel speed. Lower wheel speeds require lower pressures.

## How to use a Milling Machine - Instructions - American Machine Tools
The most common way to fasten the arbor in the milling machine spindle is to use a draw bar. The bar threads into the taper shank of the arbor to draw the taper into the spindle and hold it in place. Arbors secured in this manner are removed by backing out the draw bar and tapping the end of the bar to loosen the taper.
