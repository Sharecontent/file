## Environmental and health risks posed to children by artisanal gold 
Feb 9, 2022The global mining of gold among artisanal and small-scale mines is associated with numerous hazards. Traumatic and occupational hazards include mine collapse and cave-ins, crush injuries, burns, falls, barotrauma, drowning, asphyxiation, lacerations injuries from mining equipment, temperature-related maladies, and noise exposure. 1 -3 Chronic inhalational exposure to mine dust and

## Is mining gold bad for the environment?
They pose environmental, health, safety and economic problems to communities, the mining industry and governments in many countries, including Canada. The Ontario Mining Act describes "abandoned mines" as an old land previously used for coal mining but is now unused due to hazardous environmental and health effects.

The South African government is committed to controlling the hazards of mining. However, there are a number of issues concerning management of the hazards and risks in South African mines. Health and safety in mines in South Africa is regulated by the Mine Health and Safety Act 29 of 1996 and the Mine Health and Safety Act regulations.

## health hazards of gold mining
Health Effects Of Mining - TheWorldCounts. Every year, 1.8 million years of ill-health, disability or early death can be attributed to the global burden of disease from mercury poisoning in artisanal small-scale gold mining That's over 650 million days or 15 billion hours of healthy human life lost though small-scale gold mining make up only a tiny fraction of the global mining industry.

## The Dangers of Cyanide in Gold Mining - Peer Ledger
Jul 2, 2021Gold mining can be extremely dangerous and one of the most harmful practices is the use of cyanide to extract the precious metal from the rock. Fortunately, there are a range of innovators trying to eliminate this notorious poison from the mining process. Since the mid-1800s, cyanide has been considered a cheap and effective way to separate
