## Roll Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
4.2.3.1.1 Roll Mills. The roll mill is the simplest batch mixing equipment. The principal design consists of two horizontal rolls, usually of equal size, arranged side by side and rotating toward each other at different speeds. The ratio of the peripheral speeds of the rolls, known as friction ratio, ranges from 1 to 2 but is usually around 1.2.

In the rolling process, the job is drawn through a set of rolls due to interface friction, and the compressive forces reduce the thickness of the workpiece or change its cross-sectional area.. The types of rolls used in rolling mills are depended upon the shape, size, and the gap between the rolls and their contour.

## Mill Speed - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
13.1.1.2 Medium-speed mill. Medium-speed mills are smaller than low-speed units and are generally of the vertical spindle construction. The speed of the grinding section of these mills is usually 75-225 rpm. They operate on the principles of crushing and attrition. Pulverization takes place between two surfaces, one rolling on top of the other.

With the single-roller mills, brittle, soft to medium-hard materials can be reduced in size with a reduction ratio of approx. 1:5 to 1:5. The stepped arrangement of the crushing jaws on the crushing wall enables any material rolling off being minimised, so that, compared to the double-roller mill, coarser material can be drawn in.

Fig 4 Roll configurations in rolling mills. Two-high mill roll configuration - This is the most commonly used rolling mill configuration. In this configuration, there are two horizontally mounted rolls. The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece.
