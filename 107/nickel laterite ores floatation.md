Rainfall can cause large areas of cobalt mines to suddenly collapse. At least 80 artisanal miners died underground in the DRC between September 2014 and December 2015 alone, and the bodies of children and adults alike are often left buried in the rubble.  For example, cobalt does not fall under existing conflict minerals rules in the USA.

## Upgrading nickel in laterite ores by flotation - CORE
Nickel is sourced from sulphide and laterite ores. While 70% of the nickel resources are contained in laterites, these ores are often complex and expensive to treat using conventional methods.  Pre-concentration of laterite ores by flotation was found to be possible, but it is highly determined by the ore mineralogy. In this study, no or

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Genesis and types of nickel laterites. Lateritic nickel ores formed by intensive tropical weathering of olivine-rich ultramafic rocks such as dunite, peridotite and komatiite and their serpentinized derivatives, serpentinite which consist largely of the magnesium silicate serpentine and contains approx. 0.3% nickel. This initial nickel content is strongly enriched in the course of lateritization.
