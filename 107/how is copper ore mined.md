## What Is Copper Ore - Realonomics
Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils heat sinks and heat exchangers. Large amounts are also used to make alloys such as brass (copper and zinc) and bronze (copper tin and zinc). What ore does copper come from?

## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & Extraction
Copper minerals and ores are found in both igneous and sedimentary rocks. Mining of copper ores is carried out using one of two methods. Underground mining is achieved by sinking shafts to the appropriate levels and then driving horizontal tunnels, called adits, to reach the ore. Underground mining is, however, relatively expensive and is

## Copper - PUB2894 | Missouri Department of Natural Resources
In Missouri, copper is recovered from two primary ore minerals. Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) is found as massive mineralization, and also occurs as small distinctive crystals. Bornite (Cu 5 FeS 4) is most often found as massive material; crystals of bornite are rare. Both ores are currently are mined for copper in Missouri.

Copper Ore is a natural resource that is required to make Copper Ingots. It can be obtained in two ways: • Looting Vambies. • Extraction from a Cave in a forest biome (green areas on the Map) using a Mineral Extractor. This is the main and least labor-intensive way to obtain a large and steady supply of Copper Ore.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

2 days agoHow Copper is Mined. Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.
