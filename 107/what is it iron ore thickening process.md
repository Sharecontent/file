## Thickening | Sludge Processing
Thickening. Thickening processes are those which concentrate the sludge by removing part of the free water, i.e. the water not associated with the sludge particles or flocs. In doing so, the finished product retains the liquid, free-flowing characteristics of the feed sludge, so that it can still be conveyed by pumping.
