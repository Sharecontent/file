## Effective removal of calcium and magnesium sulfates from wastewater in 
Considering that the solubility product constant, K sp, of CaCO 3 (8.7 × 10 −9) is far less than that of MgCO 3 (2.6 × 10 −5), Ca 2+ is more easily precipitated than Mg 2+ in carbonate medium. 15 One study reported that the use of 12% ammonia water as the precipitant to remove Ca and Mg resulted in removal efficiencies of 75 and 52%, respectively. 16 Oxalic acid saponified with an alkali

## Removal of Aqueous Cu2+ by Amorphous Calcium Carbonate: Efficiency and 
Mar 16, 2022Crystalline calcium carbonate (CaCO3, such as calcite) could scavenge aqueous metals via adsorption and coprecipitation. As a precursor to crystalline CaCO3, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) is poorly understood on metals removal. Herein, we synthesized silica-stabilized ACC and investigated its Cu2+ removal efficiency and mechanism. The results showed that the Cu2+ removal efficiency by ACC

## removal of calcium caebonate from mining solutions
Fortunately, there is a simple and effective solution for calcium carbonate problems in mining operations. A Hydrosmart water softening solution uses an electromagnetic field to break the bonds in calcium carbonate, and so unblocks pipes downstream of the treatment site while also preventing rescaling.
