## Advantage And Disadvantage Of Dry Cement Production
What Are The Differences Between The Wet And Dry. What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement Manufacturer The main disadvantage of this method is that evaporating the water from the slurry uses a large amount of fuel This takes more time because the mix stays in the rotary kiln for two to three hours compared to 20 minutes with the more contemporary dry

## Cement kiln
A typical process of manufacture consists of three stages: grinding a mixture of limestone and clay or shale to make a fine "rawmix" (see Rawmill);; heating the rawmix to sintering temperature (up to 1450 Â°C) in a cement kiln;; grinding the resulting clinker to make cement (see Cement mill).; In the second stage, the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot

Bottle kilns were the first kilns used in the manufacturing process, where cement was burnt in batches. Following this, chamber kilns and subsequently continuous shaft kilns became popular. These kilns may be up to 200 metres long and six metres in diameter in wet process plants and much shorter in dry process plants. They consist of a steel

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
