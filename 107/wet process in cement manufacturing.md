## Advantage And Disadvantage Of Dry Cement Production
What Are The Differences Between The Wet And Dry. What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement Manufacturer The main disadvantage of this method is that evaporating the water from the slurry uses a large amount of fuel This takes more time because the mix stays in the rotary kiln for two to three hours compared to 20 minutes with the more contemporary dry

## Cement kiln
A typical process of manufacture consists of three stages: grinding a mixture of limestone and clay or shale to make a fine "rawmix" (see Rawmill);; heating the rawmix to sintering temperature (up to 1450 °C) in a cement kiln;; grinding the resulting clinker to make cement (see Cement mill).; In the second stage, the rawmix is fed into the kiln and gradually heated by contact with the hot

Bottle kilns were the first kilns used in the manufacturing process, where cement was burnt in batches. Following this, chamber kilns and subsequently continuous shaft kilns became popular. These kilns may be up to 200 metres long and six metres in diameter in wet process plants and much shorter in dry process plants. They consist of a steel

Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains. The cement is now ready for transport to ready-mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects. Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement, some kilns in the United States use a wet process.

The process is accordingly known as the dry process or the wet process of mixing. Dry process (modern technology) In this process, the raw materials are first reduced in size of about 25mm in crushers. A current of dry air is then passed over these dried materials.  Following is the procedure of manufacturing cement by dry process using

• Chalk is porous and often has high moisture content that leads it to its use in the 'semi-dry/wet' manufacturing process of making cement. This particular process represents some 16% of total production. Shale • Shale is a pure sedimentary rock made of very fine silt, clay and quarz. Shale falls in the category of mudstones.

The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.
