## How to clean cultured marble that has yellowed
Do not use an acidic cleaner to clean a cultured marble sink. It is best to use a cultured marble cleaner. Clean the sink periodically to avoid dense and stubborn stains. Seal the surface after cleaning to prevent restaining. Do not avoid sealing the surface after cleaning, as sealing only prevents further stains from occurring.
