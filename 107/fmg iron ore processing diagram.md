After reaching a new all-time high of more than $230 /dmt in May, iron ore prices held steady in the following months and traded in the $ /dmt range for most of June and July. However, things have changed dramatically in August and the price has now dropped to $140 /dmt, as assessed by CRU on 24 August.

## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation | ST Equipment & Technology
Iron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations, resulting in significant tailings generation. The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: mining, processing and pelletizing activities. Of these, processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.
