## Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation | ST Equipment & Technology
Iron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations, resulting in significant tailings generation. The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: mining, processing and pelletizing activities. Of these, processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.
