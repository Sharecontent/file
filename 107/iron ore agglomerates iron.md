## Review of organic binders for iron ore concentrate agglomeration
Low-grade iron ores are finely ground and processed to recover iron-bearing minerals. However, the iron-rich powder is too fine to be used directly in blast furnaces and most direct reduction furnaces, and must be agglomerated or pelletized into a usable product called "pellets." Bentonite clay has traditionally been used as a binder to make iron ore concentrate pellets, but it is

Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items. The equivalent of Iron Ore is Lead Ore, which will sometimes replace Iron in a world. Iron Ore

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Iron ore pellets are hard spheres made from powdered ore and binders. Pellets are used to make iron, mainly in blast furnaces. Around the time that the pelletizing process was developed, s tarch was proposed as a binder because it's viscous, adheres well to iron oxides, does not contaminate

## HIsarna ironmaking process
The HIsarna ironmaking process is a direct reduced iron process for iron making in which iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron ().The process combines two process units, the Cyclone Converter Furnace (CCF) for ore melting and pre-reduction and a Smelting Reduction Vessel (SRV) where the final reduction stage to liquid iron takes place.

## Heat Mass Balance In In Iron Ore Pellet Induration Furnace
Pellets are roughly spherical, thermally and or chemically bonded agglomerates with 10 to 16 mm in diameter. Modeling The Iron Ore Pellets Reduction On Shaft Furnace Iron ore pellet is an agglomeration improved heat exchanged. Pellets have high iron prior to induration with the help of an electronic mass balance (for accurate reading).
