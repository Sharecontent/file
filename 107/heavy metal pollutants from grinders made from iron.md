Modified nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is a promising functional material for the remediation of combined pollutants involving polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals. However, the interaction between the two types of pollutants has not been systematically studied for this method of treatment.

Arsenic. Arsenic is the most often known cause of heavy metal poisoning in humans. Arsenic is released into the environment through the refining of copper, zinc, and lead, as well as during the manufacture of chemicals and glassware. Drinking water contaminated with arsenic may harm your skin, liver, and eyes, as well as cause cancer.

Heavy metals, also known as trace metals, are one of the most persistent pollutants in wastewater. The discharge of high amounts of heavy metals into water bodies leads to several environmental and health impacts. The exposure of humans to heavy metals can occur through a variety of routes, which include inhalation as dust or fume, vapourisation and ingestion through food and drink.
