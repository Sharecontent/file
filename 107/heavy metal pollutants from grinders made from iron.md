The most toxic pollutants emitted are likely to be heavy metals, and highly toxic and persistent organochlorines such as the polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) (EC 1999). Henceforth, these compounds are referred to simply as dioxins and furans.

## Metals occuring in aquatic freshwater - Lenntech
How metals get into freshwater. Metals are introduced in aquatic systems as a result of the weathering of soils and rocks, from volcanic eruptions, and from a variety of human activities involving the mining, processing, or use of metals and/or substances that contain metal pollutants. The most common heavy metal pollutants are arsenic, cadmium

## Interaction between pollutants during the removal of polychlorinated 
Modified nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) is a promising functional material for the remediation of combined pollutants involving polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and heavy metals. However, the interaction between the two types of pollutants has not been systematically studied for this method of treatment.

Arsenic. Arsenic is the most often known cause of heavy metal poisoning in humans. Arsenic is released into the environment through the refining of copper, zinc, and lead, as well as during the manufacture of chemicals and glassware. Drinking water contaminated with arsenic may harm your skin, liver, and eyes, as well as cause cancer.

The heavy metals are those having densities five times greater than water, and the light metals, those having lesser densities. Well-known examples of heavy metallic elements are iron, lead, and copper. Examples of light metals are sodium, magnesium, and potassium. Humans consume metallic elements through both water and food.

Heavy metals, also known as trace metals, are one of the most persistent pollutants in wastewater. The discharge of high amounts of heavy metals into water bodies leads to several environmental and health impacts. The exposure of humans to heavy metals can occur through a variety of routes, which include inhalation as dust or fume, vapourisation and ingestion through food and drink.
