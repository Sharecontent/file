## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In Mineral Processing Design and Operations (Second Edition), 2016. 5.1 Introduction. Gyratory crushers were invented by Charles Brown in 1877 and developed by Gates around 1881 and were referred to as a Gates crusher [1].The smaller form is described as a cone crusher. The larger crushers are normally known as primary crushers as they are designed to receive run-on-mine (ROM) rocks directly
