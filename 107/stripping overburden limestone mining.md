Here are the types of surface mining that generate overburdens: Strip mining. Strip mining is a surface mining technique that removes thin layers of overburden in order to reach the mined ore. Overburdens in coal mining—strip mining is commonly used to extract coal near the surface of the earth, and it is a method that is used in the early
