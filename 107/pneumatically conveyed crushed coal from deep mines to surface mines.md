## Types of Surface Mining | American Mine Services
In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

If the mine has open storage piles, the crushed coal passes through a coal stacker onto the pile. The piles, usually worked by bulldozers, are subject to wind erosion. From the storage area, the coal is conveyed to a train loading facility and is put into rail cars. At a captive mine, coal will go from the storage pile to the power plant.
