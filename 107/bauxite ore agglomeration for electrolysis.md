## The Transformation of Bauxite to Aluminum (and the Products in Between)
An electrical current is run through the mixture, causing the carbon from the carbon anode to attach to the oxygen component in the alumina, yielding aluminum and carbon dioxide: 2 Al2O3 + 3 C > 4 Al + 3 CO2. This process takes place at temperatures between º C and yields an aluminum of high purity.

Firstly, aluminium has to be removed from the Earth, by mining. This is relatively simple, given the abundance of Aluminium. However, Aluminium is always bounded to other elements, and exists as compounds, often containing oxygen and silicon. Thus, it is impossible to obtain a pure substance of aluminium through mining. Aluminium's ore is bauxite.
