## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
Sep 23, 2021A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

## Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant - an overview - ScienceDirect
Coal is the dominating fuel source used in thermal power plants for generation of electricity. At the coal-fired thermal power plants, the raw coal is first pulverized to the shape of flour before it is force-fed to the furnace. During the pulverization process, the clay particles entrapped in the cracks of coal get separated from the coal.

Affordability. Energy produced from coal fired plants is cheaper and more affordable than other energy sources. Since coal is abundant, it is definitely cheap to produce power using this fuel. Moreover, it is not expensive to extract and mine from coal deposits. Consequently, its price remains low compared to other fuel and energy sources.
