## Lithium mining: What you should know about the contentious issue
There are always critical reports on the extraction of lithium from salars: In some areas, locals complain about increasing droughts, which for example threatens livestock farming or leads to vegetation drying out. From the point of view of experts, it is still unclear to what extent the drought is actually related to lithium mining.

Lithium mining accounts for less than 10% of freshwater usage and its brine extraction does not correlate with changes in either surface-water features or basin-water storage. Lithium, says David Boutt, professor of geosciences at UMass Amherst and one of the paper's co-authors, is a strange element. It's the lightest of the metals, but it
