Industrial Ceramics. Magnets are used in the manufacture of ceramics in order to remove metallic impurities. These impurities could reduce the quality of the finished ceramics, and it is important for companies to remove those impurities as part of the manufacturing process. The industry uses a variety of different magnetic technologies.

A process for upgrading low-grade magnetite-containing iron ore with minimum fine grinding. The dry ore is first comminuted to between about three-fourths inch and 10 mesh particle size and magnetically separated. The dry tailing is discarded and the concentrate is ground to between about 20 and 100 mesh and again subjected to dry magnetic separation.
