## How do we extract minerals? | U.S. Geological Survey
The primary methods used to extract minerals from the ground are: Underground mining. Surface (open pit) mining. Placer mining. The location and shape of the deposit, strength of the rock, ore grade, mining costs, and current market price of the commodity are some of the determining factors for selecting which mining method to use.

The final step in the extraction of zinc is the purification of the crude zinc obtained after the reduction process. The purification of crude zinc takes place by electrolytic refining. In the electrolytic refining of zinc, we have an electrolytic cell consisting of impure zinc as anode and a pure thin sheet of zinc as the cathode.

## What is Process Mining - RPA and Process Mining | UiPath
Process mining is a technique to analyze and track processes. In traditional business process management, it is done with process workshops and interviews, which results in an idealized picture of a process. Process mining, however, uses existing data available in corporate information systems and automatically displays the real process.

Surface Mining. Oil recovery in the oil sands uses two main methods: mining or in situ, depending on how deep the oil sands deposits are. Surface mining is used when oil sands deposits lie within 70 meters (200 feet) of the earth's surface. Twenty per cent of oil sands reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.
