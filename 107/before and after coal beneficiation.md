The coal being mined is of high vitrinite content and is commonly known as "hard coking coal". The value of coking coal is significantly higher than steam coal. It is therefore important to optimize the plant yield and recover the maximum percentage from coal mined at very high expenses due to difficult geological conditions.

The dry separation methods for coal beneficiation have been regaining attention in the past decades. A number of improved or newly designed devices have been developed—one of them is a negative pressure pneumatic separator (NPPS). The said method of separation is based on the differences in the physical properties between coal and gangue minerals, such as the grain density, size, and shape.

Mini blast furnaces (MBF) are generally viewed as miniature versions of the conventional large blast furnaces (BF). These furnaces are ideally suited for small scale operations. In fact, they are basically the forerunner to modern conventional last blast furnaces and hence they have operated for a longer period of time. Cupola furnaces were built in China as early as the Warring States period

Coal Beneficiation Coal beneficiation is a process by which the quality of raw coal is improved by either reducing the extraneous matter that gets extracted along with the mined coal or reducing the associated ash or both. Two basic processes of beneficiation: - Dry-deshaling: Non-coal or shaly-coal is removed without using any liquid media.
