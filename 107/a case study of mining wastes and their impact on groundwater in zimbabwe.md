## Mine Tailings Waste Leaching & Groundwater Contamination
The rapid release of acid and metals from mining wastes by natural leaching processes, therefore, presents a great potential for the contamination of groundwater. Groundwater is used extensively for public and rural drinking water supplies, agricultural water supplies and in some industries. Therefore, in recent years, an increasing number of

## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and
