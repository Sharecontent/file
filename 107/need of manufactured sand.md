## 7 Types of Sand Used in Construction - BuilderSpace
The main aim of manufactured sand is to provide an ecological and economical alternative to natural sand. Quarry stones and rocks are usually blasted and consequently subjected to several crushing cycles to reduce the particle sizes of the resulting sand. The sand obtained from blasting and crushing quarry stones is then sieved and washed.
