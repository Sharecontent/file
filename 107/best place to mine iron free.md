## What is the actual best place to mine iron? : r/Minecraft
Thanks! y 64 probably does have the most iron because no other ores spawn except coal but y 64 is above sea level so you might end up mining into the surface and then there will be no iron ore, if you mine in a mountain biome it will all be stone so that would probably work very well or just go to y = 12 since then you get lots of iron as well
