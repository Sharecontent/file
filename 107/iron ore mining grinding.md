## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

Mining of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a type of mineral and rock from which metallic iron is extracted economically. This ore is normally rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow and deep purple to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite

## Iron ore pelletizing - Metso Outotec
Iron Ore Pellets are formed from beneficiated or run of mine iron fines. The iron is usually ground to a very fine level and mixed with limestone or dolomite as a fluxing agent and bentonite or organic binders as a binding agent. If the ore is a Hematite ore, coke or anthracite coal can be added to the mix to work as an internal fuel to help

## How Is The Iron Ore Mined? - FTM Machinery
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel producers. Natural iron ore is gradually selected from iron by means of crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, re-election, etc. Iron ore is a mineral aggregate that can be economically utilized with iron or iron compounds. Any ore containing iron that can be used economically is
