## Preparation and Properties of Lime Concrete
Since long, Lime has been used to make things like plaster and mortar. Lime is usually made by burning of limestone. Chemically; lime itself is calcium oxide (CaO) and is made by roasting calcite (CaCO3) to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2). Lime is also called calx or quicklime. Quick Lime is very caustic and can even dissolve human bodies.

Quicklime is also referred to as handpicked lime, burnt lime, lump lime, calcining lime, and caustic lime. It is known to be a caustic material that is prepared at approximately 900 degrees Celsius by burning calcium carbonate limestone, carbon dioxide is forced off at this high temperature, and the limestone is converted to Quicklime.

The fineness of the white fine limes can be set within wide limits (0.06 to 0.1 mm). In downstream Pfeiffer lime hydrators, water is added to quicklime, thus transforming it into lime hydrate. White fine lime is used for the production of limestone bricks and aerated concrete. Lime hydrate is used for the production of plaster and mortar.

Limestone is a great building material that is strong and durable. It is cut into bricks and blocks. There are several differences between the two, including the size. Limestone bricks Bricks are the smaller of the two and are coursed so they can be used just like normal bricks . They have a 10mm joints, while blocks are cut to allow 20mm joins.
