We prepared enough equipment for three operations. Alluvial relates to alluvium, we speak of clay or silt or gravel carried by rushing streams and deposited where the stream slows down. Alluvial deposits are most common in gold mining, especially in small scale gold mining. It took about 8 hours to load the truck with all the equipment.

When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

Fill it up about halfway and then place the rock in the water (assuming it's small enough to do so). You can measure how big the rock is by how much water is displaced. If the water line moves up 3/4 of a cup then that's how big the rock is. You can use Google to convert that volume to cubic centimeters.
