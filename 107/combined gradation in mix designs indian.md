## Gradation and Size - Pavement Interactive
Refers to a gradation that contains only a small percentage of aggregate particles in the mid-size range. The curve is flat in the mid-size range. Some PCC mix designs use gap graded aggregate to provide a more economical mix since less sand can be used for a given workability. HMA gap graded mixes can be prone to segregation during placement.

In Concrete mix design, crucial part is taking proportion of aggregates. How one can know the mix is under sanded or over sanded or may have voids in it etc. To analyze this we do check the gradation of aggregates according to relevant standard for conformity. Course Aggregates are single size aggregates like 20 mm, 10mm - We require to verify

2. Determine the combined gradation of the HMA mixture based on proposed proportions of RAP and virgin aggregate to be used in accordance with section F.1.b. 3. Calculate batch weights for each ingredient in the mixture using the provided batching sheet. 1Note : When using RAP in HMA mix designs, the aggregate gradations and total
