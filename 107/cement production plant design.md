## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Cement plants, given their large-scale industrial thermal energy demand, offer opportunities for co-generation of electricity and/or steam production, particularly if the co-generation system is part of the initial plant design. This could significantly improve the overall energy efficiency of some manufacturing operations.

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Abstract. Cement production is an energy-intensive process. The cost of energy constitutes more than 60% of the cost of the cement; hence cement plants have to consider minimizing the cost of energy when planning production. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the production plan.

## How Cement Is Made
Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden. Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients. Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone, shells, and chalk or marl combined with
