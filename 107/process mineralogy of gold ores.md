There are 3000 various types of Minerals and based on their composition, they can be classified into metallic and non-metallic minerals. Metallic minerals contain metal in the raw form. Metals are hard substances that conduct heat and electricity and have a characteristic lustre or shine. Iron ore, bauxite, manganese ore are some examples..

## Process Mineralogy - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gold ores: Basically when a gravity process is able to recover more than 50% of gold,  Gold-Copper Ore Mineral liberation. There are some gold deposits with variable degree of oxidation, but basically the ore can be classified in two categories, oxidized and non-oxidized. Then, both composites must be studied in order to assess their
