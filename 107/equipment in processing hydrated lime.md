## HYDRATED LIME | Chemical | Carmeuse
Hydrated lime is often used for its calcium and magnesium value in either a final product or by-product. It is also used for dry or slaked hydrated lime production to be further used later in a process. These processes can include alkali source, pH adjustment, as an accelerant, or a metathesis reaction amongst others. Introduction.

Hydrated lime is the second most important product of the lime industry and modern industrial applications developed in the 20 th century require many different qualities of lime, to be manufactured under strictly controlled conditions. In particular relatively new industrial uses, such as FGD, have required new product characteristics, from enhanced average fineness, to higher surface area

## Pelletized Lime vs. Ag Lime (and Other Imposters)
The powdered lime is ground to a very fine consistency, allowing the product to dissolve quickly and start working fast. Equipment such as a disc pelletizer is used to form the powder into a granule, with binders such as lignosulfonates assisting in the process. There can be much product variation even within the category of pelletized lime.

Slaking - the process of introducing just enough water to quicklime to convert it from a highly alkali oxide to a less reactive hydroxide. Hydrated - lime that has been slaked. Hydraulic - lime that has a clinker of reactive silica compounds that will set with water. Non-Hydraulic - lime that sets only by reabsorbing CO2 from the air.
