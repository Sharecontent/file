##  Optimized crusher selection for the cement industry
Primary crushing of limestone for the cement production requires high crushing ratios to reduce the run of mine material in one step down to the required grain size distribu-tion (approx. 0 - 25/80mm) for the raw material mills.  Double Shaft Hammer Crushers are used in the cement industry to solve crushing problems in difficult materials
