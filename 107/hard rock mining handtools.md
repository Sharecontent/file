About Hardrock Mines. These are primarily ores and metals (e.g. gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel). Most are small to medium in size, though there are a handful of large, significant sites. These sites are predominately in the West, which gave rise to the establishment of cities and towns during homesteading (Westward population expansion).

## What is hardrock mining? - Short-Facts
What was the difference between Placer mining and hard rock mining? Generally as the placers would slowly become exhausted, miners would begin tracing the source of the gold and begin developing hard rock mines. These mines were more labor-intensive than placer mining, but if a rich gold vein was located they could be exceptionally rich to work.
