At the cathode, catalysts split N 2 molecules and prompt the hydrogen ions and electrons to react with nitrogen and make ammonia.At present, the yields are modest. At room temperature and pressure, the fuel cell reactions generally have efficiencies of between 1% and 15%, and the throughput is a trickle.
