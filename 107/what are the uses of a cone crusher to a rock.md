## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
Purpose of Crushers. A crusher is a machine designed to reduce the size of large rocks to smaller rocks, gravel, sand, or rock dust; this is essential for efficient transport of the product via conveyors etc. Crushing is the first of many stages that lead to separation of the mineral (s) from the waste (gangue) material.

Gyratory Crushers Gyratory crushers are similar in shape and operation to cone crushers. However, their moving crushing components gyrate (i.e., oscillate along a circular path) rather than rotate. The crushing head can be height-adjusted, and the hole at the bottom of the crushing chamber determines the final size of the crushed material.

While cone crushers are usually supported at the base, gyratory crushers are suspended. Impact crushers, sometimes called "hammer crushers," use mass and velocity to break up pieces with a blow bar or hammer that strikes a stationary plate. When the rock hits the plate or anvil, it breaks on natural stress lines to create a uniform product.
