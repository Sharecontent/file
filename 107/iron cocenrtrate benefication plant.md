## crushing and screening iron ore concentrate
Process Description2-5,41 Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron-bearing particles, concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material (gangue), and pelletizing the iron ore concentrate. A simplified flow diagram of these processing steps is shown in Figure -1.

## Beneficiation
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream ().There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step furthering the concentration of the original ore.
