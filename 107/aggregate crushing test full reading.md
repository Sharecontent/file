## Test on Aggregates, lab tests, fine aggregate test, coarse aggregate 
Aggregate Water Absorption Test. Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate. Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength, impact and hardness tests. Water absorption shall not be more than 2% per unit by weight.

Aggregate suitable for use as pipe bedding would display a low compaction fraction, indicating it reaches a state of near full compaction under loose placement. Test Method: Crushing Value: The Aggregate Crushing Value offers a related measure of the resistance of an average to crushing under a compressive load that is gradually applied.
