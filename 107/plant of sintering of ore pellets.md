## Raw materials - Sinter plant | ArcelorMittal
The sinter plant turns iron ore into sinter, which is the optimal product for the blast furnace. Sinter is made by burning a mix of iron ore powder, fluxes and recycled substances from the steel plant to create an open-grained, consistent substance. The sinter is then crushed, cooled and screened for dust. Sometimes, iron ore is supplied in the form of iron ore pellets.

What is the difference between pellets and sinter? The typical iron (Fe) content of sinter is around 55-58%, while BF pellets are normally 62-66% Fe. BF pellets have a higher Fe content as they are manufactured from low- grade ores that are finely ground prior to undergoing mineral beneficiation treatments.

##  Sintering and Pelletisation of Indian Iron Ores
8 mm. HPS feed consists of iron ore as pellet feed fines, return fines and iron and steel work remnants, filter dust, additives and binders like limestone, dolomite, bentonite and coal dust. These micro pellets are fed onto a sinter machine to produce sinter cake, which is then broken down and smelted in a blast furnace.
