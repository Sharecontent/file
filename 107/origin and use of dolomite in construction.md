## Origin And Use Of Dolomite In Construction
Dolomite is a double carbonate of calium and magnesium, CaCO 3, MgCO 3. It is of sedimentary origin and is supposed to have been formed due to chemical action of sea-water containing high percentage of magnesia, on limestone. Theoretically, dolomite contains: CaCO 3 - 54.35% MgCO 3 - 45.65% In other words, it contains: CaO - 30.4% MgO - 21.7%

Dolomite (rock). Dolomite (also known as dolomite rock, dolostone or dolomitic rock) is a sedimentary carbonate rock that contains a high percentage of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.It occurs widely, often in association with limestone and evaporites, though it is less abundant than limestone and rare in Cenozoic rock beds (beds less than about 65 million years in age).

How is dolomite prepared? Abstract. Synthetic dolomite has been formed by precipitation from a solution of MgCl 2, CaCl 2, and urea subjected to elevated temperatures and CO 2 pressures. The CO 2 pressure is not critical above two or three atmospheres but the temperature must be in the range 200° C-250° C. to obtain dolomite.

Raw dolomite is used in the size range of 4 mm to 8 mm. The second major use of dolomite is in steelmaking. In steelmaking dolomite is used both as a fluxing material and also as a refractory material. For use in steelmaking, the SiO2 (because of its acidic nature) content in the dolomite is to be very low preferably less than 1 %.
