## Coal Production and Utilization Trends in Nigeria
Coal utilization in Nigeria could be traced to the nineteenth century, its first discovery was not until around 1909. Nigerian coals, which are mainly found in four major deposits, are low rank, (that is, mainly lignite and sub-bituminous) and are of cretacious or early tertiary age.
