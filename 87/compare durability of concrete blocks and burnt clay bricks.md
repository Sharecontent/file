Bricks are to be categorized into many types which depend on their M aking processes, Quality, the raw material is going to use and also their using purpose But mainly we can categorize the brick into six main types and then subtypes. Burnt Clay Bricks. Concrete Bricks. Fly Ash Bricks. Fire Bricks.

## Clay Bricks Vs Concrete Bricks - What Is the Difference?
Clay tends to retain color and structural appeal much longer than cement. CMU's physical properties also explain why its absorption rate is different from brick. CMU is a very porous material and will absorb water at much higher rates than brick. If you are using brick for decorative purposes, then concrete may be your better option.

Per ASTM C90, concrete blocks and bricks must have a minimum of 1900psi. In general, amongst the various types of blocks, the average concrete block can withstand roughly 3500 psi. As for an average clay (red) brick, these units can withstand up to 3000 psi. In this research, solid brick was used, and the gross strength on it was roughly 2.15MPa.

16. Fly Ash Brick. This brick gets its name because it is manufactured using fly ash and water. Fly ash is a by-product when burnt coal is mixed with water. These bricks contain a high level of calcium oxide, a property used in cement production, therefore creating a self-cementing brick.

## Bricks vs solid concrete blocks: which is better?
Concrete blocks have a much higher water resistance than bricks, and their compressive strength is higher. Concrete has a shorter life than brick, though it still gives efficient results for up to 100 years. It is also incredible durable and can be painted more easily than brick, which secretes metallic salts that can cause paint to peel off.

Burnt Clay Block. The most popular types of bricks used in construction are clay bricks. These are generally referred to as common brick. Burnt clay brick is molded from clay and then mostly dried in the sunlight and fired in a kiln. These types of bricks are further categorized by first class, second class, third class, and over burnt clay

By comparison, the average 8-inch concrete block has an R-value of 0.08 per square inch - or 2.5 for the entire block. Adding insulation to concrete blocks increases R-value by around 1.2 per square inch, while air-entrained blocks can reach R-values as high as 3.9.

May 30, 2022Site trials carried out in 2019 showed that concrete bricks are around 30% slower to lay. A 30% slower lay-rate is equivalent to an extra 8 working days for an average house . Concrete bricks can lead to a higher-than-expected overall cost, and longer construction time for your project. Clay bricks are durable, sustainable, and reusable.

## Types of Bricks Used for Construction in Pakistan | Zameen Blog
Concrete Bricks. If you are wondering what is the strongest type of brick, then concrete brick may be the answer you're looking for. After burnt clay brick, concrete bricks are the first-class bricks in terms of durability. They are made from solid concrete and are among the most common types of construction materials in Pakistan.

## The Three Common Types Of Bricks - Hicks Asphalt, Paving, and Concrete
Concrete bricks are bricks that are, no surprise, made from concrete. Concrete is a mixture of fine cement, sand, gravel, and water. The benefit of concrete bricks is that is do not absorb water and therefore are said to be almost waterproof. The downside of concrete bricks is that they typically have a shorter lifespan than burnt clay bricks.

Strength: The average compressive strengths typically range from 3,000 to 4,000 psi. Moisture Absorption: Concrete bricks absorb between 40 to 80 grams of moister per minute per square inch. Color Availability: Concrete bricks are not color fast and they will fade over time. Shelf life: Shelf life is less than clay brick.

## Clay Bricks vs Concrete Bricks - What is the Difference?
When it comes to brick shape, concrete is a much more versatile product. Concrete brick comes in a myriad of shapes - from squares and triangles to octagons and trapezoids. Clay, on the other hand, is typically limited to more traditional shapes such as rectangles. Concrete can also be stamped or textured to provide unique visual appeal.

## Clay Brick vs Concrete | Claytile
Clay bricks rarely exhibit movements in excess of 1mm per 10 metres of walling. Because concrete is more porous, cement bricks exhibit reversible expansion and contraction in the range of 3-6mm per 10m of walling. Clay bricks have a once off, permanent expansion after manufacture due to the firing process that extracts all moisture from the brick.

## Burnt Clay Bricks Versus Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Blocks
Durability and Life span. AAC blocks are superior to bricks on parameter of Durability and Life span; AAC blocks reduce operating cost by 30-40% [8]. It Reduces overall construction costs by 2.5% as compared to burnt clay bricks, as it requires less jointing. and reduces need for cement and steel.
