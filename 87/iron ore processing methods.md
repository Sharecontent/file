When the content of sulfur and phosphorus in iron ore is high, the pig iron is brittle, and the mineral processing process to reduce the content of sulfur and phosphorus is necessary. Iron concentrate used in magnetic materials is sometimes required to contain less than 0.4% silicon. Such super concentrate must be mineral processed.
