## How are gold coins made? The coin minting process - BullionByPost
Coins are made by mints, and the whole coin manufacturing process is called minting. Gold and silver bullion coins will generally be just a small part of a range of coins that a mint manufactures. The largest part of the mint's production will be base metal coins for monetary circulation. Though gold was at one time regularly used in

Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

Casting is a manufacturing process in which a solid is dissolved into a liquid, heated to appropriate temperature (sometimes processed to change its chemical formula), and is then added into a mold or cavity. Thus, in just one step, complex or simple shapes can be crafted from any kind of metal that has the capability to be melted.
