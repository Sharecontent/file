## The Working Principle and Structure of Rod Mill
In this post, we're going to learn more about rod mill. We'll cover it from two aspects: 1. Working principle. 2. Structure. Let's dive right in! 1. Working Principle of Rod Mill. Rod mill is a common equipment for grinding operation in mineral concentrator, which is mainly suitable for rough grinding operation.

## Working Principle Of Bead Mill - ELE Mechanical
The energy for dispersion and grinding is transmitted to the grinding beads by the agitator. the agitator is driven by spindle and the original energy is powered by the torque of main motor. Therefore,when main motor started,the beads would grind material in the form of extrusion,impact,shearing,friction,etc.
