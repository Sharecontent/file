• Iron ore reduction with hydrogen. Direct reduction of iron ore to a low carbon product for use in steel manufacture is already practised. Reduction normally takes place in natural gas or a coal derived reducing gas containing CO, CO2 and H2. Direct reduced iron (DRI) has been developed as a low-cost high-quality alternative to scrap steel.

The ingredients to make useable iron were limestone, ironstone, coke and air. The coke is the fuel and the ironstone provides the iron ore. Ironstone is first roasted in calcining kilns, located next to the blast furnaces, to remove impurities. The air, or blast, was blown into the blast furnace by powerful steam engines.

You as mistaken. Elemental iron and cast-iron are two very different things. Cast-iron contains a higher percentage of carbon than high-carbon steel. High-carbon steel is like %.95 tops, while cast iron is greater than 2%. The carbon present in cast iron, among other benefits, prevents the iron from rapidly oxidizing when exposed to the atmosphere.

## Cast Iron: Properties, Processing and Applications - Matmatch
Cast iron is an iron alloy containing 2 wt.% - 4 wt.% carbon, 1 wt.% - 3 wt.% silicon and smaller amounts of minor elements [1]. In comparison, steel has a lower carbon content of up to 2 wt.% and a lower silicon content. Cast iron can also be further optimized by alloying with small quantities of manganese, molybdenum, cerium, nickel, copper, vanadium and titanium before being cast.
