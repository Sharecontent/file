When mathematically calculating the actual angle of the pile, however, you are comparing it to a 90-degree angle (base to slope). With that, the first step in determining the angle of repose mathematically is to measure the sample pile from the base of the pile to the topmost part.

The main application of the angle of repose is to assess the flowability of a granular material (powder, pellets). The flowability of a bulk solids is estimated by 1 st measuring the angle of repose, then referring to the angle of repose table below to determine in which class is the powder studied : Flowability expected.

Angle of Friction is the angle between the normal force (N) and the resultant force (R) of normal force and friction, whereas Angle of Repose is the angle of maximum slope, where an object placed just begins to slide. In other words we can say that it is that maximum angle where a body or object can be tilted from the horizontal without falling

## gold ore angle of repose
Angle of repose. The angle of repose, or critical angle of repose, of a granular material is the steepest angle of descent or dip relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°.

The angle of repose (θ) is calculated from the equation arc cos[D/(l 1 + l 2)]. The relationship between flow properties and angle of repose has been established. When the angle of repose is less than 25 degrees, the flow is said to be excellent; on the other hand, if the angle of repose is more than 40 degrees, the flow is considered to be poor.
