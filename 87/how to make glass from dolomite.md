Dolomite's unique 3D pore junction is the core feature of these microfluidic chips. The 3D pore is an opening in the channel: droplets emerging from the pore do not contact any part of the glass channel walls. This helps to give chips a long life and allows easy cleaning when working with sticky polymers such as PLGA.
