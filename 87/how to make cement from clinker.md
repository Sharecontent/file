## Process for making low alkali cement clinker - Google Patents
The potential K 2 O content of cement clinker due to the presence of potassium compounds in the raw feed mix is substantially eliminated by introducing an active agent into the kiln along with or in conjunction with the fuel used to fire the kiln. The active agent is effective to convert K 2 O to KCl and preferably is a chlorinated organic waste product burned along with the fuel.

## The cement kiln - Understanding Cement
It is clearly helpful, therefore, if the clinker is cool as it enters the mill. From an environmental and a cost viewpoint, the cooler reduces energy consumption by extracting heat from the clinker, enabling it to be used to heat the raw materials. From a cement performance viewpoint, faster cooling of the clinker enhances silicate reactivity.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.
