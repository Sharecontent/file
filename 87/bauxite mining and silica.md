A process for removing silica from bauxite is disclosed. The method includes the step of mixing bauxite with a caustic liquor to form a mixture and to dissolve and stabilise at least a substantial part of the reactive silica from the bauxite. The caustic liquor is selected to have a high caustic concentration and a high alumina content.

Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.

 The silica present in the bauxite tends to be concen-trated in the finer grained fractions, and this charac-teristic makes bauxite amenable to beneficiation by screening techniques. Pearson' has reported that in a bauxite of average composition of 1.58% silica, the minus 100 mesh fraction analysed a silica content as high as 10.30%.

Jul 2, 2021Bauxite recoveries in modern washing plants is in the range of 60-80%, however, in some of the plants, the recovery is found to be as low as 50%, as they use simple vibrating screens in place of hydro-cyclones. The quality of input bauxite, particularly silica content and targeted washed bauxite quality, dictate the washed ore recovery.

Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

Bauxite ore contains sufficiently high levels of aluminium oxides and suitably low levels of iron oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and silica (SiO 2) to be economically mineable. The amount of reactive silica is particularly important as this form of silica consumes the caustic soda needed to make alumina, thus low reactive silica is desirable.
