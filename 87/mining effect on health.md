## Uranium mining and health - The College of Family Physicians of Canada
Uranium mining is the first step in the generation of both nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Nuclear power plants produce routine radioactive emissions in air and water, produce nuclear waste, and create conditions for disasters similar to Chernobyl and Fukushima. Physicians should be concerned about the health effects of the uranium continuum.

## Impact of Mining On The Environment
The impact of mining is leading to the major issues, like a threat to the entire environment and also damaging the health of all life on Earth. Mining procedures generally require a larger and vast area of land. Deforestation is a by-product of mining and the build up of the mining areas requires constructing roads and residences for the mine employees and often vegetation farms are abolished.
