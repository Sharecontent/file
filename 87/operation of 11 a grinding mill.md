Traditionally, the millstone rotates by waterpower. At Gray's Mill, a Sluice Gate was used to start and stop the flow of water from the mill pond across the road. The Sluice Gate was opened by a turning Sluice Wheel, which starts the flow of water, causing the water wheel to turn, thus providing power to grind the grain.

The mill discharge from these mills consists of slurry, which goes to the ball mills for further grinding, and coarse pebbles/rocks, which are crushed and sent back to the mill. To maximize the capacity of these circuits, the general practice is to use grates with pebble ports (reaching 100 mm) instead of normal grate openings to increase the
