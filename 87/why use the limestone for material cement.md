## Sustainability and limestone waste - LSI Stone
In the construction area, it is often necessary to use other materials to flatten the surface of the place where the construction will be carried out. It is usual to add different layers to the ground, being limestone waste one of them. This option is cheaper and equally effective as any other, and certainly the most sustainable one.

## Why Use Lime? - Building Limes Forum
3. The Use Of Lime Has Ecological Benefits. Lime has less embodied energy than cement. Free lime absorbs carbon dioxide in the setting process of carbonation. It is possible to produce lime on a small scale. The gentle binding properties of lime enable full re-use of other materials. A very low proportion of quicklime will stabilize clay soils.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

## Is Limestone a Good Building Material?
Limestone Has Dependability. Limestone is one of the most durable options out of all building materials. It's strong and dense, and contains few pores. Less pores make it harder for the stone to break, and allow it to withstand abrasion and freeze-thaw. It's also weather resistant, making it the perfect option no matter the climate you're in.
