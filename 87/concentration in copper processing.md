## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

discovered that heat made copper more malle-able. Casting and smelting of copper began around B.C. (see figure 6-2). About 2500 B. C., copper was combined with tin to make bronze—an alloy that allowed stronger weapons and tools. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, probably was not developed until 300 A.D.

Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.

## Hydrogen Peroxide in Reagent Regimes in Copper Sulphide Ore Flotation 
When a long-term aeration is replaced by treatment with hydrogen peroxide, the degree of copper concentration for M-TF decreases from 9.5 to 2.7, for butyl xanthate—from 5.1 to 1.5.
