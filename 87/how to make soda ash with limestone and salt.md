## Why does Soda Ash cloud up pool water? - Orenda Tech
Conclusion. Soda ash clouds water because it creates a sudden LSI violation (over +0.30), which forces calcium carbonate to fall out of solution. It happens in two ways simultaneously: the high pH of soda ash converts bicarbonates into carbonates, and soda ash itself is sodium carbonate, which introduces new carbonates.

Today, natural Soda Ash is only produced in Wyoming, USA and Turkey. 2. Synthetic Soda Ash production: By synthetic production methods using either the so-called Solvay or Hou processes, in which salt (sodium chloride) is reacted with either limestone or ammonia to produce synthetic Soda Ash. This accounts for about 67% of global production.

Slaked lime is used to remove calcium bicarbonate from water. In the water to be treated, the slaked lime ions react with the calcium bicarbonate to form the very slightly soluble calcium carbonate. This precipitated material is usually removed by first settling and then filtering. Ca (OH) 2 + Ca (HC0 3) 2 --> 2 CaCO 3 + 2 H 2 O.

## What Is Caustic Soda and Where Can You Get It? - ThoughtCo
Updated on February 03, 2020. Caustic soda is one of the common names for sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is also known as lye. Its common name derives from its chemical identity as a sodium hydrate and because it is caustic or corrosive. In pure form, caustic soda is a waxy, white solid. It readily absorbs water and forms aqueous solutions.
