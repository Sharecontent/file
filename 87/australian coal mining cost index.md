Each year, the Australian mining industry is estimated to produce 57 Mt (Million tonnes) CO 2-e or almost 11 per cent of Australia's total 2020 emissions. Of this total, about 44 Mt comes from coal mining alone [7]. The bulk of coal emissions come from fugitive emissions from underground and open cut coal mining, as shown in the chart below.

## Coal | Geoscience Australia
Mining. In Australia, nearly 80% of coal is produced from open-cut mines, in contrast to the rest of the world where open-cut mining only accounts for 40% of coal production. Open-cut mining is possible because coal seams are close to the surface. Such mining is cheaper than underground mining and enables up to 90% recovery of the resource.
