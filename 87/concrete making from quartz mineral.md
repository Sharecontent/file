Silica.We've determined that one paver cut releases 45 million micrograms of dust into the air. But not all of that dust is silica.Our tests have shown an average silica content in masonry materials of +/- 20%. If 20% of that dust is silica, we can calculate silica by weight: 45,000,000  20% = 9,000,000 micrograms.

## Mineral Admixtures used in Concrete and Their Importance
In general, all mineral admixtures reduce bleeding of concrete. Admixtures with finer particle size and higher specific surface area are suitable for preparing high density and low permeability concrete. Increase in water demand due to addition of admixtures may be handled by the use of an effective superplasticizer.

## Quartz Countertop Stain
Quartz countertop stains occur due to a chemical reaction with the resins used to make the countertop. A cleaner, chemical, food or drink discolors the resin. The "stain" is usually a lighter white spot that appears bleached out (similar to marble etching) Nothing absorbs. "Non-porosity" has nothing to do with it.

Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.
