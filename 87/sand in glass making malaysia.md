The following is the process for making flat glass, which is commonly produced with silica sand. Batched - The main components, including the silica sand, limestone, soda, and recycled glass, are weighed and sorted into batches. Melted - The batched raw materials enter a furnace that reaches temperatures up to 1600°C and become molten.

Brilliantly colored and imaginative glass forms, like these by Chihuly, derive from mineral additives blended into melted sand. Such compounds help impart color to the glass, make it easier to melt, and give it better structural properties. But the "middle-sized" grains, like quartz, get rolled, bounced, and sometimes picked up by the wind.
