## What is zinc and how does it affect your industrial process water and 
What is zinc and where does it come from? Zinc is a naturally-occurring heavy metal that is abundant in the earth's crust, and present in comparatively smaller quantities in soil and in surface waters. In its pure elemental form, zinc is a bluish-white metal with a lustrous appearance.  Most zinc comes from metal ore deposits that are

Cadmium, a rare but widely dispersed element, is found naturally in the environment. Most cadmium ore (greenockite): occurs in association with zinc. It is released into the environment through mining and smelting, its use in various industrial processes, and enters the food chain from uptake by plants from contaminated soil or water.

## why does ore come from zinc
Lead and zinc ore is mined almost exclusively in underground operations, though a few surface operations do exist. Zinc - Health Professional Fact Sheet When zinc deficiency does occur, it is usually due to inadequate zinc intake or absorption, increased losses of zinc from the body, or increased requirements for zinc [29,30,37].

## Zinc Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A. Mohamad Ghazi, James R. Millette, in Environmental Forensics, 1964. 4.3.2 Mining and Production of Lead. Lead and zinc ores often occur together, and there are a large number of countries that mine and process lead ore, making it among the most widespread metals in terms of primary production (Kesler, 1994).Most of lead mining is done by highly mechanized underground methods, although some

## Zinc - Element information, properties and uses | Periodic Table
Zinc is found in several ores, the principal ones being zinc blende (zinc sulfide) and calamine (zinc silicate). The principal mining areas are in China, Australia and Peru. Commercially, zinc is obtained from its ores by concentrating and roasting the ore, then reducing it to zinc by heating with carbon or by electrolysis.
