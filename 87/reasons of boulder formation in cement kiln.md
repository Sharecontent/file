## Common Rotary Kiln Processing Challenges - FEECO International Inc.
Ring formation is extremely common, occurring in roughly 85% of commercial rotary kilns. It is typically the result of a change in slagging temperature. The slagging temperature is the point at which the material will fuse together, allowing it to solidify. If a change in feed composition that reduces the slagging temperature is allowed to

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) reading: The CO2 level in the flue gas provides an indication of the efficiency of the combustion process. If the production of CO2 is as high as possible with slight excess air (complete combustion), the flue gas heat losses are at their lowest. The CO2 reading is calculated from the O2 reading by the analyzer.
