Silver is found in lead, zinc, gold and copper ore deposits. The most important ore mineral of silver is argentite (Ag2S, silver sulfide). Silver is commonly extracted from ore by smelting or chemical leaching. Uses. Silver has been used for thousands of years for jewelry and decorative items of all types. Likewise, it has been used for silverware.

It has a distinct silver color and a bright metallic luster. Galena tarnishes to a dull gray. Because lead is a primary element in galena, the mineral has a high specific gravity (7.4 to 7.6) that is immediately noticed when picking up even small pieces. Galena is soft with a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and produces a gray to black streak.

## Smelting Process, History, Base metals, Environmental and occupational 
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore, to extract a base metal. It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores, including silver, iron, copper, and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore, driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.

The most important ore mineral of silver is argentite (Ag2S, silver sulfide). Silver is commonly extracted from ore by smelting or chemical leaching.  How do you extract silver from galena ore?

The railroad reached Galena in 1855, marking the end of the steamboat era. Lead production began to decline by 1848 due to depletion of ore reserves and the exodus of many miners for the California Gold Rush. The early miners followed the surface diggings downward with conventional drilling and blasting mining methods.

The primary ore is galena or Lead sulphite PbS. This is unstable, and on prolonged exposure to the atmosphere it oxidizes into the minerals cerussite PbCO3 and anglesite PbSO4. Lead ores are usually associated with other metals, particularly silver which can be mined at the same time - and zinc, which can cause problems during smelting.

How It Works. The present method for smelting lead sulfide concentrates to produce lead is a pyrometallurgical smelting method that requires temperatures as high as 1,400 °C. Such smelting methods result in high lead and sulfur dioxide emissions. These high-temperature smelting operations will be unable to meet proposed emission standards.
