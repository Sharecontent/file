## Ancient Mining Tools and Techniques - Owlcation
Jul 23, 2022In Northern and Northeastern Europe, bogs were the site of bog iron, the earliest form of iron used for tools. Iron compounds from plant decay precipitate out and are deposited at the bog bottom. These nuggets of iron were harvested and smelted to produce mining tools of wrought iron. Some people harvest iron in this manner to this day.
