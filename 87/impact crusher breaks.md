## Impact Crusher Parts - Wear Parts For Industry | Qiming Casting
What are the impact crusher parts? Impact crusher is a kind of crushing machine that uses impact energy to crush materials. When the machine works, the rotor rotates at a high speed driven by the electric motor, and the material enters the plate hammer area, then crushes with the plate hammer on the rotor, and then is thrown to the impact device to crush again, and then bounces back to the

## Impact Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
An impact crusher breaks the CDW materials by striking them with a high-speed rotating impact, which imparts a shearing force on the debris (Figure 4.4(b)). Upon reaching the rotor, the debris is caught by steel teeth or hard blades attached to the rotor. These hurl the materials against the breaker plate, smashing them into smaller particle sizes.
