## Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

Assume the test specimen is of 28 days old and max compression load at which the specimen starts breaking is 165KN. As per above fig, Surface are is 50Sq.cm = 5000mm 2. 1 KN = 1000N = 165 x 1000 = 165000. As per formula, Compressive strength of cement = 165000/5000 = 33N/mm2. Hence, the Grade of cement is 33 Grade.
