## What Is Copper Ore - Realonomics
The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ~50% copper. What is copper ore used for? Most copper mined today is used to conduct electricity - mostly as wiring. It is also an excellent conductor of heat and is used in cooking utensils heat sinks and heat exchangers.

The decreasing concentration of copper in ores now requires pre-treatment of ores.  The process of liberation of copper ores depends upon whether they are oxide or sulfide ores. Subsequent steps depend on the nature of the ore containing the copper and what will be extracted. For oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical liberation process is
