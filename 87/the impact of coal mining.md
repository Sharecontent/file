Impacts of coal mining are visible by landscapes that lack the beauty of a mountainous backdrop and landscapes that are void of any trees or plants. These areas are left barren by the excavating of the earth in order to reveal the coal hidden underneath (Theilmann, 2015). In conjunction with the impact on the environment, various health issues

Mining can often be devastating — causing water acidification, soil erosion and the degradation of local ecosystems. While some methods have less impact than others, it almost always has a serious and lasting environmental impact. Fortunately, there is some hope that mining will become more sustainable in the future.

Coal Mining. Health effects from coal mining include: the release of methane (CH 4), a potent greenhouse gas estimated to account for 18% of the overall global warming effect triggered by human activities (CO 2 is estimated to contribute 50%).; the release of carbon monoxide (CO) from explosives, which pollutes the air and poses a health risk for mine workers.
