## Gypsum - White Sands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)
Gypsum is a hydrous, soft sulfate mineral, specifically a calcium sulfate dihydrate, which means it has two molecules of water in its chemical composition. This is seen in its chemical formula is CaSO 4 2H 2 0. When gypsum is heated and the water within the mineral is evaporated out, gypsum turns into a chalk or plaster, known as plaster of Paris.

##  Gypsum Wallboard Chemical Additives
Gypsum, unlike cement, is a physical structure rather than a chemical structure. The needle-like gypsum crystals form a network to give the board its physical integrity The crystals are closely interwoven, giving the core most of its wet strength. After drying, the frictional forces of these crystals increase the strength of the core.

The former may further be segregated into wide and narrow gypsophiles, depending on the breadth of their distribution area. Narrow gypsum endemics have a putative similar chemical composition to plants non-exclusive to gypsum (i.e. gypsovags), which may indicate their similar ecological strategy as stress-tolerant plant refugees on gypsum

## What is the chemical formula of Gypsum? - Chemistry Q&A - BYJU'S
The chemical formula of gypsum is CaSO 4.2H 2 O. Explanation. Gypsum mineral is non-toxic, and it is a very common sulfate. Gypsum is chemically known as calcium sulfate dihydrate. It consists of water, calcium sulfate attached to oxygen. Gypsum is a soft white or grey-coloured naturally occurring mineral made up of hydrated calcium sulphate.
