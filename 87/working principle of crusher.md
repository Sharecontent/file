## Cone Crusher | Working Principle | Animation | Engineering Intro
Cone crusher and gyratory crusher work on the same principle. Both have the same operation. If cone crusher differs then it is only from crushing chamber. Cone crusher has a less steep crushing chamber and more parallel zone between crushing zones. It breaks the rocks by squeezing it between the gyrating spindles.

A jaw crusher crushes only a small proportion of the original aggregate particles but an impact crusher crushes mortar and aggregate particles alike and thus generates a higher amount of fine material (O'Mahony, 1990).

## Working Principle of Crusher
Crusher. Industrial crushers crush or deform materials through impact or pressure, thereby reducing large pieces of rock, ore, or waste to a smaller size. During the primary crushing operation, the boulder size feed is reduced from 20 to 100 inches to the secondary crusher size of 1 to 20 inches or the ground feed size of 0.5 to 3 inches.
