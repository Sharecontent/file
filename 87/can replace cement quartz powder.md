##  Experimental Investigation on High Performance Concrete With Partial 
study is to determine strength properties of concrete with quartz powder as partial replacement of cement. The five variant concrete mixture were made by partially replacing quartz powder (up to 30%) to cement and added super plaster (0.8%). The mix proportion adopted was 1:1.35:0.29:0.8. Compressive and flexural strength test was

## Block of Quartz - Minecraft Wiki
A block of quartz is a mineral block used for decoration. It can be turned into a chiseled quartz block, quartz pillar or quartz bricks. Blocks of quartz can be mined using any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it drops nothing. Four quartz blocks generate naturally as part of each bridge bastion remnant. Master-level mason villagers sell both a quartz block for an emerald and a quartz

## can replace cement quartz powdera
(2017) carried out a study on concrete by partial replacement of glass powder and quartz Powder in cement with Steel Fiber. In their study the replacement of 5% Quartz Powder and also Glass powder in cement by 22%, 25%, 30% in additional of 1% steel fiber increases the compressive strength of the concrete .

## Can Replace Cement Quartz Powder
EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION ON HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE WITH study is to determine strength properties of concrete with quartz powder as partial replacement of cement. The five variant concrete mixture were made by partially replacing quartz powder up to 30% to cement and added super plaster 0.8% . The mix proportion adopted was 1:1.35:0.29:0.8.
