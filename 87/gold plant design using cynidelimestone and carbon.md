## Gold Processing Plant | Multotec
Using a CIP gold processing plant, pulp flows through tanks where sodium cyanide and oxygen help dissolve gold into solution. CIP plants are similar to Carbon-in-leach plants. Carbon-in-leach (CIL) is a process of cyanidation similar to that of CIP. The difference is that in a CIL plant, carbon is added to the leach tanks so that leaching and

The well-known carbon-in-pulp (CIP) and carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold recovery processes are fairly robust. Considering the constantly changing characteristics of run-of-mine (ROM) ore, a robust process is in general a great advantage for a mineral processing plant. The disadvantage, however, is that because less input is required from operators and

## Estimating process design gold extraction, leach residence time and 
Plant design parameters for gold extraction, leach residence time and cyanide consumption are generally determined from standard bench-scale bottle roll or agitation leach tests. The application of laboratory data to process design has essentially evolved from the testing of oxide or low cyanide-consuming ores. Such scale-up factors may not be appropriate for ores that deplete cyanide and

## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation - FEECO International Inc.
The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore, allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit, some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.

## Carbon in pulp
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.. Introduced in the early 1980s, Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process. As such it is used in most industrial applications where the presence of competing silver or copper does not prohibit its use.

## gold plant design using cynide limestone and carbon
The test work on side by side gold loading comparison, of different manufacturers carbons has shown two carbons, type A and E, are far superior in total ultimate loading and the rate of gold adsorption. Pilot and commercial plant experience in the operation of carbon column and CIP gold adsorption processes suggests that various factors inhibit

A calculated carbon dose of between 4 to 6 g of Haycarb YAO carbon per batch of leached solids was used for the test. The carbon amount was based on an expected carbon gold loading through three CIP cycles to around 1500 times the pregnant solution tenor. (1) The carbon charge was added to the first batch of leach slurry and continuously agitated.
