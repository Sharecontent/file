The connection between energy use and food has always existed and always will. Since time immemorial to the present, we have expended one form of energy or another to hunt, gather, sow, and harvest our foodstuffs. In the current era, the mechanized farm machinery we are familiar with could not function without oil-derived fuels and lubricants.

The processing and production process of lead-zinc ore mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is a more modern method suitable for the crushing of high-hardness lead-zinc ore, which can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation

## Five flotation methods, help you processing lead-zinc oxide ores
The principle is to sulfide the lead-zinc oxide ore in advance. The lead-zinc oxide ore surface is covered with a sulfide film with strong hydrophobicity, and then a xanthate collector is used to activate it under the action of copper sulfate to carry out flotation separation. Among them, sodium sulfide is a common vulcanizing agent.

## Present Situation on Beneficiation of Lead-Zinc Oxide Ore
With the exhausting of lead-zinc sulphide ores, the recovery of lead-zinc oxide ores becomes more and more significant. Extensive work has been carried out at home and abroad on the treatment of lead and zinc oxide ores in reagent scheme, flotation flowsheets, and joint process. Sliming is one of the main reasons why the lead-zinc oxides are difficult to recover.

## A review of zinc oxide mineral beneficiation using flotation method 
Usually, the zinc oxide ores have a complex gangue composition and, therefore, selection of depressants is dictated by the gangue composition present in the ore. Carboxylic acid is applicable to smithsonite separation from silica or clay minerals [23], but calcareous material such as calcite or dolomite will float during smithsonite flotation

## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
Improper blast design and implementation can result in uncontrolled movement as shown in the Figure 7. If such blasts contain both ore and waste rock, it can lead to significant ore loss and dilution. In operations where the dilution is a critical issue, blasts are usually designed to minimise any lateral movement of the ore.

## present situation on beneficiation of lead zinc oxide ore
Present Situation on Beneficiation of LeadZinc Oxide Ore . With the exhausting of lead-zinc sulphide ores, the recovery of leadzinc oxide ores becomes more and more significant Extensive work has been carried out at home and abroad on the treatment of lead and zinc oxide ores in reagent scheme, flotation flowsheets, and joint process Sliming is one of the main reasons why the leadzinc oxides
