Fine ground masa is typically used for soft table tortillas, while a slightly coarser grind may be used to give tamales a heartier texture, or for making a slightly thicker tortilla to be used for totopos (chips) and tostadas.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
