Apr 20, 2011 Â· Coal Classification.  It is measure of how well coal can be stockpiled for long periods of time without crumbling to pieces. Modern power plants normally stockpile 60 to 90 days' supply of coal in a large pile near the power plant. The coal unloaded from wagon is packed in a long trapezoidal pile.

The ROC Curve and the ROC AUC score are important tools to evaluate binary classification models. In summary they show us the separability of the classes by all possible thresholds, or in other words, how well the model is classifying each class. Thus the area under the curve ranges from 1, corresponding to perfect discrimination, to 0.5.

## coal - Coal types | Britannica
Coal types Macerals. Coals contain both organic and inorganic phases. The latter consist either of minerals such as quartz and clays that may have been brought in by flowing water (or wind activity) or of minerals such as pyrite and marcasite that formed in place (authigenic). Some formed in living plant tissues, and others formed later during peat formation or coalification.

Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants bituminous coal subbituminous coal or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam which drives a turbine which produces electricity.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.
