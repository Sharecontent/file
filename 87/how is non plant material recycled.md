4.1.1 Raw materials. The CP concept of raw materials substitution implies effective and efficient use of raw materials (to minimize losses along the process system) as well as using different raw materials that will not generate waste during processing. This concept also further implies re-using materials or using recycled materials.

## Sustainable Recycling Plants and Why They Matter - ERI
A look at the general recycling process reveals a number of conditions that could easily squander resources. Trucks used to pick up collectible recycling materials use gas and emit carbon. The sorting process consumes electricity derived from fossil fuels. Large water supplies may be necessary in order to process recycled material.

But plastic poses a particular problem. Of the 29 million tons of plastic waste collected in the EU in 2018, less than a third was recycled. About a quarter went into landfills, and about 43 percent was burned in incineration plants.

Bioplastics vs. biodegradable plastics. Biodegradable plastics are often confused with bioplastics, but the two are very different. Biodegradable refers to plastics made from treated petrochemicals. Bioplastic refers to plastics made from renewable feedstocks, such as wood, corn, soy, sugar cane, and grasses. Bioplastics are often compostable.

Often mixed-up, bio-based and recyclable resins are two different classes of materials. Biobased means that the raw materials are sourced from a non-fossil origin. In almost all cases, a part of the raw material chemicals are sourced from plants. Often a percentage of biobased content is given. Recycling means that the material can be used again.

Watch on. Recycling is a process where you take items made of a specific material, break it down, and reuse it in some way. The metal can that you rinsed you gets sorted and crushed with thousands of other cans to be processed, melted, and reused. Together, they get melted down and turned into new cans. Paper gets turned into new paper products.
