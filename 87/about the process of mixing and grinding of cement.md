## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form

## What goes in first in a concrete mixer?
The process of mixing concrete is fairly simple. The first ingredient that goes in is water, followed by cement and sand. The order of ingredients should be kept in mind when using a concrete mixer. Concrete mixers are typically used for mixing and pouring concrete into forms or for mixing and pouring mortar for bricklaying and plastering.
