The artificial sand is the sand and stone material crushed by sand making machine and other professional sand making equipment, it has the characteristics of sharp angle and rough edges compared with the natural river sand. The river sand is dug directly from the river, so it is mixed with small pebbles and fine sand.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids. Well-shaped natural sands are ideal for workability of mixtures.
