In processing our local ore with the MBMM jaw crusher, hammer mill and shaker table, we get a p80 of ~30-50 mesh (80% passing 30 or 50 mesh sieve screen), depending upon the slot size in the hammer mill screen. Results show nearly 50% of the gold recovered was at <100 mesh, and a surprising amount of gold was at <325 mesh.

Sep 24, 2019 · Material with a size smaller than 0.1mm in alluvial gold mine generally does not contain the gold concentrates. Gold ore with a size smaller than 0.1mm is generally named floating gold and it is difficult to be recycled during the extracting process. For the ore slime with same size grade, it can threaten the normal dressing work.

1. Magnetite ore stage grinding-magnetic separation process The stage grinding-magnetic separation process mainly utilizes the characteristics of magnetite that can be enriched under coarse grinding conditions, and at the same time, it can discharge the characteristics of single gangue, reducing the amount of grinding in the next stage.

## 5 Gold Extraction Methods to Improve Your Recovery Rate
For placer gold ore with specific gravity ≥1.25, the process can minimize the gold particle size to 0.04mm. Can process coarse metal minerals with .007mm-50mm in size. For placer gold processing with specific gravity difference ≥1.25 and ore monomer dissociation, the minimum particle size can reach 0.04mm.
