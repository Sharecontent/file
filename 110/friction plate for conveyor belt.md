## Conveyor belt behavior is influenced by friction - Martin Eng
The fundamental rule of conveyor belt tracking is that the belt will move toward the side that has more friction, or the side that reaches the friction first. Friction between the belt and, generally, the rollers serves to slow down the movement of the belt. If this friction is distributed unevenly across the belt, one side will slow down while

## Fabric conveyor belt essentials | Guide for engineers
Oct 27, 2020When installing a conveyor belt, it is important to use sufficient pre-tension. If the pre-tension is too low, you lose grip on the drive after the fabric has been relaxed and it may slip. For a conveyor belt with PET fabric, the pre-tension at installation is at least 0.3% (0.5% for PA fabric), which is usually sufficient for correct operation.

## 2.3.1 Coefficient of Friction
The tension ( T) in a horizontal conveyor, like that in Figure 2.22, is basically calculated by this formula: T = M1 × g × f1 × 1.1 + M1 × g × f2 + M2 × g × f3. Where: T = total chain tension. M1 = weight of the chain, etc. M2 = weight of conveyed objects. f1 = coefficient of friction when chain, etc., are returning.
