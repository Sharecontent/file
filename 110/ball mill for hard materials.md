## How to Hard-Mill Effectively | MoldMaking Technology
Use strong, precise toolholders. High-precision holders are crucial when hard milling to achieve maximum tool life. Run-out must be limited to less than .0004-inch to maximize tool life. Machinists can achieve this level of precision with most shrink-fit holders, milling chucks, high-precision collet chucks and select end-mill holders.
