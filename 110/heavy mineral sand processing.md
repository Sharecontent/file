Some heavy mineral sands producers closed operations at low-grade ilmenite deposits to concentrate on deposits with higher zircon content or those more readily amenable to beneficiation. Ilmenite reserves have, however, increased 125% over the last 15 years from 25.1 Mt in 2002 to 56.5 Mt in 2016, after recovering from a post global financial

As the sand face is undermined it collapses into the pond forming a slurry, which is sucked up and pumped to a floating concentrator. At this point, the heavy minerals are separated from the sand by exploiting differences in mineral density via a multi-stage circuit of sluices.1

## The coastal heavy mineral sand deposits of Africa
The formation of an economically viable deposit requires the juxtaposition of most, if not all of these conditions to favour heavy mineral concentration with a high VHM content. Mining is by open cast using either dry mechanized, hydraulic monitoring, or floating dredge and wet concentrator methodologies.

In Brazil, heavy mineral sand deposits are still barely exploited, despite some references to Brazilian reserves and ilmenite concentrate production. The goal of this project is to characterize and investigate the potential recovery of heavy minerals from selected Brazilian placer occurrences. Two areas of the coastal region were chosen, in Piaui state and in Bahia Provinces.
