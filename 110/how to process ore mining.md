## Rough Diamond Ore Processing
Several techniques are used to process the diamantiferous ore. The techniques used will not be the same between artisanal and industrial mining, however there are some common elements: Crushing, not too fine (rough diamond must not be crushed). Screening separates the sand from large elements. Washing disaggregates muds from ore.

## 9 Step Process for Discovering, Mining & Refining Gold - Provident Metals
Step #6 - Mining samples and determining processing. Once mining gets underway, samples must be taken to determine the precise metallurgical qualities of the ore. This is done in order to determine the appropriate processing technique. Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done.

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

The Mining Process. 1. Mining - Open Pit and Underground — To define the ore from the waste rock, samples are taken and assayed. Assay results are used to mark out areas of ore and waste rock, which are mined separately. Some of the harder areas require blasting to loosen the rock prior to excavation by hydraulic diggers.

## What comes first when conducting a mining operation?
What is the process of mining minerals? The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock to remove the desired mineral ore. The ore is then crushed into finely ground tailings for chemical processing and separation to extract the target minerals.  Each component of a drilling fluid has a different chemical function.
