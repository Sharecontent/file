## effect of silica in iron ore beneficiation
Mineralogy and textural impact on beneficiation of goethitic ore. Iron ore is the basic raw material used for iron and steel making. The principal impurities associated with iron ores are silica, alumina, sulphur and phosphorous. The high grade hematite iron ores require simple crushing and washing.

## beneficiation of Low grade iron ore fines - Blogger
These ores subject to beneficiation yield a concentrate containing 61.5 to 66% Fe at 62 to 86% yield. In case of BHQ ore, column flotation technique has been adopted to obtain a concentrate of 66% Fe at 44.7% yield. It has been observed that beneficiation of low grade ores invariably pose specific challenge due to the presence of clayey/earthy
