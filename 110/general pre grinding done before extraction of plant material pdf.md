## Pre Grinding vs Post Grinding Systems - Halverson
DISADVANTAGES OF PRE-GRINDING. Pre-grinding may not be the best choice for your facility if you don't have a lot of storage space and materials. When grinding up your ingredients the day or night before, you will need to store them in large containers until they are ready to be mixed. This will increase your storage and real estate costs.

## Optimization of cannabis extraction yield by controlled milling
The fast-growing field of cannabis extraction still holds many process inefficiencies, that can be easily overcome. A bottleneck often encountered is the packing density, or lack thereof, of cannabis plant material in the extraction vessel. Low packing density leads to a decrease in extraction efficiency and increase in output variability.
