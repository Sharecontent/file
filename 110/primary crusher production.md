## Primary Crusher
Generally, the cone crusher is used in crushing a variety of high hardness stone, such as river pebbles, granite, diabase and so on. In the mining industry, a jaw crusher or a rotary crusher usually acts as a primary crusher, and the cone crusher performs secondary crushing of the crushed material. In the production of artificial sand, if.

## Primary Crusher Selection & Design - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Dependability and long service life are landmarks of good primary crusher design of up to 30 yrs. The selection of the primary crusher must consider best-in-breed maintenance services as the whole mine's production goes through 1 or 2 of these machines and make the in-pit crusher a vital piece of equipment. Ultimately, the mining sequence
