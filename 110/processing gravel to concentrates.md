## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill

## Suspension and infiltration of copper concentrate in a gravel bed: a 
This paper shows the advances of an experimental study of the spill of copper concentrate into immobile gravel beds. The purposes of this research are to identify the dynamics of the copper concentrate as it spills in gravel bed rivers due to mining pipeline accidents, and to quantify loads of transport in suspension and bed infiltration experimentally. The sedimentation process is generated

Gold can be freed from these ores or concentrates by treating them with various oxidizing processes. The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.
