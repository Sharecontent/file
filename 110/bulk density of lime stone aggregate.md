## Density of Aggregate - Bulk and Relative Density - Civil Engineering
If the volume is unit then, Bulk Density= Mass. Unit in kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3. In this definition, the volume is that contains both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles. The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal-weight concrete is between kg/m3 (75-110 lb/ft3) .

## Mass, Weight, Density or Specific Gravity of Bulk Materials
As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft. Note, kg/cu.m divided by 16.02 = lbs/cu.ft.

The bulk density of biomass materials is highly variable. The denser common materials are PKE and pellets of olive and wood. These materials have a bulk density of kg m − 3, which can be compared to a typical bulk density of hard coals in the region of 1000 kg m − 3.
