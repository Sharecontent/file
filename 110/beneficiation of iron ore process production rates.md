## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

## processing of ore beneficiation
There are usually three stages in iron ore production: mining, using a blast and removal technique, processing, and pelletizing, which turns ore into pellets the size of marbles. Processing increases the iron content while reducing the gangue in ore minerals, ensuring the correct grade and chemistry are achieved prior to the pelletization process.
