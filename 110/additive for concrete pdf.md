##  Human Hair Fibre Reinforced Concrete - IJERT
Experiments were conducted on concrete specimens with various percentages of human hair fibre i.e. 0%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5% and 2% by weight of cement. Researchers found that there is an increment in the various properties and strength of concrete which makes it a suitable additive for concrete to enhance its mechanical properties.
