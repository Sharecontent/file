Cement production also results in the release of a significant amount of solid waste materials and gaseous emissions. In addition, of the cement production marble quarrying and processing evolves a huge amount of wastage. During marble processing, 30% of the stone (in case of unprocessed stone) goes to scrap because of being in smaller size and/or irregular shape.

## Production of marble slabs in the Roman imperial period
They discovered that the material loss during marble slab production at the time was likely lower than it is today. The researchers examined, photographed, and measured 54 restored slabs of Cipollino Verde, each measuring around 1.3 square meters, which had been used to decorate the walls of a villa in ancient Ephesus on the west coast of Turkey.

## Less Waste During Production of Marble Slabs in Ancient  - SciTechDaily
Finally, with the help of the software, the researchers created a three-dimensional model of the marble block, which in turn enabled them to draw conclusions about the material wastage during the production of the slabs. "The slabs are about 16 millimeters thick and the gaps between them, caused by sawing and subsequent polishing, are about 8
