Historically, India has always been a net exporter of iron ore, with exports reaching a peak of around 135 million tonnes in 2010. However, exports have fallen following a series of mining bans across the country and, in 2018, imports of 16 million tonnes almost equaled exports—so the country could easily become a net importer (Exhibit 3).

## Mining in India: Why the country is facing an uncertain future
The distribution of iron ore, of which India is the third-largest producer in the world, is more balanced with Odisha and Chhattisgarh possessing reserves upward of 2.5 billion tonnes (bnt) and 1.4bnt respectively. Yet the primary concern surrounding iron ore is the rate at which India is depleting its reserves.

## Why Is Iron Ore Valuable? Behind the Scenes of Production (+ Top Uses 
Iron ore is a rock from which the metal iron is extracted. About 98% of the world's iron is used to produce steel. Pure iron is an element and a soft grayish-white metal. Other than meteorites that fall from the sky, iron is never found by itself in nature. Most iron is part of minerals that contain other elements.

##  Future of Sponge Iron in India and Plant Design Data
the iron mines for supplying ore to the present steel plants could profitably carry coal without appreciably increasing the traffic, except for the extra time required for loading coal, to allow Sponge Iron to be made on the spot. In order to take care of the ore fines, pre-reduced pellets also will have to be produced side by side with Sponge
