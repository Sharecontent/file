## Crushed LimeStone Density Community Forums
I'm putting in some slotted drainage pipe (french drain) in my yard and I'm trying to calculate the amount of stone I'll need to fill the trench. I just can't find a good approximation for the density of crushed limestone (my supplier sells by the ton, not the yard). The closest I found was one ton is equivalent to approx 16 cubic feet.
