Crushed aggregate is produced by crushing quarry rock, boulders, cobbles, or large-size gravel. Recycled concrete is a viable source of aggregate and has been satisfactorily used in granular subbases, soil-cement, and in new concrete. After harvesting, aggregate is processed: crushed, screened, and washed to obtain proper cleanliness and gradation.
