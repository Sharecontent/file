Manganese is derived from pyrolusite ore, an impure manganese dioxide. In the procedure used to analyze a pyrolusite ore for its MnO2 content, a 0.533 g sample is treated with 1.651 g oxalic acid (H;C;O4â¢2 HÂ¿O) in an acidic medium. Following this reaction, the excess oxalic acid is titrated with 0.1000 M KMNO, 30.06 mL being required.

## Separation of Manganese from Iron in the $$hbox {SO}_{2}$$ SO 2 
Manganese (Mn) extraction from iron-rich pyrolusite ore with cheap sulphur dioxide is considered to be the most promising method with advantages of rapid leaching rate and high leaching efficiency. Nevertheless, co-dissolution of iron (Fe) with manganese has limited the development of its commercial practice. In this work, the separation kinetics and mechanism were investigated during the
