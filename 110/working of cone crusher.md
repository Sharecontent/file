## A Detailed Overview of Cone Crushers and What You Need to Know
How Does a Cone Crusher Work? Cone crushers are straightforward pieces of equipment, which makes it easy to understand. It all starts with the material you need to crush, which is known as the feed. The feed drops into the crushing chamber, which is a large circular opening at the top of a cone crusher. Inside the crusher, a moving part which

Working Principle. When the cone crusher is working, the rotation of the motor rotates by a belt pulley or a coupling. Some drive shaft and cone portion rotates under the urging of the eccentric sleeve. Therefore, the broken wall of the crushing cone is close to and sometimes leaves the surface of the rolling wall fixed on the adjusting sleeve.
