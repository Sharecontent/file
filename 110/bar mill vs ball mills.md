## How to choose between sand mill and ball mill? - Allwin
Aug 27, 2021The results show that the sand mill is far superior to the ball mill in terms of grinding efficiency and preparation cost. The sand mill can produce a powder with an average particle size of less than 0.5μm, which is far smaller than the particle size of the product obtained by the ball milling mechanism. Next, we use an experiment to compare

## Conventional Ball Mill vs. Attritors - Union Process
It should be noted that ball mills are much larger than Attritors and therefore require a special foundation. The Attritor's design accounts for much of the difference: conventional ball mills turn the entire drum or tank containing the media and the material, while Attritors stir the media in a stationary tank with a shaft and attached arms

## What's the Difference Between SAG Mill and Ball Mill
The biggest characteristic of the sag mill is that the crushing ratio is large. The particle size of the materials to be ground is 300 ~ 400mm, sometimes even larger, and the minimum particle size of the materials to be discharged can reach 0.1 mm. The calculation shows that the crushing ratio can reach 3000 ~ 4000, while the ball mill's

Ball mills are factory made and transported to the plant site of the buyer while VRM is built on the site of the cement plant. This helps to reduce cost and complicated logistics issues.
