Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting. After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Copper ore is an ore that can be obtained from copper deposits or copper rocks. Copper ore can be obtained by mining a copper deposit, which spawns in copper resource islands around the player's island. Mining the copper deposit will drop 30 - 50 copper ore. Copper rocks naturally generate on Buffalkor Island and in the Diamond Mines. Mining a copper rock yields 1 - 2 copper ore after each
