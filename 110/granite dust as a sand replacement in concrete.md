##  The role of granite dust in engineered cement composites as  - Springer
powder, stone dust, and quarry waste are used in concrete mixtures [12]. Granite dust, nowadays, is one such com-monly known alternative [13]. Many researchers have studied the use of granite dust as a replacement for sand in conventional concrete. Prokopski et al. [14] have agreed that granite dust is suitable as a con-crete component.
