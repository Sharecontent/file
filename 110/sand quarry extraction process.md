## Gravel Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Offshore sand and gravel extraction involves the abstraction of sediments from a bed which is always covered with seawater. This activity started in the early 20th century (in the mid-1920s, in the United Kingdom), but did not reach a significant scale until the 1960s and 1970s, when markets for marine sand and gravel expanded and dredging technology improved (Fig. 1).

## Sand Extraction: 1. Introduction - GreenFacts
Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.

## Sand Extraction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Offshore sand and gravel extraction involves the abstraction of sediments from a bed which is always covered with seawater. This activity started in the early 20th century (in the mid-1920s, in the United Kingdom), but did not reach a significant scale until the 1960s and 1970s, when markets for marine sand and gravel expanded and dredging technology improved (Fig. 1).
