Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Energy Consumtion Iron Ore Mining-HN Mining Machinery Manufacturer
We use 20 times more iron (in the form of steel) than all other metals put together. Our iron ore trains are over 2.5km (264 ore cars) long, meaning it can take  Feb 03, 2020 In iron ore mining, for example, most energy is required for hauling and loading, so diesel consumption is a major contributor to its GHG emissions.

## Identifying Opportunities to Reduce the Consumption of Energy Across 
benchmarked the energy consumption of open cut iron ore and gold mines. In investigating iron ore in an open cut mine, it was reported that there was potential to reduce the mining costs (based on energy savings) by 36% and milling costs by 47%. For gold mining this estimate was reduced to a staggering 53% for milling. Examples of Energy Events
