I found these rocks today detecting a nature preserve that is well off the beaten path. Not far from them was a very old rail tie, which is weird because I don't think there was ever a ROW in the area. These rocks are very very light, non magnetic, and ring like iron. At first I thought ore or slag, but since they are non magnetic I can't be sure.

It is also possible to reshape raw ores slightly by pounding —depending upon the hardness of the alloy— and the result can sometimes be used as a tool. Metal ores processed in these ways have never been significant in human history, however. (For example, compared with chipped obsidian, chipped iron ore makes a far less usable tool.)
