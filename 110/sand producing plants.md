## How sand is made - material, manufacture, making, history, used 
Stationary plants can produce several thousand tons per hour. Mobile plants are smaller and their output is usually in the range of 50-500 tons (50.8-508 metric tons) per hour. In many locations, an asphalt production plant or a ready mixed concrete plant operates on the same site as the sand and gravel plant.
