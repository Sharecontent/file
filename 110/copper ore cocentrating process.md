## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores - Superfund
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, respectively, due to the different

## Copper ore concentration process
Extraction of copper from complex carbonaceous sulfide ore. An increase in acid concentration to 1.5 mol/L supported copper dissolution yielding the highest copper concentration in solution of 5.19 g/L and the lowest iron concentration of 2.97 g/L. Thereby, a good selectivity of copper over iron during leaching can be achieved using a high pulp density of 300 g/L.
