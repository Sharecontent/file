Alternatively, a roasting process is used to reduce the manganese in the milled ore, followed by a very mild sulphuric acid leach.  Because manganese is very cost effective (over 40 times cheaper than cobalt), it offers an affordable alternative for battery production." Manganese Driving Renewable, Affordable Energy

## Manganese-based batteries will usher in another peak
TodayManganese-based cathode materials are ushering in the second wave of peaks. The first time manganese-based batteries were promoted was when the Nissan Leaf was at its peak. As the second-generation product of manganese-based materials, lithium iron manganese phosphate has entered the early stage of mass production and has attracted much attention in the industry.

## manganese ore for battery productiona
Manganese. manganese was in the range of 100,000 to 200,000 metric tons. Annual ore consumption was about 100,000 tons, of which approximately 90% was derived from imported ore. World production of ore was in the range of 1 to 2 million metric tons. Domestic ore production, which virtually had ceased by 1970,

## USA - Production of electrolytic battery active manganese 
This process concerns the direct electroconversion of low grade manganese ores to high purity manganese dioxide product, which, among other applications, is ideally suited for use in dry cells. The process operating conditions are controlled such that impurities in the ore are substantially eliminated from the product. A decrease in impurity levels in excess of 100 fold can be achieved between
