These dams are almost obsolete. Steel dams are sometimes used as temporary coffer dams during the construction of the permanent dams. Steel coffer dams are supplemented with timber or earthfill on the inner side to make them water tight. The area between the coffer dams is dewatered so that the construction may be done in dry for the permanent dam.

A dam is built on a soil or rock foundation, depending on the type of dam. The foundation must be strong enough to carry the weight of the dam, and the water pressures acting on the dam. The dam foundation is below the original ground level. It is covered by weaker soils or rock that have to be removed either by excavation or by blasting with explosives.
