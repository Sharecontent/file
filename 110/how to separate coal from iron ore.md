## Sponge Iron - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Because of the separation of iron reduction and iron melting/coal gasifying in two steps, a high degree of flexibility is achieved and a wide variety of coals can be used. The process is designed to perform at elevated pressure, up to 5 bar. Charging of coal and iron ore is performed through a lock hopper system.
