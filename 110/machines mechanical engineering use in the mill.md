## What is Milling Machine?- Parts, Operation, Diagram - Engineering Choice
A milling machine is a machine tool that cuts metal as the workpiece is fed against a rotating multipoint cutter. The milling cutter rotates at a very high speed because of the multiple cutting edges, it cuts the metal at a very fast rate. This machine can also hold single or multiple cutters at the same time.

Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

Milling Machine Definition: The milling machine is a type of machine which removes the material from the workpiece by feeding the work past a rotating multipoint cutter.The metal removal rate is higher very high as the cutter has a high speed and many cutting edges. It is the most important machine in the tool room as nearly all the operations can be performed on it with high accuracy.
