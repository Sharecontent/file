Limestone, gypsum, granite, marble, sandstone and slate are just a few of the many quarried materials. A great deal of work goes into determining quarry location and size where quality blocks can be extracted. Specialized drill bits are used to remove core samples. Those samples are then tested to ensure suitability.

The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.
