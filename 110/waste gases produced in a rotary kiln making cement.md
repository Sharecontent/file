RDF, or Refuse Derived Fuel, uses a technology that produces energy from waste that's unsuitable for traditional recycling. Without this method of energy recovery, non-recyclable refuse would simply be sent to landfill or be incinerated - with a negative impact on the environment. RDF captures the energy in non-recyclable waste and turns it.
