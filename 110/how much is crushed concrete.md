## Gravel Calculator | How much gravel do you need?
You can calculate the required volume of gravel by multiplying the gravel path area by the desired thickness: 23 yd²  0.1 yd = 2.3 yd³. The last things to assess are the estimated weight of the required gravel and its cost. Knowledge about the weight of the cargo may come in handy when it comes to transportation.

Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.
