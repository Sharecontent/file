## Belt Conveyors - Grainger Industrial Supply
Incline-bed belt conveyors have a steep 45° incline. The intake end of the conveyors mounts low to the ground to catch small parts, waste, or other bulk materials as they come out of a process or machine and carry the items up to elevated bins, hoppers, drums, or similar containers or up to a higher level in a facility for further processing.
