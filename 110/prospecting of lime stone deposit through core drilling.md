## How to Drill Limestone | Hunker
Do not hold the drill at an angle when drilling into limestone. This may cause the limestone to crack. Natural stone often has fault lines running through it. Avoid drilling through the fault lines, if possible, since the vibration of the drill could cause the fault to open. To prevent cracking the edges of the limestone, avoid drilling near

## Using Test Drilling to Sample Gold Deposits
Test drilling is done to get a continuous sample of the bedrock of a given gold project. The sample is then tested to determine if there is gold in the project area and to estimate the amount of gold that can be mined in the area. Quite often test drilling may produce a variety of result as each hole may encounter different types of rocks and

## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
Prospecting involves searching an area for mineral deposits with the view to mine it at a profit. In other words to transform the mineral deposit into an ore deposit. A geologist prospecting an area is looking for surface exposure of minerals, by observing irregularities in colour, shape or rock composition.

In faulting, the area displaced can contain similar contamination. If the deposit is broken up in blocks, additional testing will need to be done to determine the boundaries of the good limestone. Sampling and testing in the mine will need to increase. Chip samples along with face samples will be used to locate the areas of good quality stone.
