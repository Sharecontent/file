## Baryte
Baryte, barite or barytes (/ ˈ b ær aɪ t, ˈ b ɛər-/ or / b ə ˈ r aɪ t iː z /) is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate (Ba S O 4). Baryte is generally white or colorless, and is the main source of the element barium.The baryte group consists of baryte, celestine (strontium sulfate), anglesite (lead sulfate), and anhydrite (calcium sulfate). Baryte and celestine form a solid solution

BaSO 4 is known to compose a solid solution series with SrSO 4 as celestobarite in the skeletal portions of some marine organisms (i.e., the Xenophyophoria) and is often found in association with marine organic matter, such

Barite is ubiquitous and known to incorporate 226 Ra through the formation of a solid-solution. In U mining mill tailings, barite is one of the dominant sulfate-binding minerals. In such environments, sequential extractions are generally used to identify the U- and 226 Ra-binding phases and their associated reactivity. To better decipher the main processes governing the behavior of 226 Ra
