## mining - Quarrying | Britannica
The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)

## Quarrying of Stones: Its Methods, Selection of Site  - CivilSeek
The process of extraction of suitable stones from their natural rock beds or layers is commonly called Quarrying of Stones. You'll know its methods, process.  In quarrying operations, considerable man power is employed. Water is an important necessity for the work force. It must be available in sufficient quantity near the quarry site.

## Quarrying | Process and Equipment | Applications | Epiroc US
Quarrying is used mainly in the production of construction and building materials, such as solid stone or crushed rock for aggregates, or for raw materials for processes such as cement manufacture. As a technique, quarrying is normally only used where raw materials of adequate quality and size cannot be obtained economically by other means.
