## drilling mud | excavation | Britannica
drilling mud, also called drilling fluid, in petroleum engineering, a heavy, viscous fluid mixture that is used in oil and gas drilling operations to carry rock cuttings to the surface and also to lubricate and cool the drill bit. The drilling mud, by hydrostatic pressure, also helps prevent the collapse of unstable strata into the borehole and the intrusion of water from water-bearing strata

Barite sag. Barite or weight material sag is a problem of drilling mud and it occurs when weighting material (barite, calcium carbonate, etc) separate from liquid phase and settle down. The method is based in part on continuously measuring fluid density during the first circulation after the fluid has been static after some time.
