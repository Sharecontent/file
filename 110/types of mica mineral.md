## Mica Capacitor : Construction, Types, Characteristics & Its Applications
Mica capacitor is one kind of capacitor where the mica (silicate mineral) is used as a dielectric material that can be found in rocks, granites, etc. This material plays a key role in electrical applications like an electrical insulator. These components are reliable, stable, and high precision which is available from different ranges like low

Here are the benefits of high aspect ratio mica over glass fiber: Mica reinforces in all directions, but glass fiber only reinforces in one direction (parallel to the fiber length) meaning that real-world results are superior with mica. Mica greatly reduces CTE and warpage compared to glass fiber. Mica acts as an excellent barrier to liquids

## clay mineral | Definition, Structure, Composition, Uses, Types 
The SiO 2 ratio in a formula is the key factor determining clay mineral types. These minerals can be classified on the basis of variations of chemical composition and atomic structure into nine groups: (1) kaolin-serpentine (kaolinite, halloysite, lizardite, chrysotile), (2) pyrophyllite-talc, (3) mica (illite, glauconite, celadonite), (4
