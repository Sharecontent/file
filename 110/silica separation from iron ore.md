## Developments in the physiochemical separation of iron ore
The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation. Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron. Since 1849, a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA, and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processing.

Iron Ore - Mining Artifacts. The typical magnetite iron ore concentrate has less than 0.1% phosphorus, 3-7% silica and less than 3% aluminum. The grain size of the magnetite and its degree of comingling with the silica groundmass determine the grind size to which the rock must be reduced to enable efficient magnetic separation to provide a high purity magnetite concentrate.

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## silica sparation from iron ore
 A study of silica and iron recovery from the iron ore concentration tailing is presented. The residue is composed of 40.1% Fe, 33.4% SiO 2, 8.31% Al 2 O 3, 0.08% P, and 0.34% MnO. The developed process of silica and iron recovery consisted of size classification, magnetic separation, and removal of impurities by leaching.
