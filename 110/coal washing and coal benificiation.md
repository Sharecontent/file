Coal Rejects are basically a by-product of the coal washing or coal beneficiation process in which after separation of beneficiated washed coal and Middlings, the rejects are left over as a portion of raw feed coal. These are generated from the coarse circuit of the coal washery process. No additional crushing or blending is required for its usage.
