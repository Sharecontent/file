Quarry dust satisfies the reason behind the alternative material as a substitute for sand at very low cost. It even causes burden to dump the crusher dust at one place which causes environmental pollution. From the results of experimental investigations conducted, it is concluded that the quarry dust can be used as a replacement for fine aggregate.
