Quarry dust satisfies the reason behind the alternative material as a substitute for sand at very low cost. It even causes burden to dump the crusher dust at one place which causes environmental pollution. From the results of experimental investigations conducted, it is concluded that the quarry dust can be used as a replacement for fine aggregate.

## engineering properties of crusher stone dust
Engineering Stone dust is a kind of solid waste material that is generated from stone crushing industry which is abundantly available. It is estimated that each crusher unit produce 15%-20% stone dust. Disposal of such wastes poses lots of geoenvironmental problems such as landfill disposal problems, health and environmental hazards. get price
