## Mine Ventilation - Ventilation control of dust in coal mines - GRT
Ventilation control of dust in coal mines is important in the different types of underground coal mining such as (1) room and pillar mining, (2) longwall mining and (3) shaft mining. Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining

## Coal Miners - West Virginia
Between 1880 and 1920, southern West Virginia's population grew from 93,000 to 446,000, due almost entirely to the coal industry. The region's first coal miners primarily were African Americans, both enslaved and free. By 1850, approximately half of Kanawha County's slaves worked in the salt industry—many mined coal to fuel the furnaces.
