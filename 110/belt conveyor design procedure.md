## 3 Basic Conveyor Belt Tracking Rules To Follow
For short and wide conveyors, plastic modular belts are common alternative to traditional fabric belts. Plastic modular belts are sprocket driven, and thereby positively located by the fixed position of a drive sprocket. For the design of modular belts, the conveyor's special requirements must be taken into account.

Best Practices: Conveyor guarding should weigh 50 pounds or less. Guarding should have no sharp edges and should stand out in color from equipment it is guarding. To increase safety, guarding should require a tool to remove. Emergency stop switches need to be tested every 30 days and not span more than 70 feet between switches.
