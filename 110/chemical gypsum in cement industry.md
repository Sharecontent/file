## Why Gypsum is Added to Cement? - GKToday
When cement is mixed with water, it becomes hard over a period of time. This is called setting of cement. Gypsum is often added to Portland cement to prevent early hardening or "flash setting", allowing a longer working time. Gypsum slows down the setting of cement so that cement is adequately hardened.

## Gypsum manufacturer and trader for Plaster of paries and cement industries
CEMENT & POP INDUSTRY. Gypsum (a bi-product of salt) is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. Gypsum plays a very important role in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.

## Use of gypsum/brucite mixed precipitate instead of gypsum in Portland 
The possibility of replacing the natural gypsum used in cement production by a chemical precipitate consisting of gypsum (CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O) and brucite (Mg(OH) 2), was investigated. This precipitate is a by-product of a new hydrometallurgical process, which was developed in order to treat economically low-grade nickel oxide ores.

## Why is Gypsum added to Cement? | McCoy Mart
Ordinary Portland cement is hydraulic cement which hardens very fast due to a chemical reaction with water. In order to prevent the early hardening time or to control the flash setting of cement gypsum is added to the cement. If gypsum is not added the cement will set very rapidly and the cement shall not get any working time for concrete setting.
