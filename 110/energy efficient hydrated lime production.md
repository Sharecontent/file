Theoretically, the potential for energy efficiency improvement is, therefore, limited to 29%; the rest of the fuel is needed to provide the energy for the chemical reaction. Limestone always contains impurities and a driving force is always required to get the reaction going.  The heat resulting from the production of hydrated lime amounts
