## A Guide to the Four Main Methods of Mining
More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's
