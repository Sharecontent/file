The ore then goes through smeltering and converting and the process ends with the refined ore being made into copper plates ready for sale to the world market (Figure 1) (2,3,4). This type of mining produces many harmful products such as sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide along the way.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product
