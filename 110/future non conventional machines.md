## Difference between Conventional and Non-Conventional Machining
Conventional machining is the process of removing material from a workpiece to create the desired shape. This is done by using a variety of tools such as drills, milling cutters, and lathes to remove the material. Non-conventional machining is a process that uses unconventional methods to remove material from a workpiece.

## Difference between Conventional and Non-conventional Sources of Energy
Most of the machines are running in the conventional source of energy. Conventional sources of energy are used for industrial, commercial, and domestically. On the other hand, non-conventical sources of energy are used on a small scale. Currently, few countries use solar energy to run their cars and house equipment.
