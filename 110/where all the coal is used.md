## How does coal generate electricity? | National Grid ESO
The principle of how coal generates electricity is fundamentally the same as in Edison's day, and similar to other thermal power stations like gas : the coal is burned, heating water to create steam, which spins a turbine to produce electricity. Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this is how much of Britain's power was

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

##  For Immediate Release
• Use of all coal combustion products in cement production declined 4 percent to 4.8 million tons. • Utilization of a key "non-ash" coal combustion product posted a modest increase. Synthetic gypsum is a byproduct of flue gas desulphurization units, also known as "scrubbers," located at coal-fueled power plants.
