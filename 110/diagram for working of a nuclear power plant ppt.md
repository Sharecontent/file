## Basic Layout and Working of a Nuclear Power Plant
A nuclear reactor consists of fuel rods, control rods and moderator. A fuel rod contains small round fuel pallets (uranium pallets). Control rods are of cadmium which absorb neutrons. They are inserted into reactor and can be moved in or out to control the reaction. The moderator can be graphite rods or the coolant itself.

## How Nuclear Energy Works.ae
Power plants that run on fossil fuels burn coal, oil or natural gas to generate heat. In a nuclear energy plant, heat is produced from splitting atoms - a process called nuclear fission. Nuclear reactor creates heat that is used to make steam. The steam turns a turbine connected to an electromagnet, called a generator.
