The unbound graded aggregate base (UGAB) has been widely used in drainage layers of highway pavements. This kind of material is of high permeability and can thus drain efficiently the water infiltrated through cracks in the pavement and reduce the associated water damage. The hydraulic conductivity of UGAB is a key factor describing the water flow behavior in UGAB and thus be considered

Aggregate is typically divided into two components:! Fine aggregate including sand - material passing a 3/8-inch screen sieve, essentially all passing a # 4 sieve (i.e., a .187-inch square opening). ! Coarse aggregate including gravel - generally considered being crushed stone or gravel, almost all of which is retained on a No. 4 sieve.
