## Manganese
This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 and 250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe 2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio.

## Manganese Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
5.3.7 Manganese Ore. Manganese ore is required in iron making to control the manganese content of the hot metal in the desired range. Unlike other plants, where manganese ore lump is used directly in blast furnace, in VSP, it was proposed to use manganese ore fines in sinter productions. This would ensure much more consistent manganese content
