Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.

History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

Normally sand, gravel, and crushed stone are used as aggregates to make concrete. The aggregate should be well-graded to improve packing efficiency and minimize the amount of cement paste needed. Also, this makes the concrete more workable. Some of the important properties of aggregates are discussed below.

## Aggregate definition and Shape, Types, Properties - Civil Knowledges
Aggregates are the major ingredients of concrete. Aggregates are derived from rocks. They are broadly divided into two categories i.e. fine aggregate and coarse aggregate. Their properties are depended on the mineralogical composition of the rock. Crushed rocks are used as coarse aggregates are river sand is used as fine aggregates.
