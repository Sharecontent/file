## How the Gold Business Operates - CNBC
Sep 1, 2011Gold mines produce rough gold, called a dore bar. These bars are typically about 80 percent pure gold. The gold is then sent to a refinery, where it is refined into gold of different forms and purity.

## Ask MGS: What are Gold Concentrates? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
Gold concentrates tend to be mostly iron, so they are also known as "black sands.". Gold concentrates are also made by grinding down ore, quartz, or other productive rock types into sand. This procedure is much faster and easier than panning, but the tradeoff is a final product that has less gold "concentrated" within.

The Old Copper Complex in North America has been radiometrically dated to 9500 BP—i.e., about 7480 BCE—making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world.

## Gold Refinery Prices - How much does a gold refinery charge?
You need to pay special attention to the rise of gold prices if you send scrap to refine regularly. When it goes up, your settlements, no matter which refinery you work with, should follow the same patterns and fluctuate like the gold market. If gold is projected to grow in 2022, then the gold refinery prices should go up.

For refining, gold bearing alloys are processed on different methods, depending on their carat content. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. Alternatively, it can be a complex mix of burning, drying, grinding, screening, blending and sampling for low-grade scrap and floor sweepings.
