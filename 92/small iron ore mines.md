## Heavy metal pollution caused by small-scale metal ore mining activities 
Heavy metal pollution in a small-scale metal ore mining area was investigated.  The production scale of this mine was set at 0.05 Mt/yr of raw iron ore and 0.03 Mt/yr raw lead‑zinc ore, which merely meet the minimum thresholds for establishing a mining operation. Although the planned production period was 10 years, the actual production

Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.

Iron ore is an ore that can be mined from iron rocks. Iron rocks naturally generate in the mining zone in the Hub, Slime Island, Buffalkor Island, and the Diamond Mines. Mining an iron rock yields 1 - 2 iron ore per stage, resulting in a total of 2 - 4 iron ore. There's also a 1.5% chance that the rock drops crystallized iron. Iron totems can be purchased from Arius at the Hub for 4,000 coins

## Iron Ore - Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety
Uses. Iron is the world's most commonly used metal, and iron ore is a key ingredient for steel making. To produce 1,000 kilograms of crude steel requires about 1,400 kilograms of iron ore (and around 800 kilograms of coal). Iron can be alloyed with a variety of elements to produce stronger and harder products which are useful in the

## Iron Ore Deposits in Sri Lanka ~ LankaPradeepa
Investigations have revealed that the deposit is composed of an ore reserve of 4 million tons with 1-2% copper and 40% metallic iron (The National Atlas of Sri Lanka, 2007). The ore occurs up to a depth of about 100 m, which limits the open cast mining as in the case of the Panirendawa deposit (Fernando, 1986). Hydrated iron ore deposits.
