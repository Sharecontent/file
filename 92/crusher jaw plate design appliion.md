High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance. However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.
