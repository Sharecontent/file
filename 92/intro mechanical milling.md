## Introduction to Mechanical Alloying | SpringerLink
Abstract. Mechanical alloying is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high energy collision from the balls. The process is usually carried out in an inert atmosphere. It is an alternative technique for producing metallic and ceramic powder particles in the solid state.

## Finishing (textiles)
Singeing is a preparation method of textiles; it is applied more commonly to woven textiles and cotton yarns. Singeing in textiles is a mechanical treatment or finish to obtain a neat surface of the fabric or less hairy yarn. In a singeing machine, the yarns or fabrics are exposed to direct flames to burn the protruding fibers of the textile materials. . Hence, also called "gass

## CONTROLLING MECHANICAL LOADS IN MILLING OPERATIONS - Seco Tools
Loads on the cutting tools in milling are determined largely by the way the cutter and its cutting edges enters the workpiece. In conventional or "up" milling, the cutter rotates against the direction of workpiece feed. In climb or "down" milling, the cutter moves in the same direction as the feed. As a result, in conventional milling
