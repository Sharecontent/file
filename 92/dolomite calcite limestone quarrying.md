## Dolomite: Identification, Pictures & Info for Rockhounds
Dolomite, or dolostone, is a carbonate sedimentary rock made mostly from the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO3)2. It commonly occurs in association with limestone and shares many of the same properties, but reacts only weakly with acid. Dolomite often has a sugary texture and is typically off-white to gray in color.

## Agricultural Limestone vs Dolomite - Braen Stone
Pros - Like aglime, dolomite is able to very effectively raise soil pH. At the same time, it's able to correct soil with a magnesium deficiency. For optimum health, sandy soil should have a calcium to magnesium ratio of 7:1 for sandy soil and 10:1 for clay-based soil. Cons - Dolomitic lime shouldn't be applied where it isn't needed.

Dolomite differs from calcite because of the presence of magnesium. • Calcite reacts quickly with acids and produce carbon dioxide bubbles. But dolomite is weakly reacts with acids producing bubbles very slowly. When hot acids or powdered dolomite is used they may react quickly. • Dolomite is slightly harder and denser than calcite.

## Dolomite - Complete Mineral Overview
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of nominally equal parts calcium and magnesium, with the formula CaMg (CO 3) 2. Its chemical formula can be more clearly written as CaCO 3 .MgCO 3. Because of the presence of two various cations, which form regular layers inside dolomite structure, dolomite crystal symmetry is lower than calcite.

## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.
