## What is agglomeration industry?nsvillealliance
Agglomeration, the sticking of particles to one another or to solid surfaces, is a natural phenomenon. For powders and bulk solids, agglomeration can be unwanted, resulting in uncontrolled buildup, caking, bridging, or lumping. It involves combining particles to create products with new particle sizes.

## Cement Industry in India - Economics Discussion
Since 1930, despite internal and external competition, the progress of the industry was remarkably continuous. Production rose from 5.70 lakh tons in to 18 lakh tons in . During the same period, imports declined from 64,000 tons to 21,000 tons. In 1939, there were 19 cement factories in India employing about 11000 workers.

## Agglomerating Gold Ores - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Current development involves the mining and heap leaching of some 1000 TPD. Carbon is employed as a recovery medium. Due to its clayey nature and excessive fines in the oxide ore, agglomeration using Portland cement is required prior to leaching. The ore ranges in screen size from two inches to -200 mesh.
