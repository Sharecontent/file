## Difference between Cone & Gyratory Crusher
A gyratory crusher has a higher angle at the cone apex. This provides a longer residence time along the crushing interface and is supposed to generate a smaller & more consistent product. Metso Minerals have much more, probably much better, information on their website. 28th January 2009, 0:44 #3.

## Gyratory Crushers - SolidsWiki
A Gyratory Cone Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. Gyratory cone crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory cone crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing.
