## Utilization of steel plants waste - MedCrave online
Abstract. Utilization of waste generated by steel plants has become a crucial issue due to ever-tightening environment regulations. Such rules implemented on steel makers have raised the circumstances to reduce the wastes generated by steel plants. Approximately 500 kg waste materials are generated per tonne of crude steel by the steel plant.

Scrap continues to be the primary raw material used in EAFs, but DRI may become a larger component in the raw materials mix. Iron and steel scrap is classified as home, old, and new scrap. Home, or mill, scrap is generated in the steel mill during production and is recycled in the same facility. Old scrap is postconsumer scrap.

## Steelmaking
Steelmaking is the process of producing steel from iron ore and/or scrap. In steelmaking, impurities such as nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur and excess carbon (the most important impurity) are removed from the sourced iron, and alloying elements such as manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon and vanadium are added to produce different grades

## Use of steel scrap saves billions in climate and environmental costs 
In conclusion, the study suggests that the scrap bonus needs to be incorporated in the price mechanism. The scientists conclude that using one ton of recycled stainless steel scrap saves 4.3 tons of CO2 in stainless steel production. With carbon steel, the average saving of using one tonne of steel scrap is 1.67 tons of CO2.
