## silver processing | Britannica
Silver (Ag), like gold, crystallizes in the face-centred cubic system. It melts when heated to 962 °C (1,764 °F). With a density of 10.49 grams per cubic centimetre, it is the lightest of the precious metals. It is also the least noble of the precious metals, reacting readily with many common reagents such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

## silver mining process
A slurry of ground ore, water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved. Following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver. This process removes 93% of the gold and 70% of the silver.

Posted on December 28, 2011 by GSM. Mankind has mined silver for thousands of years. Two early methods of mining silver were sluicing and hard-wall extraction. Sluicing involves assembling trenches in irrigation holes to filter out heavy metals from the mine. Unfortunately, sluicing is inefficient and ineffective method for obtaining silver.

Silver (Ag), like gold, crystallizes in the face-centred cubic system. It melts when heated to 962° C (1,764° F). With a density of 10.49 grams per cubic centimeter, it is the lightest of the precious metals. It is also the least noble of the precious metals, reacting readily with many common reagents such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid.
