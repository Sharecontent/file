## Copper in plants | Cropaia
Its concentration in plant tissue ranges from 5 to 20 ppm and in soil from 2 to 100 ppm (mg kg -­ ). However, most of the copper in the soil is not available for plants. Availability of copper increases in soil pH below 7.0 and decreases at a higher pH, due to fixation to soil clay minerals. Copper tends to easily bind to organic matter.

## Copper For The Garden: What Copper Does For Plants - Gardening Know How
Image by statu-nascendi. Copper is an essential element for plant growth. Soils naturally contain copper in some form or other, ranging anywhere from 2 to 100 parts per million (ppm) and averaging at about 30 ppm. Most plants contain about 8 to 20 ppm. Without adequate copper, plants will fail to grow properly.
