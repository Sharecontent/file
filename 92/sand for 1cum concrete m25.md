There are two main ways to design the concrete mix. Design mix method :- In this method, materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code . In this method, cement, sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight, and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.

To chaliye post ki taraf aage badhte hain. Cement, Sand, Aggregate aur Water ki quantity nikalne ke liye maine yaha Concrete ka Volume considered kiya hain 1 Cubic Meter.Agar apko 1 se jada Cubic Meter ke liye material nikalna hain to simply apko 1 Cubic Meter me jitna material apko lag raha hain, use apke Concrete ke Volume se multiply kar dena hoga. Apko apke material ka weight mil jayega.

Hence, we require 323 Kg or 6.5 bags of cement for 1m 3 of concrete. Sand; Usually sand consists of moisture content that will increases the volume of sand due to bulking of sand effect. That is density of sand varies = 1600 - 1800 kg/m 3. here we use 1600kg/m 3. Weight of sand required = 1600 × 0.448 = 716.8 kg

## How To Calculate Cement, Sand & Aggregates Quantity in Concrete
Some of Mix is - 5.5. Where, M = Mix. 20 = Characteristic Compressive strength. Consider volume of concrete = 1m3. Dry Volume of Concrete = 1 x 1.54 = 1.54 m3 (For Dry Volume Multiply By 1.54) Now we start calculation to find Cement, Sand and Aggregate quality in 1 cubic meter of concrete.
