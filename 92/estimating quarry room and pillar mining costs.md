## Room And Pillar Mining - Ciner
The Room and Pillar Method, also referred to as the Pillar and Stall Method, is one of the world's oldest mining systems. Dating beyond the 1840s, this method has been commonly used in mining coal, iron, and other base metals. In the 1970s, over 50% of coal mining in the United States used this method.

May 30, 2018 Studies estimate that 156 billion tons of coal, representing 68 pct of the minable reserves in the United States, is subject to multiple-seam mining. Historically, room-and-pillar mining has dominated coal production, and this mining method has been the focus of most multiple-seam research.

The quarrying process consists of separating large blocks, sometimes called loafs, from the surrounding rock. These blocks may be 6 metres high by 6 metres deep and 12 to 18 metres (about 40 to 60 feet) long, and they may weigh in the range of 1,200 to 2,000 tons. (Such large blocks are subsequently divided into mill blocks weighing 15 to 70 tons.)

Miners call those walls pillar and thats the reason why this is called Room and Pillar Mining . The disadvantage of the process is obvious, part of the extracted raw material is needed as pillars and therefore cannot be mined.
