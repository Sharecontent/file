## Chemicals Used In Iron Ore Mining
Energy And Environmental Profile Of The U.s. Mining. .1.1 Iron Ore Mining There are two basic methods of mining iron ore. These are Surface mining or open-pit mining Underground or shaft mining To be competitive, iron mining must be done on a very large scale. Surface mining is the preferred choice, although there are exceptions.

Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals. The smelting process allows the iron ore to be heated with carbon. The carbon combines with the oxygen and carries it away, leaving behind iron. Blast furnaces are so hot which is why they melt the iron, and drain it off to be poured into moulds to form bars, called ingots.

This "Mineralogy in Mining" blog series started with a general overview of the value of mineralogical monitoring for an efficient ore beneficiation.During the last decades high-grade iron ore deposits, particularly in Western Australia, required hardly any downstream processing. Iron ores were simply crushed and shipped as lump ore for iron making.

## Isolation, identification and characterization of some bacteria from 
The use of microbes to degrade such type of minerals is gaining acceptance. This study was carried out, therefore to isolate, identify and characterize iron solubilizing bacteria from Iron stones of Agbaja iron ore mining site of Kogi State. Crushed samples in the range of 0.25µm and 0.75µm particle size were used for the isolation.

## How Is The Iron Ore Mined? - FTM Machinery
Therefore, the mining of iron ore has been controlled by several large companies. Iron ore is the main component of steel and accounts for 95% of the world's metal use each year. The world's largest single iron ore producer is the Brazilian mining company called Vale, which produces more than 350 million tons of iron ore per year.
