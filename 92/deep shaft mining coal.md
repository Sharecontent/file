## Former Mining Communities of the Cherokee-Crawford Coal Field
Besides being sited near shaft mines, the coal mining communities were located on or very near section roads. Oral communication with former coal field employees and other knowledgeable persons disclosed that generally the section roads preceded the camps.

## Underground Coal Mining - Department of Environmental Protection
Underground mining involves opening one or more portals or shafts into the earth that follow or intercept coal seams that are too deep for surface mining methods. Two main methods of underground mining are practiced in Pennsylvania: Room-and-Pillar: Generally used for seams that are relatively flat or gently dipping.

Mining sites. Deep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process undergoing research which takes place on the ocean floor.Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 3,000 - 6,500 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold

Minerals Extracted. Surface mining is commonly used to extract coal and copper, and increasingly, precious metals like gold. Underground mining is used for gold, platinum, zinc, lead, and increasingly, coal. As can be seen, surface mining is much more advantageous than its counterpart. However, when an outcropping ore body stretches deep inside

Shaft mining or shaft sinking is the action of excavating a mine shaft from the top down, where there is initially no access to the bottom. Shallow shafts, typically sunk for civil engineering projects, differ greatly in execution method from deep shafts, typically sunk for mining projects..
