## Difference Between Open Circuit And Close Circuit During Crushing
Both the primary and secondary crushers operate in an open circuit, while the tertiary crusher is installed in a closed-circuit configuration. In addition to size reduction, the primary stage also extracts a low-quality natural fines product from the feed material, which is most suitable for applications where the demands on the product are low.
