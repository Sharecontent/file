Limestone mining began in Florida during the First Spanish Period. In 1672, construction began on the Castillo de San Marcos in St. Augustine. Locally mined coquina was used. This is the oldest masonry fort in the continental United States. In 1753, construction began on a limestone fort in St. Marks to replace older wooden structures.
