## Nickel Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Investment costs of mines vary considerably between mining operations. This is due to differences in ore grades, mine sizes, mining methods, topography and ground conditions. The costs for constructing an underground mine are considerably higher than those for constructing an open-pit mine, expressed per annual tonne of mined nickel.

The extraction of nickel from ore follows much the same route as copper, and indeed, in a number of cases, similar processes and equipment are used. The major differences in equipment are the use of higher-temperature refractories and the increased cooling required to accommodate the higher operating temperatures in nickel production. The specific processes taken depend on whether the ore is a

## Nickel element extraction, mining technique - flash, electric smelting 
MINING AND PROCESSING : The mining methods differ with respect to the type of ore being mined. Since nickel is composed in two types of ores, both of them are mined differently. The sulfide ores are mined using underground mining methods though open-pit mining can also be done in early stages.

## Enhanced methods for nickel recovery from low-grade ores and bleed streams
Whether high-grade or low-grade, nickel ores need to be processed after mining, in order to upgrade their nickel content from 1-4% Ni to 10-20%. Concentrating the nickel ores usually takes place close to the mine site, and involves chemical and physical processes to crush the ore and separate the nickel-bearing and gangue minerals.

## Lateritic nickel ore deposits
Nickel laterites are a very important type of nickel ore deposit. They are growing to become the most important source of nickel metal for world demand (currently second to sulfide nickel ore deposits ). Nickel laterites are generally mined via open cut mining methods. Nickel is extracted from the ore by a variety of process routes.
