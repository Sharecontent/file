## What is open pit mining used for?idegrillandbar
Score: 4.9/5 (6 votes) . Open pit mining is a technique used to extract copper ore near the earth's surface.Open pit mining is the most widely used technique of mining copper today. It is accomplished by creating and using benches or terraces to gradually reach deeper under the earth's surface.

## What Is Open Pit Mining? | An Underground Miner
Strip mining is a surface technique where workers clear vegetation, waste rock, and overburden from the ground. Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface. Open-pit mining differs as workers excavate large landscapes on deeper slopes, separated by "benches."

## May 1 Surface Mining Techniques used in the Oil Sands
Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.

Mining of Iron Ores IspatGuru. Mar 14, 2014 Fig 1 A typical open pit iron ore mine. On the basis of mining methods, iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely manual mining and mechanized mining. Large iron ore mines are mechanized mines while manual mining methods are employed in the small mines.
