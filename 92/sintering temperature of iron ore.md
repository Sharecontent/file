## Laboratory Studies on Iron Ore Sintering and Testing
Some of the variables encountered in the sintering of iron ores and their effect on sinter properties have been investigated at the Jones and Laughlin Ore Research Laboratory in Michigan. Ores requiring agglomeration before blast furnace utilization may be classed as coarse, intermediate or fine. Coarse iron ore is considered similar to a —¼

## Theory and Practice of Sintering of Iron ore - IspatGuru
The process of sintering is a thermal operation involving melting and assimilation reactions. The first stage of the sintering process is the formation of the melt which involves the reaction between fine iron ore particles and fluxes. The initial melt is generated from adhering fines during heating via reaction between iron ore and fluxes.

## Coupled Typical Coke Gasification and Sintering Ore Reduction in CO-N2 
Through thermodynamic calculation and high-temperature simulation experiments, the coupling behavior between gasification of high- and low-reactivity cokes and reduction of sintering ore in CO-N2-H2 mixed gas with 25% H2 volume fraction was studied, and the evolution of the coke carbon structure and the pore structure was analyzed. The results show that the reaction rate of the two cokes

## How to determine sintering temperature?
What is high temperature sintering? In general, high temperature sintering is considered to be from 1175°C (2150°F) to 1425°C (2600°F)[1].  These microstructural enhancements are the result of increased sintering activity at higher temperatures and lead to improved static and dynamic properties.
