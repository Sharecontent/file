## Pretreatment of Copper Sulphide Ores Prior to Heap Leaching: A Review
One solution is to be able to process copper sulphide ores hydrometallurgically. However, it is widely known that sulphide copper ores—and chalcopyrite in particular—have very slow dissolution kinetics in traditional leaching systems. An alternative to improve the extraction of copper from sulphide ores is the use of a pretreatment process.

## Recovery of copper values from copper ores - Hydromet Systems L. L. C.
Copper values are efficiently recovered from a copper ore, including secondary sulfides, by first crushing the ore to a particle size P-80 of about 1 to 2 inches, then grinding the so crushed ore to a particle size P-80 of between Tyler 4 mesh and 20 mesh, and then classifying the ground ore into a fines fraction of less than 65 mesh and one or more coarse fractions of more than 65 mesh.

It is a process to extract trace metal from ore. The ore is treated with lixiviants inside large tanks, and the material is ground sufficiently fine to form a slurry. Before this process, ore undergoes size reduction via crushing and grinding. Tank leaching is seen in gold cyanidation, the process of extracting gold from low-grade ores.

## The application of sodium nitrite oxidation and fine grinding in 
Since 1984, nitrogen-species catalyzed pressure leaching has been utilized at the Sunshine Mining and Refining Company for the recovery of precious metals from a refractory sulfide concentrate. The process operates without the use of cyanide. The plant is now the only industrial-scale commercial application of this technology. Since the inception of the process, changes have been implemented
