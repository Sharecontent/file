## recycling ferrous grinding swarf and dust - Industrial/Mfg engineering 
I am part of a team that has designed a swarf recycling system for a plant in Nebraska. The plant produces 5 tons of ferrous swarf per week. The swarf also consists of fiber filtering media, grinding abrasives and a hydrocarbon based cutting fluid. The system we designed is "turn-key" and operating costs are BELOW the current landfill costs.

## Grinding and Dust Control: More Than Just "Because OSHA Says So"
The solution to most dust issues is actually quite simple: attach a shroud and hook up a HEPA vacuum. Many handheld and walk-behind grinders already include a shroud to control the dust. Pair this with the appropriate HEPA vacuum and you are on your way to compliance with OSHA silica regulations. Note that both of these measures are mandatory.

## A road map for grinding and finishing stainless steel - The Fabricator
Grinding wheels on their own don't grind; they need a power tool. Anyone can tout the benefits of an abrasive wheel or a power tool, but the reality is that power tools and their grinding wheels work as a system.  When polishing to a mirror finish, a finisher might cross-sand with a finishing drum or disc, sanding in a direction

## Toxicity of grinding (steel, carbide, etc)? - Practical Machinist
I grind primarily drills (many), and tool bits (HSS, Cobalt steel). When I grind (HSS, Carbon steel, Carbide, etc), I can not miss the little warning labels: 'use dust collection, grinding dust is toxic'. My understanding is that particles (metal, or grinding abrasives) lodge in the lung (like asbestos), and cause problems.
