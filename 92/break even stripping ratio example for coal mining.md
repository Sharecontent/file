## stripping ratio in coal mining
Apr 04, 2016 The maximum allowable Stripping Ratio (SR max) defines break even stripping ratio (BESR)This represents the highest possible units of waste that can be handled If the SR exceeds the BESR then the operation will be uneconomical as the income generated by the ore is insufficient to offset the costs incurred in mining.

In order to specify the maximum allowable stripping ratio (SR max) of a surface mine, break even ratio can help to establishes the pit limits.  Example 1: A seam of coal has a density of 1.36 t/m 3 and is 2.5 m thick.  or in the case of dramatic increase in the stripping ratio, the mining operation must be ceased

Mining will proceed by advancing into the hillside until reaching the break-even stripping ratio. At this point, the highwall will remain. Under certain conditions, we may choose to take advantage of the exposed coal seam, and develop an underground mine or practice highwall mining, which will be discussed later in this lesson.

The SR max is determined solely by economics, to establish the ultimate boundary of the pit, where break even occurs, i.e. the profit margin is zero. As we defined it before, SR max ( yd 3 /ton) = Ore Revenue ($/ton)-Production Cost ($/ton) Stripping Cost ($/yd 3) (Equation 3.2.7) So, it is a physical quantity that is determined by economics.

## Stripping ratio
In surface mining, stripping ratio or strip ratio refers to the amount of waste (or overburden) that must be removed to release a given ore quantity. It is a number or ratio that express how much waste is mined per unit of ore. The units of a stripping ratio can vary between mine types. For example, in coal mining the stripping ratio is commonly referred to as volume/weight.
