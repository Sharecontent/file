Olivine. Jewelers and birth-stone aficionados are familiar with the gem-quality olivine known as peridot. An olivine crystal is normally a roundish lump 2 mm or less across. A mass of pure olivine crystals thus forms a distinctive granular texture. Olivine's color ranges from the deep green of peridot to the olive green of olives to the pale

## Olivine | Encyclopedia
Olivine is readily altered to the mineral serpentine by the hydration of its crystal structure by hot (400 - 800 ° C) water. This process occurs along mid-ocean ridges and other places where mafic rock is exposed to superheated water. Peridot (pronounced PER-ih-do) is a transparent variety of olivine valued as a gemstone.

## Olivine: The Environmentally "Green" Solution to Climate Change?
The weathering (breakdown) of rocks is a natural process that locks up carbon dioxide in the air by chemical reaction. When magnesium-rich olivine reacts with CO 2 and water under natural conditions, it forms magnesium-carbonate and silicic acid. This process locks up CO 2 from the air into rocks with a new chemical composition.

Discovering the ultimate technique for sequestrating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, has become the main aim of numerous scientific teams. First, there were the soil scientists, then the geo-engineers, now it is time for the geologists to jump in. Researchers state that naturally abundant olivine might be the key to removing CO2.

The FENOTEC binder process is an alkali system and as such is one of the few chemical binder processes that is compatible with olivine sand. Other processes such as furan and PUNB are not compatible for use with olivine sand due to acid neutralisation with the former and uncontrollable rapid curing with the latter process.

Olivine is a common rock-forming mineral in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks, but it also occurs in impure metamorphosed carbonate rocks (picture below). It is a very common mineral in the mantle. Some xenoliths from the mantle are almost entirely composed of this mineral. Such a rock type is known as dunite.

Peridot has a pale yellow-green color and is sometimes called evening emerald or even mistakenly as chrysolite in the jewelry trade.Although relatively soft for a gemstone, peridot's beauty allows it to compete with harder gemstones like true emerald.

## What is olivine fracture? - Short-Facts
When magnesium-rich olivine reacts with CO 2 and water under natural conditions, it forms magnesium-carbonate and silicic acid. This process locks up CO 2 from the air into rocks with a new chemical composition. The weathering process that captures CO 2 is an important part of the carbon cycle but occurs very slowly.
