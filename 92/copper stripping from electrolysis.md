If pre-strip to loaded carbon at 40°C is applied, it is possible to remove copper with less amount of gold. In this way, the copper is removed from the system prior to the electrolysis process.

Gas Checks are so pliable that they are not matched as precisely to the caliber of bore as a round would be. This is because the process of installing the check to the round will swage it to the proper size. For example a .30 caliber gas check will work from .300 to about .315 so it will work on .30 caliber, 7.62, 308, and .303 British.

Pin Hole leaks are mostly caused by incorrect installation of plumbing pipes. For example, If a plumber uses a pipe cutter, to cut a pipe, it leaves a ridge on the inside of the pipe.

When current is applied to the electrolysis cell copper (II) ions in solution are reduced to copper atoms at the cathode. Copper atoms on the anode are oxidized to copper (II) ions. The cathode gains mass, the anode looses mass. When the experiment ends, the electrodes are dried and the mass of each electrode weighed on the mini-balance.

## Copper Pipe Electrolysis Corrosion Causes Water Service Line Leak
Electrolysis can occur when a DC electrical leak occurs underground. An electrolysis leak has been known to strike copper pipes, stray electric current is actually drawn to copper. Electrolysis can also happen when two different metals touch each other, this is also known as galvanic corrosion. For instance, if your main water line was repaired
