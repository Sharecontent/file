## Reverse Froth Flotation For Iron Ore
Iron ores and manganese ores are the main ones for which we use magnetic separation. Magnetite and Chromitite ores (both iron ores) use this method on a large scale to remove their impurities.  Research regarding iron ore flotation began in 1931, demonstrating that reverse cationic flotation is a very efficient method for beneficiating

Ore-type lithium ore generally includes spodumene, lepidolite, and feldspar. Flotation is the main beneficiation process for these lithium ores. Its technological process varies according to the type

## Beneficiation of a South African Wollastonite by Magnetic Separation 
This involved attempts to reduce the iron content by magnetic separation and to remove the quartz and calcite by flotation. It was found that magnetic separation successfully reduced the iron content of the ore from 1,5 percent to less than 0,3 percent after the samples had been ground to smaller than 200 micrometers.
