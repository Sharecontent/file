## Stoning in ancient greecees.shop
In ancient Greece, early gold and silver mining was carried out on the island of Siphnos (Herodotus III, 57; Pausanias XI, 2), but the amount of noble metals hauled from the mines was rather low. A much higher output could be produced in the gold mines on the island of Thasos and on the island of Samothrace, south of the Thracian coast.
