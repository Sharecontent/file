## Air pollution emission from the copper smelter Complex Bor in Serbia
Apr 8, 2021Serbian Bor Copper complex is a copper mining and smelting complex situated in the city of Bor, set in the mountainous part of eastern Serbia (Figure 1).  Due to the application of pyro-metallurgical processes in copper smelters, significant air pollution occurs with suspended particles. These particles contain high concentrations of Lead

## Toxic Air Pollution from Copper Smelters Challenged
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is failing to protect communities and the environment from toxic air pollution emitted by copper smelters, environmental groups argued today. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia heard oral arguments in a case (Docket # ) challenging EPA's inadequate regulations for controlling toxic air emissions from primary copper smelters.

May 4, 2021Copper mining firms worldwide are committed to reducing their carbon emissions. Freeport-McMoRan, one of the world's largest copper miners, lowered its carbon emissions by more than 21 percent from 2015 to 2019.  The transition away from coal has reduced air pollutant emissions by 6,000 tonnes—one million tonnes of CO2 - annually.

They replied that copper mining requires the use of large amounts of suphuric acid to extract the copper from the ores. Especially in high rainfall areas, this creates the phenomenon of acid mists and acid rains, that can fall many miles from the mine and smelters, causing damage to buildings, crops and most important, human health.
