## What Is a Ballast on a Boat? (For Stable Floatation & Easy Boating)
The water ballast sailboat effectively increases displacement against strong water or wind pressures by having a ballast keel. The concept of older boat ballasts like the year 1700 ship ballast types and those in sailboats are still relevant today. Before, larger boats even used stones or sand as a ballast keel for floatation stability.

Ballast water is routinely taken on board to control a ship's trim, list, draught, and stresses. According to IMO estimates, ships carry between three to five billion tons of ballast water globally each year. However, ballast water that brought onboard can contain thousands of aquatic or marine microbes, plants, and animals.

Good stone ballast is generally procured from hard stones such as granite, quartzite, and hard trap. The quality of stone should be such that neither it should be porous nor it flake off due to the weathering. Good quality hard stone is normally used for high-speed tracks. This type of ballast works out to be economical in the long run.
