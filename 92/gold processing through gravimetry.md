## Gold Processing Through Gravimetry
the gold contained in the ore. This process is made through the crushing plant, using jaw and conical crushers, conveyor belts and intermediate stockpiles. Gravimetry Carries out the separation of the thick gold through the physical process that considers the difference of density between the materials.

## Gravimetry - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Marine gravimetry came to existence as a standard gravimetric technique some 50 years ago, even though the first attempts were made even earlier, in the 1920s and 1930s, on board submarines (Vening-Meinesz, 1932).It was clear from the beginning that marine measurements could not compete with land measurements in terms of precision. At sea, the gravimeter is subjected to the accelerations of
