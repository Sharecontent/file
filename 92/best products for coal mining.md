## coal mining - Coal deposits | Britannica
In geologic terms, coal is a sedimentary rock containing a mixture of constituents, mostly of vegetal origin. Vegetal matter is composed mainly of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and some inorganic mineral elements. When this material decays under water, in the absence of oxygen, the carbon content increases. The initial product of this decomposition process is known as peat.

## Coal Mining Technologies - World Coal Association
Coal Mining Technologies. Surface mining of coal requires areas of land to be temporarily disturbed, which raises a number of environmental challenges. As coal mining is only a temporary use of land, a rehabilitation or reclamation plan is designed for each mine covering the period from the start of operations until well after mining has finished.
