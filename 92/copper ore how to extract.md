A centrifugal force is applied to the liquid inside, for faster separation. Grease Table or Belt: Uses the property that diamonds stick to grease. The ore is poured over this table and washed with water. A vibratory motion is given to the table. The diamonds with a few other minerals stick to the table while the rest is washed off.

## What is the process of extracting metal from ore called?
The process employed in the extraction of the ore depends on the nature of the ore and the impurities present in it.  Both iron and copper can be extracted from the ore by heating with carbon. However, iron is a more reactive metal than copper. It is therefore a little harder to extract it from its ore.

## Extraction Of Copper | Mining, Concentration, Smelting - Byju's
Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

## Extraction of Metals from Ores - Different Processes Involved - VEDANTU
The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.
