## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

Overview of a typical Iron Ore Process flow sheet: Primary stages of iron ore beneficiation, essentially, result in three iron ore product types, namely Coarse, Medium and Fine. Coarse Product. From the ROM stockpile ore is crushed and screened using gyratory crushers, grizzly screens and cone crushers before being sized through a sizing screen.

Almost 100% of mined iron ore is used in steel production, making it essential for everything from staples to buildings. Beneficiation is the term for reducing the size of valuable iron ore particles and separating them from the gange (unusable minerals), which are then discarded. There are several different methods of wet and dry separation.
