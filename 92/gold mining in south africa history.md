The story behind gold's discovery is still disputed. Jan Gerrit Bantjes and the Struben brothers unearthed gold on separate occasions in 1884. However, according to South African History Online, these were minor reefs and credit for the discovery of the main reef on Langlaagte Farm went to Australian George Harrison in July 1886.

## History - Pilgrim's Rest
The history of the Pilgrim's Rest gold fields dates back to ancient times when unknown miners worked the quartz reefs for gold. Alec "Wheelbarrow" Patterson struck it rich in a small stream, later named Pilgrim's Creek. The news sparked off the biggest gold rush of the time and in January 1874 some 1,500 diggers were working about 4,000 claims in and around Pilgrim's Creek.

Demand and supply. "The best estimates currently available suggest that around 205,238 tonnes of gold has been mined throughout history, of which around two-thirds has been mined since 1950. And since gold is virtually indestructible, this means that almost all of this metal is still around in one form or another.

Mining has a long history in Africa. In North Africa, people have mined for iron ores and other metals for more than 2,000 years.  Butte began in the late 1800s as a gold and silver mining camp. At the turn of the century, the development of electricity and the industrialization of America resulted in a massive copper boom, and Butte flourished.

## History of Gold Mining in South Africa - How to Find Gold Nuggets
Gold in South Africa was first discovered in the late 19th century by two prospectors in a place called Witwatersrand, which triggered the 1886 Witwatersrand Gold Rush. This gold discovery was a turning point in the history of South Africa. It led to the change of the country from a principally agricultural society to grow into the world's

## The devastating impact of Gold Mining in South Africa
For 130 years South Africa has been exploiting its gold resources in Johannesburg. But at what cost? 278 abandoned mines and 200 mining dumps, that contain about 6 billion tons of waste, exist in Johannesburg. For every single gram of gold extracted, 200 kg of waste are produced. Inside the city, hills composed of sand debris arise.

## Witwatersrand Gold Rush
The Witwatersrand Gold Rush was a major contributing factor of the failed Jameson Raid of 1895 to 1896, and of the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899. British resentment over the Boer control of the Witwatersrand resulted in the British owners of the mines organising the overthrow of the Boer government.

In a 2007 report, the Institute for Security Studies estimated that 10% of all gold mined in South Africa is stolen each year. Government estimates the value of the gold theft business at R5.6bn a year. Some estimates indicate that the numbers of workers involved in these operations now equal the numbers of those employed formally on the mines.

Mining in South Africa started when the first copper mine was established in the Northern Cape Province in the early 1850s. In 1867, the first diamond was discovered in Hopetown, after which diamond mines were established in Kimberley, also in the Northern Cape. Towards the end of 1870, gold was discovered outside Polokwane in the Limpopo Province.
