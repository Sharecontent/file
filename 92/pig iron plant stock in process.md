## How Iron is Produced - Metal Casting Institute
Pig iron (know also as Crude Iron) is an intermediate product of the iron industry, which is obtained by smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.8-4.7%, along with the dross silica pickup from the molding sand. The high carbon and and non-metallic inclusion contents make pig iron brittle and

Description. Pig iron is the intermediate product of smelting iron ore with a high-carbon fuel such as coke, usually with limestone as a flux. Charcoal and anthracite have also been used as fuel. Pig iron has a very high carbon content, typically 3.5-4.5% which makes it very brittle and not useful directly as a material except for limited applications.

## ore to pig iron to steel Discussion
Date: 11/14/17 14:03. Re: ore to pig iron to steel. Author: MThopper. These processes were carried out on one site, known as an integrated steel mill. The iron ore, coke and limestone were dumped into a blast furnace. The heat and gasses generated by the coke reduced the iron oxide (the ore) into molten iron.

## The production of pig iron from crushing plant waste using hot blast 
The process was started by washing process and magnetic separation of raw material as an effort to improve iron content degree from crushing plant waste. The next process was preparing the composite pellet with the particle size of −80 + 100 mesh and with the composition of 80% iron ore, 15% wood charcoal, and 5% bentonite.

## Construction to Begin Soon on $474 Million Ashtabula Pig Iron 
The plant design includes Tenova's HYL Energiron ZR technology and will convert 700,000 tons of iron ore pellets (shipped in via lake vessels) into 450,000 tons of premium nodular pig iron ingots. This niche commodity is currently imported by companies throughout the U.S. and elsewhere from a fragmented market in Brazil, Ukraine and Russia.
