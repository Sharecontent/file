## Development of Copper/Nickel Separation at INCO - OneMine
From the late 80s to very recently, the use of flotation columns, the use of pyrrhotite depressing reagents and the improved understanding of the complex mineralogy of chalcopyrite, pentlandite and pyrrhotite have considerably increased copper / nickel separation efficiency. Copper concentrate with more than 30% copper and less than 0.5% nickel grade is now obtainable at 80-85% copper recovery from mill feed compared to 70-75% copper recovery with 30% copper and 1% nickel grade only a few

## Nickel flotation for High Talc Ores - Strategic Met
Flotation of low grade nickel sulfide ores into a concentrate suitable for smelting, and at acceptable nickel recovery, can be challenging. Alteration of the gangue minerals can mean talc is present in considerable quantities. Talc floats naturally and can be very difficult to depress without significant nickel losses. High talc bearing ores have often been considered untreatable.

## Froth flotation
Froth flotation is a process for selectively separating hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic.  The chain is shortest in sodium ethyl xanthate that makes it highly selective to copper, nickel, lead, gold, and zinc ores. Aqueous solutions (10%) with pH=7-11 are normally used in the process.

## 60 Centuries of Copper: The Flotation Process
The Flotation Process. Until quite recently copper ore had to be hand-picked if the extraction of the metal was to be economical. In fact, in the last century, ores of 4 percent grade were regarded as almost valueless. Today such ores (which would be regarded as relatively rich in copper) are scarce; the great majority of mines contain the metal in finely disseminated particles which aggregate anything from 2 percent down to 1 percent or even 0.8 percent of copper.

## The selective flotation of pentlandite from a nickel ore
Nickel sulphide ores containing pentlandite, pyrrhotite and talc have traditionally been treated by bulk sulphide flotation, an approach which seeks to maximise nickel recovery and talc rejection but which does not reject pyrrhotite. Concentrates have therefore been of moderate grade containing as much pyrrhotite as pentlandite or more.
