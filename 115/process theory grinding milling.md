## Grinding & Milling: 2 Most Basic Machining Processes
Grinding is a subset of cutting since it is a true metal-cutting process. Every grain of abrasive used in the process functions as a microscopic single-point cutting edge — even though it has a high negative rake angle, and shears a tiny chip that's similar to a "cut" chip (turning, milling, drilling, etc.).

Theory and Practice for U. S. Stoneware. Fundamentally, milling is a process for reducing the particle size of solids to some required degree of subdivision. It is also a method for dispersion or mixing materials when grinding is secondary. Basically, a mill consists of a horizontal vessel whose length exceeds its diameter.

The milling process usually comprises of a few different operations but this depends on the shape of the final product and the state of the raw piece. Often, milling is necessary for giving a precise finish and adding a few features like slots or threaded holes. But it is also suitable for creating a finished part from a block of material.
