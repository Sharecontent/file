## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores. The great majority of gold is extracted from dilute ores using a combination of chemical processes.  The separation is achieved by passing chlorine gas into a molten alloy. The technique is practiced on a large scale (e.g. 500 kg). The principle of the method

## Ask The Experts - How do I recover gold in pyrite? - ICMJ
The best answer as to how to recover that gold depends on the amount of pyrite you intend to process. If you have only a few pounds, it can be roasted by heat in the open air and then mixed with a flux like sodium borate and melted with a collector metal like copper. The melt can be poured into a mold and the gold will now be alloyed in the copper.

## An Overview of Basic Gold Separation Methods
Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

Iron's melting point is around 500degC higher than that of gold (1538 Vs 1064). That can be used to separate them. Thermite reaction is one possible way to melt them. Alternatively, you can react the iron with something external as it is much more reactive or use aqua regia as it readily dissolves noble metals but only dissolves iron sparingly. 2.

## Selective separation of gold from iron ore samples using ion exchange 
2.3. Ion exchange separation procedure. The anion exchange resin Dowex 1X 4 Cl − in HCl medium could not be used to separate gold from iron in this kind of samples (iron ores) due to two reasons: the first one is that iron forms in HCl medium, the FeCl 4− complex which adsorbs on the resin, and the second reason is that AuCl 4− has stuck
