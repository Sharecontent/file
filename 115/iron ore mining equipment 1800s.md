Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.

## Iron Forge in Colonial America - Revolutionary War Journal
In 1608, John Smith loaded several barrels of iron ore and shipped them back to England to be tested for viability. The East India Company discovered that this ore yielded top-quality iron. In 1619, the company invested in Virginia iron and by 1620 it began building iron furnaces at Falling Creek, east of present day Richmond.

## Mining on the Iron Range | Minnesota Digital Library
The post-war years into the 1960s and 1970s saw decreased demand and the closure of many mines. Today iron ore is still mined on the Iron Range but in a much-diminished capacity. Iron ore mining has had a lasting impact on Minnesota and helped to shape the state's industrial and cultural identity.

By the late 1600's and early 1700's, iron ore was still being mined in Virginia and western Massachusetts. Small scale bloomeries, the most primitive form of smelting, reduced the ore into a porous mass of iron slag called bloom or sponge iron.The bloom was hammered into a low quality wrought iron by using hand held or large, heavy hammers powered by water.

The first ore shipped from the Vermilion Range was in 1884, the Mesabi Range in 1892, and the Cuyuna Range in 1911. The mines were operated through the hard work of the miners.
