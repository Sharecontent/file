## Mining all of the reef, all of the time
South Africa's reef deposits, especially gold and platinum-bearing ore bodies, are narrow and tabular. While legislation dictates a minimum operation height of 800 mm in areas where people work, some of the country's narrow reef mines have ore bodies with thicknesses of less than 500 mm, which results in ore dilution, as waste ore with zero economic value is also mined.

Quartz Reef Mining. Primary gold typically happens in quartz veins. The removal of gold ore from these tough quartz veins was traditionally referred to as quartz reef mining.
