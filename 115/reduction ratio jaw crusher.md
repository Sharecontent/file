## Introduction to Rock Crushers
Jaw crushers offer reduction ratios of up to about 6:1, while cone crushers can reduce material size up to a maximum of 8:1 ratio. The finer the crushing, the smaller the reduction ratio. As a basic rule, jaw crushers are the primary crusher taking the mined aggregate and reducing it to a size that a cone crusher can accept. Cone crushers tend
