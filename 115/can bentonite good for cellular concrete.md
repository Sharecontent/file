## Bentonite Waterproofing | What are the problems with bentonite 
Bentonite waterproofing is an exterior waterproofing treatment that is supposed to work by forming a barrier between wet soil and the building foundation. Like any type of clay, bentonite absorbs moisture. As water molecules bond to clay particles, the clay expands, filling cracks and gaps in the foundation so that water can't get in.

## Bentonite
Bentonite (/ ˈ b ɛ n t ə n aɪ t /) is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite (a type of smectite) which can either be Na-montmorillonite or Ca-montmorillonite.Na-montmorillonite has a considerably greater swelling capacity than Ca-montmorillonite. Bentonite usually forms from the weathering of volcanic ash in seawater, or by hydrothermal circulation through the

## Polyurethane foam concrete lifting equipment cost
Concrete Lifting and Leveling. Polyurea Protective Coatings. Simple Application. Since the foam cures in minutes—most solutions exhibit 90% of full compression strength after 15 minutes—large surface areas can be lifted and returned to service immediately during the application. This allows for swift construction and minimal waste.
