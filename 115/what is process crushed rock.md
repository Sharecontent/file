## Substation Grounding: Role of Crushed Rock - Voltage Disturbance
Application of crushed rock is a means of controlling step voltage and touch voltage. Step Voltage: During a fault condition, a person walking on the surface of substation can experience a voltage potential between his two feet (typically assumed to be 3.3ft or 1m apart). This causes a current to flow from one feet-through his body- to other feet.

## Difference between Pebbles, Gravel and Crushed Rock
Crushed Rock. Pebbles are naturally found near the river, creeks or seas. A similar looking substitute can be artificially produced by the process of blasting, crushing and screening. This turns massive deposits of rock into small sized rocks. Many call them as pebbles as well, but there is a difference in them:

The process is very similar to setting a fence post in dirt. You need to dig that one-third deep hole with your clam digger, then put a layer of gravel at its base. Put the post in the hole, make sure it's straight (again, this is ideally a two-person job), and then backfill with more gravel.

One way to do that is to bring the CO 2 to the rock—injecting compressed carbon dioxide into basalt bedrock, for example.

The tremendous increase in surface area when you crush up bedrock allows those weathering reactions to go much, much faster.
