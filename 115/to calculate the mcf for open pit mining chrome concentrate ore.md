## Chrome Ore Beneficiation Process | Chromite Processing - JXSC Mining
3.1 Chrome magnetic separation process. The chrome raw ore is a flotation tail ore, which is mainly formed in the chromite, and the chromite is the target recovering mineral. The dissociation degree of ferrochromium ore is low, and it has a weak magnetic property. First of all, magnetic separation processing to separate chromite.

## Open-Pit Mining | Method and Process | Epiroc US
Open-pit mining technology. Open-pit mining clearly offers a number of economic advantages over underground mining, especially now that mineral-processing technology has advanced to the stage where very low-grade ores can be treated profitably. 100 to 150 years ago, this was not the case, and mining was still much more selective.

Stripping ratio is the ratio of the volume of waste rock stripped off to the volume of ore exploited during the process of surface mining. It indicates the volume of waste rock required to be stripped for mining per cubic ore. Stripping ratio (see Fig. 1) is an important technical-economic indicator in open-pit mining, which reflects the

Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m).

The length of the shift is 480 min. with 3 medium length interruptions of each 30 min's duration. The estimate of costs can be made by including wages, ownership and costs per ton and ton x mile for energy and maintenance in the calculation. The operational availabilities pr shift were obtained from production reports.
