The single-line diagram provides the roadmap to enable proper design of equipment, redundancy, and protection. NFPA-70E requirements mandate accurate, up-to-date single-line diagrams. To meet these requirements, Vertiv can conduct a comprehensive site survey to develop single-line diagrams for your facility or to update existing diagrams.

LINE DIAGRAM IN STATISTICS. When the data vary over time, we take recourse to line diagram. In a simple line diagram, we plot each pair of values of (t, y), "y" representing the time series at the time point t in the "t-y" plane. The plotted points are then joined successively by line segments and the resulting chart is known as line-diagram.

## Cathode-ray tube
A cathode-ray tube (CRT) is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns, which emit electron beams that are manipulated to display images on a phosphorescent screen. The images may represent electrical waveforms (oscilloscope), pictures (television set, computer monitor), radar targets, or other phenomena. A CRT on a television set is commonly called a picture tube.

6. 6 Screening Equipment: Grizzly Grizzlies are used for rough screening of coarse materials and are most often found in crushing circuits. A grizzly is basically an inclined set of heavy bars set in a parallel manner. Coarse material slides on the inclined surface of the bars and material finer than the spacing between the bars falls through.

Lets go through a industrial single line diagram. When interpreting a single line diagram, you should always start at the top where the highest voltage is and work your way down to the lowest voltage. This helps to keep the voltages and their paths straight. To explain this easier, we have divided the single line into three sections.
