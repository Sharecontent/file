## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
5 days agoThe cone crusher breaks granite stone by extrusion. The wear and tear of the equipment wear parts is relatively low, and the wear costs can be kept to a minimum. Therefore, it has become a popular granite crusher with the advantages of wear resistance, large output and uniform cubical products, and is often used in the secondary crushing process. If the granularity of the granite feed is small, the cone crusher is also used in the first crushing process.
