The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). - This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. - As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.

## How to improve jaw crusher performance and productivity
Apply the proper jaw die profile. There are many kinds of rocks, differing in crushability, abrasiveness, flakiness, etc. Choosing the best combination of fixed and movable jaw dies profiles will help to optimize production when crushing difficult material. A Rock of low crushability requires a closer nip angle to keep the capacity as designed.
