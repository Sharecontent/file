## Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Beneficiation is begun with crushing and wet-grinding the ore to typically 10-100μm. This ensures that the copper mineral grains are for the most part liberated from the worthless minerals. This comminution is carried out with gyratory crushers and rotary grinding mills.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
The choice of the beneficiation treatment depends on the nature of the gangue present and its association with the ore structure. Several methods/techniques such as washing, jigging, magnetic separation, gravity separation, and flotation etc. are used to enhance the Fe content of the Iron ore and to reduce its gangue content.
