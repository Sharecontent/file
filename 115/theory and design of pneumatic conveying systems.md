The design and selection of a pneumatic conveying system involves consideration of numerous parameters such as the conveyed material properties, the conveying velocities and the conveying distance. Studying the relationship between these factors shows how changing one factor will change other factors.

##  Introduction to Pneumatic Conveying of Solids - AIChE
What is pneumatic conveying? Pneumatic conveying is the movement of solids through pipe using gas (usually air) as the motive force. It differs from hydraulic or slurry conveying in that the gas expands continuously along the pipe length. The flow regime in the pipe depends greatly on the ratio of solids to gas and the particle characteristics.

Pneumatic conveying system design may be based on previous experience or on test results. Unfortunately commercial interests dictate that manufacturers of pneumatic conveyors rarely publish information that could be of value in system design.

A system like this isn't always the best option. Here are some of the key disadvantages with pneumatic conveying: Lower Product Volume - Pneumatic systems are typically used for smaller volumes of material, with most pipe sizing ranging from 3-12". That's not to say they can't work for higher volumes.

## A Theory on the Operation of a Single-Tube Pneumatic Conveyor
The proposed physical and mathematical models are based on the continual approach in [3, 7] to develop methods successfully applied in calculating different pneumatic conveying systems, e.g., in [].According to the continual theory, in a homogeneous two-phase medium, the sizes of and distances between particles are incomparable with the dimensions of their confining space .
