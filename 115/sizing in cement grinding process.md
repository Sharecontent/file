Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early. Uniform kiln feed size helps reduce tendency to form kiln rings. WET VS DRY Grinding of Cement. Wet grinding is generally more efficient and permits a balanced feed direct to the grinding mill since a thorough mixing takes place during comminution.
