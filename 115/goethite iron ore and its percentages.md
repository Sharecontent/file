## How Do Iron-Ore Deposits Form? - Realonomics
The iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They are formed by the chemical reaction of iron and oxygen mixed in the marine and fresh water.  (most of the iron ore mined in the world comes from large deposits of massive hematite most commonly in a banded iron formation) Pisolitic goethite/ limonite. Banded metasedimentary ironstone

## Rapid and direct magnetization of goethite ore roasted  - ScienceDirect
1. Introduction. Goethite (α-FeOOH) ore is formed in terrestrial environment, as a result of oxidative weathering and acid soil formation.It is the one most common and abundant iron oxide and oxyhydroxide minerals in soils. The overwhelming part of these ores is represented by low-grade varieties which cannot be used in iron and steel industry without preliminary beneficiation.

## Goethite Uses - Crystal Benefits
Hydrated iron oxide, goethite, is a mineral located in soil and environment, that is low in temperature, and contributes to the main constituents of rust. With hardness ranging between 5.0 and 5.5 on the Mohs scale, its chemical formula is Fe 3+ O(OH) or HFeO 2.

## What Commonly Used Metal Is Extracted From Hematite
Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
