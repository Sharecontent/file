Appropriate management of solid minerals should translate or some say return Nigeria from just a minerals country to a mining country. Any industry that can generate high economic yield, income, technology and massive employment at the same time -even at the risk of price fluctuation and exhaustibility - is source of economic development.

## Why Nigeria needs to diversify economy through solid minerals 
In the year 2021, the mining sector as a whole contributed a total of 7 percent to Nigeria's GDP but less than 1 percent of it can be attributed to solid minerals activities. Presently, the solid minerals sector contributes 0.6 percent to the GDP of Nigeria while the government plans to increase it to only 5 percent in 2025.
