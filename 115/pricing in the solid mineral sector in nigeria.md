One of many solid minerals found in Nigeria, coal was first discovered in the country in 1909 in Enugu by a British mine Engineer, Albert Kitson. In Nigeria, Coal is found in Enugu, Anambra, Benue, and Kogi, etc. the Nigerian Coal is used as energy fuel and raw material for the metallurgical and chemistry industry.

Nigeria realised a meagre N496billion from solid minerals in 13 years despite the country's huge deposits, the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (NEITI) has said in its latest audit report. The amount is what accrued to the federation as revenue between 2007 when NEITI commenced reconciliation of payments in the solid minerals sector and 2019.

Appropriate management of solid minerals should translate or some say return Nigeria from just a minerals country to a mining country. Any industry that can generate high economic yield, income, technology and massive employment at the same time -even at the risk of price fluctuation and exhaustibility - is source of economic development.

## Why Nigeria needs to diversify economy through solid minerals 
In the year 2021, the mining sector as a whole contributed a total of 7 percent to Nigeria's GDP but less than 1 percent of it can be attributed to solid minerals activities. Presently, the solid minerals sector contributes 0.6 percent to the GDP of Nigeria while the government plans to increase it to only 5 percent in 2025.
