## Negative Impact of Coal Mining on The Environment - GradesFixer
Coal fires are caused when coal seams burn or when coal storage or waste piles burn (About Coal Mining Impacts, 2016). Coal fires can start by natural causes and forest fires but are commonly caused by mining accidents. Between 20 and 200 million tons of coal burn uncontrollably each year in China (About Coal Mining Impacts, 2016).

## researches on impact of coal mining on vegetation
From mining through final disposal of waste from coal-fired power plants, the use of coal produces a wide range of impacts on the natural environment and human health.Impacts begin with underground mining, which has long been notorious for its safety issues and health effects on miners as well as for surface subsidence (especially with longwall mining) and release of methane gases.

Here are some of the negative effects of coal mining and the burning of coal  It usually requires mountain blasting and the removal of trees and plants in the mining area. Coal mining increases the risk of loosening top soils into streams and waterways and the sediments pollute our water and can smother plant life downstream and even kill fish.

Coal mining often causes drastic changes in the soil profile and the loss of soil organic carbon and nutrient pools ( Indorante et al., 1981 ). As a direct result the soil system can suffer substantial and long-lasting damage, which negatively affects land productivity and ecosystem functionality ( Hartmann et al., 2014 ).
