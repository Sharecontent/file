## Eccentric shaft design of jaw crusher - Clirik
Jaw crusher eccentric shaft plays a quite important role in jaw crusher operating. The pitman is put in motion by the oscillation of an eccentric lobe on a shaft that goes through the pitman's entire length. This force is also put on the shaft itself so they are constructed with large dimensions and of hardened steel.

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
Introduced in 1906, McLanahan's Universal Jaw Crusher was one of the first modern era overhead eccentric Jaw Crushers. On the overhead eccentric style Jaw Crusher, the moving swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft with heavy-duty double roll spherical roller bearings. The swing jaw undergoes two types of motion: one is a swing motion toward the opposite chamber side (called a stationary jaw die due to the action of a toggle plate), and the second is a vertical movement due to the

## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The jaw crusher reduces the size of large rocks by dropping them into a "V"-shaped mouth at the top of the crusher chamber. This is created between one fixed rigid jaw and a pivoting swing jaw set at acute angles to each other.  The gap opens and closes by an eccentric drive on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical

The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action.
