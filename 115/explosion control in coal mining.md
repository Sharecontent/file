Queensland mines produced 242.2 million tonnes (Mt) of saleable coal during which was marginally down on production during . the previous financial year. This production was contributed to by 37 open cut mining operations, which accounted for more than 85 per cent of saleable production, and 13 underground mines. Full description.

Prevention. To prevent coal dust explosions and limit the amount of inhaled dust particles to reduce injury, limestone powder is sprayed along the walls of mines on a regular basis. In the event of an explosion, the surface limestone layer absorbs heat that is generated from the explosion to reduce its intensity.

## Causes of coal mine explosions | Peyton Law Firm, P.L.L.C.
The most common method to control methane levels in coal mines is ventilation. Methane levels in coal mines are supposed to be kept below 1 percent. Unfortunately, there are areas that are difficult to reach. Coal dust explosions in coal mines are usually caused by methane gas explosions. Dust must be very concentrated to explode.

The transfer points of the coal underground were the main point of the noise menace. The result of a noise survey for a coal mine conducted by Director General Mines and Safety (DGMS) is summarised in Table 13.1, which indicates noise over 90 dB by the drills, breaking and crushing units and transport system underground.

## Ventilation risks and controls
Frictional ignition can cause fire, gas or dust explosions. Its management should include: 1. Sharp Cutting Picks 2. Good sprays 3. Air velocities capable of eliminating accumulations of gas 4. Operators must trained and be vigilant. Regular revision of training for operators will assist in maintaining knowledge base. 5.

## Coal dust
Another means of preventing coal dust explosions is by placing rock dust in the mine, which is usually pulverized limestone dust, which absorbs thermal energy from the heated gasses. Rock dusting has been used since the early 1900s, but there have been technological improvements since then. [2]
