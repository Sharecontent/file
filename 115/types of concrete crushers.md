## What Kinds of Concrete Crushers Reduce Air Dust Pollution in a Crushing 
In general, all kinds of concrete crushers would produce plenty of dust when it is crushing the ore materials. The reason why it produces so much dust is that the material through the feeding port is crushed then being sent to the conveyor for the next process, during which a lot of dust with high concentration would diffuse around under the airflow.
