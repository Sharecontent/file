## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

History- Chemistry- Industries. Cement, one of the most important building materials, is a binding agent that sets and hardens to adhere to building units such as stones, bricks, tiles, etc. Cement generally refers to a very fine powdery substance chiefly made up of limestone (calcium), sand or clay (silicon), bauxite (aluminum) and iron ore

## Grading of Aggregates - Aggregate Grading - The Construction Civil
In grading of aggregates, the voids in the mixed aggregate would be minimum when the sand is just sufficient to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate. Voids in the coarse aggregate are filled in by sand and voids in the sand are filled in by cement. Mix that occupies the least volume is the densest and will produce the best results.

There are two main ways to design the concrete mix. Design mix method :- In this method, materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code . In this method, cement, sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight, and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.

Aggregates are inert materials which can increase the volume and alter the properties of concrete. In fact, aggregates occupy a large volume in a concrete mixture.

## Concrete Aggregates- Functions,properties, Characteristics and  - Happho
Aggregate is a granular material, such as sand, gravel, crushed stone used with a cement to produce either concrete or mortar. Aggregate is relatively inexpensive and does not enter into complex chemical reactions with water; it has been customary, therefore, to treat it as inert filler in concrete and mortar.

Only use clean water, sand and gravel. Aim for a mix of 1 part cement, 2 part sand and 3 parts aggregate. Mix the dry cement and sand, add water, mix, then add aggregate, and more water as needed. Cement mix should look gray, not brown, and water should not be freely running on top. Adjust the mix by adding more water, cement or sand as needed.

Made from limestone or chalk and clay, cement provides the adhesive component in concrete and mortar. It binds the other components - aggregate and sand - together and dries to a very hard finish. The most common form of cement is Portland Grey but there is a lighter variation called Portland White. Cement is sold in 25kg (55lb) or 50kg

What is sand aggregate? Sand aggregate is a general term for sand, gravel and other materials in construction projects. It is the main building material for concrete and stone masonry in hydraulic engineering, and it acts as skeleton or filling in concrete. It is widely used in civil engineering such as cement concrete, asphalt concrete, road foundation, railway track slag, and mortar.

Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.
