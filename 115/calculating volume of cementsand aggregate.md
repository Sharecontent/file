Apr 15, 2022Calculation of volume of aggregate in 1m^3 of concrete. Volume of aggregate = Ratio of aggregate / (Cement+Sand+Aggregate) x 1.57. = 3 / 5.5 x 1.57. = 0.86 m ^3. Now, assuming 1 cubic meter of aggregate = 1500 kgs (because the bulk density of every type of aggregate is different) Hence, 0.86m^3 of aggregate = 1500 x 0.86 = 1290 kgs.

Also Read: Volume of Hollow Cylinder. Step 1: Calculating the dry volume out of wet volume of the concrete. The wet volume of the concrete is 1m 3 to convert it into dry volume we need to multiply it with 1.54 (1.54 is the conversion factor of wet volume to dry volume of concrete i.e., Dry volume = Wet volume + 54 % of Wet volume) That comes
