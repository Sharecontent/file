## Crusher
The Blake type jaw crusher has a fixed feed area and a variable discharge area. Blake crushers are of two types- single toggle and double toggle jaw crushers. In the single toggle jaw crushers, the swing jaw is suspended on the eccentric shaft which leads to a much more compact design than that of the double toggle jaw crusher.

## The Most Practical Jaw Crusher Repair and Maintenance Manual
The lubrication of the interface between the parts of the jaw crusher is very important. It can minimize the friction generated during the operation, make the whole jaw crusher run smoothly, and extend its service life. Unlike gyratory crushers, the main lubrication used in jaw crushers is grease instead of oil.
