## The threat to Antarctica from mining and exploiting oil and gas
Any oil or minerals would need to shipped or piped out and then there's the problem of those vast icebergs again. Mineral deposits. Antarctica is known to have mineral deposits, though any sizeable deposits that are easy to reach are rare and even then not economically viable to mine. One of the main problems is the vast covering of moving ice
