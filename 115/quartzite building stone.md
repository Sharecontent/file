## The Definitive Guide to Quartzite - Use Natural Stone
Quartzite is a metamorphic rock made almost entirely of the mineral quartz. Quartzite begins its geologic life as sand grains, perhaps on a beach, desert dune, or riverbed. Over time, the sand grains become compressed and stuck together to form sandstone.

Quartzite Another metamorphic stone, quartzite is the result of sandstone after subjected to high temperature and pressure. The main characteristic of this stone is its granular texture and crystalline structure. Quartzite is brittle and hard, which does not make it easily workable. The crushing strength of quartzite is around 115 MPa.

## Quartzite - Unique Stone Concepts
Quartz Quartz is a man-made engineered stone surface formed by combining 90% ground quartz (a natural hard mineral) with 8-10% resins, polymers, and pigments. This forms a very hard granite-like surface. How it looks depends on how the quartz is ground: coarsely-ground quartz produces a flecked appearance while finely-ground quartz produces a smooth look.
