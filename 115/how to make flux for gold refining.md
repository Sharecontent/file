## flux
The borax method is a technique of artisanal gold mining which uses borax as a flux to purify gold concentrates By using borax no mercury is produced hence gold recovery increases History The process requires considerably less heat than conventional refining methods which can be obtainable even in remote locations using  Chapman Recipe Gold

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
1. Gold Processing. The first step in gold smelting involves processing the gold ore. The ore containing gold once mined from the earth is processed by separating gold minerals from the crude matter holding the ore together. The gold ore is then pulverized using pressure to create very fine particles.

Cupellation is a process that purifies ores by separating gold and silver from base metals and other impurities. The process makes use of a cupel - a high temperature resistant flat bowl. The ore is placed in this cupel which is put in a special furnace. Hot air is then passed through it to remove the impurities.
