Answer (1 of 10): A real-time system is a system where its correctness depends also on the time at which the computation is made (to better explain, you can put it in contrast with "normal" systems, where we are only interested that the result is correct). A rather old, but still good reference

A real time constraint is associated with a deadline. When you apply a real-time constraint to a system, it means that the system must respect certain rules and deadlines, in order to be executed successfully. Let's take a very basic example, which has nothing to do with robotics. Imagine you're given a challenge.
