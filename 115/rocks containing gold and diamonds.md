2 Rocks That Contain Diamonds 1. Kimberlite Rocks. The rocks are a type of igneous rock that forms when magma flows out of deep earth fractures. Magma existing in Kimberlite pipes pushes diamonds and other stones rapidly (a few hours) through the earth's crust and mantle. The rapid and violent eruption of kimberlite releases carbon dioxide and other volatile components. The rocks are found deep inside the mantle, within 150km to 450km. Through intense pressure, the formation of diamonds
