## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

Extraction of Gold using the Borax Process. The borax process is also an environmentally-friendly method of extracting gold. Here the gold-bearing rock material is placed in a melting crucible and then borax (sodium borate) is added. The borax sinks the melting point of the ore mixture and makes the molten mass more fluid.

## Methods to Separate Metal From Ore - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.
