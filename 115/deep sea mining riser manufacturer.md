## Deepwater Wonders of Wake: Deep-sea Mining: NOAA Office of Ocean 
Commercial deep-sea mining is presently in an exploratory phase, but is certain to occur because of the expected need for minerals that are rapidly being depleted from terrestrial sources. The deep sea is a rich source of these minerals, which can be found on the seafloor in the form of polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts.

Mining sites. Deep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process undergoing research which takes place on the ocean floor.Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 3,000 - 6,500 meters below the ocean's surface. The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain precious metals such as silver, gold

Polymetallic nodules containing minerals essential to energy storage lie at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. In deep-sea mining, a collector vehicle is sent to pick up these nodules from the deep seabed. The vehicle creates a sediment cloud known as a 'collector plume,' seen here in the foreground, that is then carried away by ocean currents.
