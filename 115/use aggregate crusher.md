Jaw crushers use compression between a fixed and swing jaw in an eccentric motion to force material through the crushing chamber. One of the disadvantages of the jaw crusher is that the aggregate it produces has a flat, slabby particle shape. For most construction applications, a rounder shape is more ideal as it has better compaction

A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
