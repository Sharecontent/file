## Occurrence of Metals: Metal Ores, Methods of Extraction, Examples
Metals of low reactivity level. Metals that aren't very reactive are placed low in the reactivity series. These metals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, Mercury is procured from its ore, cinnabar (HgS), by the process of heating. Copper can also be obtained from its sulphide ore (Cu 2 S) by heating.
