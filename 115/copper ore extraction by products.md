## Copper, Nickel & Chromite Distribution across India & World
Mining for copper is costly and tedious affair because most of the copper ores contain a small percentage of the metal. India has low grade copper ore [less than 1% metal content][international average 2.5%] The major part of supply comes from the USA, Canada, Zimbabwe, Japan and Mexico. Copper Reserves in India. 46 million tonnes. Rajasthan (50%)

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores

Sulfide Copper Ores . Virtually all sulfide-type copper ores, including chalcocite (Cu 2 S), chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) and covellite (CuS), are treated by smelting. After crushing the ore to a fine powder, it is concentrated by froth flotation, which requires mixing the powdered ore with reagents that combine with the copper to make it hydrophobic.

Bioleaching is the extraction of a metal from sulfide ores or concentrates using materials found native to the environment; namely, water, air and microorganisms. In other words, bioleaching is the commercialization of the ability of certain bacteria and archaea, found in nature, to catalyze the oxidation of sulfide minerals.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

Currently, the most common source of copper ore is the mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), which accounts for about 50% of copper production.The focus of this article is on the process of copper extraction from chalcopyrite ore into pure metal. Processes for other minerals are mentioned. For economic and environmental reasons, many of the byproducts of extraction are reclaimed.

Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores. Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes, which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore, copper oxide and copper sulfide, undergo two different processes, hydrometallurgy and

## Copper production & environmental impact - GreenSpec
Smelting and Extraction. Sulfide Ore. The dried copper concentrates are sent to the smelting operation where it is reduced and melted in several operations. At the end of this smelting process the copper is about 99% pure.. Oxide Ore. The copper-bearing solution is collected and pumped to the extraction plant where it is purified.
