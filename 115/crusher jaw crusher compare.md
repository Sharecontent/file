The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).

## Single toggle Jaw Crusher vs Double Toggle Jaw Crusher - Camelway Machinery
Jaw Crusher is the most commonly crusher used for primary crushing, it has two types Single toggle and Double Toggle. In the double toggle crusher the rotation of an eccentric shaft causes a vertical reciprocating motion of a component called a pitman that is translated by two toggles into swinging action of the moving jaw which is pivoted at its upper edge.
