## Hard Rock Gold Mining - JXSC Mineral
Rock Gold Mining Process. Compared with placer gold, rock gold ore has higher gold content and mining value, but the beneficiation process of rock gold ore is much more complicated than that of placer gold ore. Rock gold mines mostly use the flotation and cyanidation processes according to their characteristics.

## Finding gold ore - How much is gold worth? (part 1)
The value of the big rock gold specimen has an interesting tale. There are two cuts on the big rock to sample for gold to rock concentration. One cut runs in a particular direction and it yielded 33% gold for the lowest golds yield in the rock concentration. This is the small rock sample from that cut. It yielded a 33% concentration or ratio of gold to rock material.
