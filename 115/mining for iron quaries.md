Once you have iron ore, you can smelt them to create iron ingots. Iron ore is the only ore in Skyrim that smelts to ingots at a 1:1 ratio. Simply place your iron ore in a smelter to receive an equal amount of iron ingots, which you can then use for crafting and tempering. Like iron ore, many of Skyrim's merchants have ingots for sale.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
