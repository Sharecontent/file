The MSP Cone Crusher features one of the largest volume displacements by a crusher head. When there is a large volume of material displaced this way, it means that more material is crushed in each cycle, more material can be fed to fill the larger void left when the crushing head recedes, and more material flows through the crusher due to the larger throughput and gyrating cycles allowing material to drop further.
