## The Electrowinning Process: Part One | Total Materia Blog - Key to Metals
The Electrowinning Process: Part One. The electrowinning process is a relatively traditional method to recover waste metals through the rinse system and at the same time reduce waste water generation and chemical discharge. The most common metals recovered using electrowinning are gold, silver, copper, cadmium and zinc due to their relative value.

Hydrometallurgy is a technique within the field of extractive metallurgy, the obtaining of metals from their ores.Hydrometallurgy involve the use of aqueous solutions for the recovery of metals from ores, concentrates, and recycled or residual materials. Processing techniques that complement hydrometallurgy are pyrometallurgy, vapour metallurgy, and molten salt electrometallurgy.

The electrolyte commonly has Ag and Au concentrations in the 10 to 50 µg/mL range, while Cu, depending on the ore, may be as high as 500 µg/mL. The electrolysis process produces a metallic product containing Ag, Au, and Cu that is fire refined to dore metal.

Electrowinning is the oldest industrial electrolytic process. The English chemist Humphry Davy obtained sodium metal in elemental form for the first time in 1807 by the electrolysis of molten sodium hydroxide.. Electrorefining of copper was first demonstrated experimentally by Maximilian, Duke of Leuchtenberg in 1847.. James Elkington patented the commercial process in 1865 and opened the

## Gold And Copper Electrowinning From A Gold Plant Waste Solutions
Copper along with oil and gold are among the most traded commodities. . The copperbearing solution is collected and pumped to the extraction plant  pure copper cathodes using a process called solution exchange electrowinning (SXEW).  Waste rock is typically hauled from the mine site to waste dumps for disposal.

## Copper electrowinning from gold plant waste streams
Voltammetric tests allied to equilibrium diagrams indicated that for a free cyanide concentration of about 0.0115 M (300 mg/L), residual gold can be electrowon before copper from basic cyanide solutions within concentrations close to gold plant waste streams.Electrowinning tests with copper in a flow-by cell with a RVC cathode separated of the anode by a cation exchange membrane permitted the recovery of 99.6% of copper with the liberation of 99.4% of the cyanide as free ion for recycling.
