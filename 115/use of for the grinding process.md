## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

## Guide to Blanchard and Precision Grinding Process - CREATINGWAY
Blanchard Grinding. We use Blanchard grinding in finishing large portions of plate stock, die blocks, rotatory table and stampings. It is a process that arose and was named after the Blanchard Machine Company of Cambridge. This system provides a quick and uniquely cost-effective method for cutting away large metal shards over a large surface area.

Grinding is the process of removing metal by the application of abrasives which are bonded to form a rotating wheel. When the moving abrasive particles contact the workpiece, they act as tiny cutting tools, each particle cutting a tiny chip from the workpiece.
