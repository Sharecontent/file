Coal Reserves in India. coal sector, which has dominant use in three core sectors i.e. power, steel, cement. India has 4 th largest reserves of coal and holds about 286 billion of world's some 850 billion of proven reserves. Indian coal is classified in 2 categories i.e. coking coal and; non-coking coal. This is a usage based classification

Coal consumption in India, particularly in the electric power sector, is outpacing India's domestic production. From 2005 to 2012, India's coal production grew by only 4.7% per year to about 600 million metric tons while the country's coal-fired electric power capacity grew by a much faster rate (about 9.4% per year), reaching 150 gigawatts.

## Why Coal Reforms Are So Important For The Indian Economy
After nationalisation of coal industry in India, India never witnessed demand-supply gap until 1991. Soon after came the liberalisation of India with a clear impact on economic growth. In 1993, to focus on the increasing energy demand, the government decided to allocate coal mines to various players for captive consumption.

The coal stocks at its thermal power plants can supply just days of fuel. On October 1, the power ministry said that the 135 thermal power plants in the country had only an average of about 4 days of coal stocks left. This is worrisome because coal-fired plants make up nearly 70% of India's power source mix.
