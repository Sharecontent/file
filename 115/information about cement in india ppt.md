TYPES OF CEMENT Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC): The most commonly used type of cement, which is a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and most non-specialty grout. Rapid-Hardening Portland Cement (RHPC): These cements are more finely ground than OPC and strength gain ability is relatively faster than OPC.They also sets faster than OPC. Portland Blast-Furnace Slag Cement (PBFSC): It is an intimate mixture of finely-ground cement clinker and blast furnace slag to which a little gypsum is

What are the types of Portland cement - Majorly Portland cement produced by cement companies in India is classified into 2 categories, ASTM type of portland cement and ASTM type of blended cement Type of ASTM portland cements are as follows: Type I general purpose, Type II moderate sulfate resistance, Type III high early strength, Type IV, a low heat of hydration (slow reacting), Type V high sulfate resistance. The differences between these cement types are rather subtle.
