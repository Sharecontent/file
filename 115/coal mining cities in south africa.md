Air Pollution in South Africa. The two major types of pollution in South Africa are air and marine pollution. The industrial sector is the prime contributor to air pollution. More than 90% of South Africa's electricity is generated from the combustion of coal that contains approximately 1.2% sulfur and up to 45% ash.

## Mining towns and urban sprawl in South Africa - ScienceDirect
Introduction. Mining towns are a common phenomenon in South Africa. Historically, housing in these towns consisted of privately owned houses (exclusively for white miners, until the mid-1980s), company owned houses and, predominantly until the early 2000s, high density compounds for black miners. Today the mining towns are of various kinds.
