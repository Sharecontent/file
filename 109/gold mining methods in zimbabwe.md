The hand selection method is a sorting method based on the difference in color and appearance between lithium minerals and gangue minerals. The selective particle size is generally 10 to 25 mm, and the determination of the lower limit of the particle size depends on economic benefits. Hand selection is the earliest method of mineral processing

In this method, ore is mined in horizontal slices, starting from the bottom to the top of the stope. The broken ore is left in the mined-out stope and serves as a support to the stope walls and a working platform for mining the ore above. Shrinkage stoping has a high recovery but requires steep and narrow ore bodies.
