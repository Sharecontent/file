## Thermal Power Plants and Pollution - Ebrary
The regulations, issued by these agencies, specify the maximum allowable limits applicable to the pollutants discharge from the Power Plants. Effluents, in the context of pollution, are fluids, such as waste water and chemicals, smoke dust and solid/semi-solid materials like ash/sludge. These effluents affect the quality of the environment.

## India: Environment ministry allows thermal power plants to use high ash 
Environmentalists said that power ministry's claim is fallacious in several respects. Pollution control equipments in power plants are unable to capture fly-ash even now and higher ash content will mean higher emissions. Secondly, 100% fly-ash utilization is a distant dream and ash disposal remains a major problem, they said.

## Methods for Beneficiation of Ash and Slag Waste from Coal-Fired Thermal 
Abstract— Ash and slag waste (ASW) from coal-fired thermal power plants (TPPs), the amounts of which make several tens or even hundreds of millions of tons per annum, require allocation of large land areas for storing them. This waste is a source of pollution emitted into the atmosphere and it poisons the aqueous medium and soil. Ash and slag waste consists primarily of powderlike material
