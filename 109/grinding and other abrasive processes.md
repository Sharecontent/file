## Grinding Abrasive Process
High-efficiency abrasive process with CBN grinding wheel is one of the important techniques of advanced manufacture. Combined with raw and finishing machining, it can attain high material removal rate like turning, milling and planning. The difficult-to-grinding materials can also be ground by means of this method with high performance.

As with other machining processes, the surface roughness for grinding can be theoretically predicted by modeling how the abrasive cutting points on the rotating wheel surface kinematically interact with the workpiece.  If it were, diamond would be the most wear-resistant abrasive for grinding any metal, and silicon carbide would rank higher
