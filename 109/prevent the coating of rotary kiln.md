## Rotary Kiln with Reliable Functions | Fote Machinery
1. Advantages of Fote rotary kilns. The kiln body uses three forms of heating: calcining, sintering, and pyrolyzing to make even heat distribution. The equipment runs smoothly, and with a low failure rate and high operating rate. Fote rotary kiln can ensure high production efficiency, large output, stable product quality, and excellent performance.

Pulverized cement raw materials are charged from the top of preheater and charged into a rotary kiln after heat-exchanged with combustion gas. In the rotary kiln, raw materials react with each other under high temperature conditions and forms cement clinker that is discharged to the cooler. Cement containing around 65 mass% CaO is a basic material.

Refractory Degradation or Damage. A rotary kiln relies heavily on its refractory liner in order to operate efficiently and maintain the desired temperature within. Refractory is also what protects the shell of the kiln from the high temperatures within. Unfortunately, refractory liners will begin to degrade over time, causing a loss in kiln

The cylinder of the rotary kiln's main structure is shell, rim and thrust roller. Shell is the main part of the rotary kiln. It is a steel plate with a 40mm thickness, which is near rim. Because of the high load-bearing, the thickness near here is much thicker. There is a layer of 200mm refractory bricks in the inside of kiln.

Rotary kiln A Rotary kiln is a pyroprocessing device used to raise materials to a high temperature (calcination) in a continuous process.  In some processes, such as cement, the refractory life is prolonged by maintaining a coating of the processed material on the refractory surface.
