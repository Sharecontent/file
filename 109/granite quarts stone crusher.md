## Quartz vs. Granite Countertops: A Complete Comparison - Kitchen Infinity
Yes, quartz does scratch more easily than granite. This is because around 6-7% of quartz is man-made polymers and resins, so the overall material is less stable and tends to be a bit more flexible than granite. When you scratch a quartz counter, the flexibility of this resin can make scratches easier to inflict.

## Quartz and Granite: Which One is More Durable? | Marble
In terms of hardness, quartz narrowly wins with a Mohs hardness scale rating of 7, while granite typically sits at a 6. There are granite slabs that exist with a 7, however, in terms of their average hardness, quartz wins. While numerically one stone wins, there is actually not much of a difference in terms of durability between a 6 or a 7.
