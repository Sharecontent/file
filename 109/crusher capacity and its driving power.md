## What is the crushing capacity of the cone crusher?
The crushing capacity of a cone crusher refers to the amount of material crushed per unit time, usually in tons/hour. 1. The hardness of the material. The harder the material, the more difficult it is to break, and the more severe the wear of the equipment. The crushing speed is very slow, and of course the crushing ability is also very small. 2.

calculation of impact crusher capacity and power scmcrusher. The capacity of the crusher is determined by its size. The gape determines the maximum size of material that can be accepted. Maximum size that can be accepted into the crusher is approximately 80% of the gape. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 41 and 91.

A cone crusher can crush a variety of rocks, from medium to hard. The way a cone crusher operates is similar to how a gyratory crusher does, but in a cone crusher the slope in the breaking space is not as steep. Although it is known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, the cone crusher is better suited for secondary crushing.
