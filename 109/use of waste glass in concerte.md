## Glass Waste as Coarse Aggregate Filler Replacement in Concrete
Glass waste in the form of discarded glass bottles was broken into 5-20 mm fragments sizes and is used as coarse aggregates substitute in amounts of 5, 10, and 15%, respectively. The glass waste concrete samples were tested and evaluated for compressive strength after 7 and 28 days of curing to determine the concrete's strength.

The test results indicated that, compared with conventional concrete, the mechanical strength characteristics of concrete containing GP or GA were more enhanced. The use of GP decreased the deterioration of the concrete under the effect of frost action, whereas the use of GA had an adverse influence on the frost resistance of the concrete.

Basically, embedding any waste materials in concrete has two major objectives: reducing the environmental impact of concrete industry and eventually, enhancing some properties of the produced concrete. Glass is a non-biodegradable material and if not recovered and properly recycled, could negatively affect the environment.

## Use of Waste Glass as Coarse Aggregate in Concrete: A Possibility 
The utilization of waste materials (slag, fly ash, glass beads, plastic and so on) in concrete manufacturing is significant due to its engineering, financial, environmental and ecological benefits. Thus, utilization of waste materials in concrete production is very much helpful to reach the goal of the sustainable construction.

Besides powder, you can also use waste glass as an aggregate in concrete in the form of fine or coarse aggregates. Since aggregates occupy approximately 70% of the concrete, using glass cullet as aggregate in concrete does more than incorporate more waste glass in concrete. It also decreases the energy and time required to ground the glass
