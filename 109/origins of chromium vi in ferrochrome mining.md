##  Potential Toxic Effects of Chromium, Chromite Mining and Ferrochrome 
Chromium-III in water seems to be more toxic to fish than chromium-VI. It decreases reproductive success, can cause death at relatively low doses and deposits on the gills. Chromium-VI does not deposit on gills but enters the fish and exerts toxic effects on internal organs such as the liver and kidney.

Chromium (Cr) is used by different industries like ferrochrome, electroplating, and tanning industries, because of its hardness, coloration, and anti-corrosive properties. Chromium exists in various oxidation states in the environment, out of which trivalent (Cr3+) and hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) are generally found in aqueous medium.

## origins of chromium vi in ferrochrome mining
Ferrochrome can react with some acids with the evolution of hydrogen. Ferrochrome can react with molten alkalis with the formation of compounds containing chromium (VI). It is known that high temperature processes including production and welding of chromium and chromium-containing alloys can lead to generation of fumes containing chromium (VI).
