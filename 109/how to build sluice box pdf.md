Put down the sluice at a reasonable angle (perhaps around 5 degrees), and observe the flow. If it looks alright, feed it some sand and gravel and see how it flows through the sluice. Adjust the angle: Now you may try to adjust the angle of the sluice box to compensate for a too fast or slow flow.

## How Gold Sluices Work - Manhattan Gold & Silver
In the lab, this process is called "gravity separation.". Sluice boxes are designed to mimic this naturally occurring gravity separation. As water carries gold-laden sediment through the box, small obstructions called riffles block the free flow of material. These tiny flow restrictions form low pressure pockets where the gold collects.
