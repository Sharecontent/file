Great Applications Of Dolomite. Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, ideally CaMg (CO3)2. Dolomite is chiefly used as refractory, ramming, and fettling material in steel melting shops, and as fluxing material in blast furnace operation in secondary steel and ferromanganese manufacture.

## Steel manufacturing process pptht.shop
Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

## Burnt Dolomite - TRADEASIA INTERNATIONAL PTE.LTD.
Description. Brief Overview. Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg(CO 3) 2.There are two types of materials often called dolomite, a true chemically uniform calcium magnesium carbonate with the chemical formula CaMg(CO 3) 2, and a dolomitic limestone, which is just an irregular mixture of calcium and magnesium carbonates.

## Dolomite - Its Processing and Application in Iron and  - IspatGuru
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral. It is a double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (CaCO3.MgCO3). It is one of the important raw materials used in production of iron and steel. Dolomite contains theoretically 54.35 % of CaCO3 and 45.65 % of MgCO3 or 30.41 % of CaO, 21.86 % of MgO, and 47.73 % of CO2.
