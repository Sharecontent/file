With advent of novel technologies, mining companies are now figuring out ways to extract valuable metals from tailings. In gold, copper sulfide and iron ore tailings, the potential of extracting minerals is an opportunity. Reprocessing tailings to collect the valuable minerals can be a cost-effective approach compared to processing virgin material.

## Mine Tailings Disposal Methods - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Today, the universal disposal method for tailings is the tailing pond. Tailings are slurried with water and pumped to tailing ponds for settling. Frequently, tailings are cyclone-classified before deposition. Coarse sands are used to build-up the tailing dam, while the slimes are deposited inside the pond.

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.

What were the effects of hydraulic mining on the environment of the American West? During the U.S. gold rush, hydraulic mining operations in California completely denuded forested landscapes, altered the course of rivers, increased sedimentation that clogged river beds and lakes and released enormous amounts of mercury onto the landscape.

Due to the way minerals are processed, tailings can contain concentrations of processing chemicals. This can make mine tailings an environmental concern, so proper transportation and disposal are crucial. Consequently, the next step is to pump mine tailings away with slurry pumps into tailings ponds.
