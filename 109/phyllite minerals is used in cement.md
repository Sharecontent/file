## What is the use of phyllite? - MyWebs
Phyllite is a foliated metamorphic rock rich in tiny sheets of sericite mica. Phyllite is a durable and soft rock and used as decorative aggregates, floor tiles, and as exterior building, or facing stone. The other uses include cemetery markers, commemorative tablets, creative artwork, and writing slates. What is the characteristics of phyllite?

The minerals in a metamorphic rock are mostly well-formed, intergrown crystals. Minerals would not occur in sedimentary rocks in such uneroded, un-rounded, intergrown forms. In addition, many metamorphic rocks have grown distinctive minerals that are not stable at the surface of the earth. Gneiss is a metamorphic rock that may look like granite.

## Phyllite Facts
Phyllite is a fine grained metamorphic rock that resembles its sedimentary parent rock, shale. Shale can metamorphose into slate, schist, gneiss or phyllite depending on the degree of heat and pressure. Phyllite is typically grey in color and has a sheen from tiny grains of mica. It has a corrugated cleavage and easily splits into sheets due to the parallel alignment of platy minerals.

Phyllite is a metamorphic rock which forms when slate is further metamorphosed until very fine grained white mica attains a preferred orientation. Slate has fine clay flakes which is oriented but with the phyllite it has fine grained mica flakes that are oriented. Its constituent platy minerals are larger than those in slate but are not visible with naked eye.

Cement plants are typically located central to the minerals required to make the cement, which saves the transportation costs and reduces the price of the cement. Once the ore material to be used for cement has been mined, it is transported to the crushing/screening plant, where it is crushed and screened, to produce the desired particle size.
