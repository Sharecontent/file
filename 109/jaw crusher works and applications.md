## Jaw Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## how a jaw crusher works and what it is used for
A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

Automotive / By Joseph Mills / May 30, 2020. Jaw crushers work according to the principle of pressure reduction. The crushing of the crushed material takes place in the wedge-shaped shaft between the fixed and the eccentric shaft moving crushing jaw. Due to the elliptical movement process, the crushed material is crushed and transported downwards.
