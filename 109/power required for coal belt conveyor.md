## Stieber RDBK Backstops for Inclined Coal Mine Conveyors
With a maximum torque capacity of 180,000 Nm, a unique, compact design gives the RDBK up to 3.5 times more torque capacity than backstops of similar design; with up to 15 times more energy dissipation. The friction linings work in an oil bath to make sure that the unit remains functional after long periods of inaction.

I don't know what is used but maybe some logical thought will produce ideas. Coal is burning so -. 1) it gives off heat. 2) it gives off CO2. Maybe provide a thermal sensor (s) over the belt to detect burning, or maybe pass the carrying belt through a tunnel provided with CO2 sensors. These would monitor the coal for burning.
