## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
Mar 22, 2022Beneficiation process. Magnetite is the most important iron ore mineral. Cut-off grade is 20%, and the industrial grade is 25%. There are usually 3 magnetite beneficiation methods: (1) Single weak magnetic separation. (2) Weak magnetic separation - reverse flotation. (3) Weak magnetic-strong magnetic-flotation combined process.

The beneficiation of iron ore typically occurs in a liquid medium. In addition, many pollution abatement devices use water to control dust emissions. At a given facility, these techniques may require between 600 and 7,000 gallons of water per ton of iron concentrate produced, depending on the specific beneficiation methods used.

## Summary of Iron Ore Beneficiation Process and Technology (Ⅱ)
There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.

Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
