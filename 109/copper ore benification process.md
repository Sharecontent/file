Copper is mined either at open pit copper ore mines or underground copper ore mines. First the copper ore is blasted, loaded and transported to the primary crushers. Then the ore is crushed and screened, with the fine sulfide ore (~-0.5 mm) going to froth flotation cells for recovery of copper.In the primary crusher, the ore is broken into

## Copper Sulfide Ore and Flotation Process - JXSC Mining
1 Types of copper sulfide ore. (1) Single copper mineral Its ore characteristic is relatively simple, and the only useful component that can be recycled is copper. The gangue minerals are mainly quartz, carbonate and silicate. (2) Copper-sulfur ore Called copper-bearing pyrite. In addition to copper minerals, iron sulfide can be recovered, and
