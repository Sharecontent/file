## The Effect of Phosphate on the Properties of Copper Drinking Water 
Extensive localized or pitting corrosion of copper pipes used in household drinking water plumbing can eventually lead to pinhole water leaks that may result in water damage, mold growth, and costly repairs. Water chemistry has been recognized as the cause of some community-wide copper pinhole leak outbreaks. A large drinking water system in Florida recently switched from pH adjustment and

Around 6000 years ago the procedure involved heating copper ore in the presence of charcoal; we have created a laboratory experiment inspired by this idea. The experiment starts with a naturally occurring ore, malachite, essentially pure Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2, which is readily available at modest cost in bead form from jewelry stores.

## Is bronze jewelry safe to wearert-durch-elf
Raw Malachite is quite poisonous as it contains copper minerals in a very high percentage ( approximately 58% ). Copper is toxic to humans and it affects the formation of red blood cells and hence Malachite dust should not be ingested, inhaled, or left on the skin. This is the reason Malachite is well polished and cleansed before it can be used.

## Malachite
Malachite is a copper carbonate hydroxide mineral, with the formula Cu 2 CO 3 (OH) 2.This opaque, green-banded mineral crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system, and most often forms botryoidal, fibrous, or stalagmitic masses, in fractures and deep, underground spaces, where the water table and hydrothermal fluids provide the means for chemical precipitation.

## Solved In a Lab experiment "Isolation of Copper Metal | Chegg
In a Lab experiment "Isolation of Copper Metal from Malachite Beads": A malachite bead was first weighed at 0.55 g . It was heated for 15 minutes, allowed to cool, and then weighed 0.38 g. Then, it was placed inside a crucible and covered with charcoal, and heated for 90 minutes.
