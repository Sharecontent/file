Calcium carbonate is one of them. To avoid the impact of coal or oil prices on production of plastics, manufacturers use CaCO3. They mix this powder, additive s and primary plastic when making filler masterbatch or compound. The purpose of this action is to make final products replace for using 100 % primary plastic.

Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes
