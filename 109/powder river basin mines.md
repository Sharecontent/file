## Wyoming coal mine in Powder River Basin will stop operations - Buckrail
The Coal Creek mine produced about 2 million tons of its lower heat value coal last year, 73% less than in 2018. The mines in the Powder River Basin produce about 40% of the nation's coal, but production has declined in part because of a push for natural gas and renewable energy.

The area is known as the Powder River Basin and it is the largest coal producing area in the United States. The sub-bituminous coal is located near the surface which makes it easier and more cost effective to extract than deeper underground seams. The coal is extracted from large open pits mines by huge draglines.

## Powder River Basin Coal Mines Could Drastically Increase Carbon 
The coal mining expansion in the Powder River Basin is going to have an impact on worldwide carbon dioxide levels. As people across the globe try to work together to bring our carbon dioxide levels down, the 16 billion tons of potential carbon dioxide in the Powder River Basin projects would increase atmospheric levels of carbon.
