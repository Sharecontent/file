Engineering. Using same mix design, coconut shell concrete was prepared by replacement of conventional crushed coarse aggregate (CA) with waste coconut shell (CS). Coconut shell replaced conventional aggregate by 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% respectively (by volume) and the effect on compressive strength and density of concrete was observed. 2.

## A Study on the Utilization of Coconut Shell as Coarse Aggregate in Concrete
An optimum percentage replacement of coarse aggregate with coconut shell aggregate is determined from the study. Coarse aggregate made from coconut shells were used in proportions of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30% and 35% to replace coarse aggregate in conventional concrete. A constant water to cement ratio of 0.5 was used throughout the study.

Although coarse aggregate usually take about 30% of the overall self weight of concrete.
