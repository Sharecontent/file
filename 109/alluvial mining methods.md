##  Alluvial Diamond Mining Fact Sheet
Formal alluvial mining requires a considerable amount of material (called the 'over-burden') to be removed first to get to the gravel bed underneath, where diamonds are found. When diamonds are found on the ocean shore or on riverbeds, the gravel is removed and then taken to a plant where it is washed and screened for diamonds.

Edie Creek has been a historic gold and silver mining area since its discovery in 1926. Located about 5 km south-west of Wau, it was the centre of one of the first major gold rushes in PNG before World War II. Large amounts of gold have been extracted by both alluvial and underground mining. Brothers William and Stanley Royal found gold at Edie Creek in 1926.
