Aggregates with fines will need to achieve a minimum of 98% Proctor values to achieve proper compaction. However, with ASTM #57 stone you are unable to test using this.  Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates,

## Aggregate in Concrete - Concrete Network
Aggregates are generally thought of as inert filler within a concrete mix. But a closer look reveals the major role and influence aggregate plays in the properties of both fresh and hardened concrete. Changes in gradation, maximum size, unit weight, and moisture content can all alter the character and performance of your concrete mix.

## Effect of coarse basalt aggregates on the properties of Ultra-high 
The coarse basalt aggregate results in a decrease on mechanical strength, but the decrease degree is rather limited. With the increase of particle size of basalt aggregate, both compressive and tensile splitting strengths tend to decrease, from 144 MPa to 132 MPa and 9.8 MPa to 8.2 MPa at 28 days, respectively. •

## Basalt Aggregates | Breedon Ireland (NI)
Essentially, primary aggregates can refer to any granular material formed from a natural rock substance, in this instance basalt. Breedon produces aggregates suitable for use in ready mixed concrete, precast concrete, highway construction, drainage and asphalt.
