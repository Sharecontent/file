## Mining in the Philippines: Of disasters and regulatory failures - PCIJ
Even before colonizers stepped foot in the Philippines, Filipinos had been mining precious metals for trade and for show. The presence of copper, silver, and gold in the Philippine mountains was one of the reasons the Spaniards occupied the country, according to historians. Since then, foreign miners have been setting up shop to dig minerals.
