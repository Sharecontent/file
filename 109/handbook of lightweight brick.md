## Brick system offers lightweight alternative to conventional veneer
An engineered drainage plane removes incidental moisture. NewBrick is 12 times lighter than conventional four-inch face brick, weighing 2.45 lbs./sf compared to 29 lbs./sf. This weight savings means NewBrick is easier, safer, and faster to work with, especially for multistory construction, according to the maker.

## Lightweight Refractory Castable - RS Kiln Refractory Bricks
Lightweight castable has low bulk density and thermal conductivity, so it is also called insulating refractory castable. By bulk density, lightweight castable can be divided into semi lightweight castable (1.0~1.8g/cm3), lightweight castable (0.4~1.0g/cm3) and ultra-lightweight castable (less than .4g/cm3).
