A ton of sand is typically about 0.750 cubic yards (3/4 cu yd), or 20 cubic feet. Sand is assumed relatively damp, since adding water can increase or decrease the density of the sand considerably (e.g. if it was raining or if you dig up and leave sand under the sun so water evaporates).

## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand  - CivilNotePpt
Solution: In case of M10 concrete, the ratio of cement, sand and aggregate is 1 : 3 : 6. Dry volume of concrete = wet volume of concrete × 1.54. Hence, the dry volume of concrete is = 3 × 1.54 = 4.62 m 3. The required quantity of cement is = (Cement ratio ÷ Sum of all ratio) × Total volume of concrete = = 0.462m 3.

Cement : Sand : Aggregate (in Kgs) is 50 kgs : 115 kgs : 209 kgs (by weight) Water required for the mixture = 27.5 kgs. Total weight of concrete ingredients = 50+115+209+27.5 = 401.5 say 400 kg. Density of concrete = 2400 kg/cum. So, 1 bag of cement produces = 400/2400 = 0.167 cum.

## Calculate Quantities of Materials for Concrete -Cement, Sand, Aggregates
Thus, the quantity of cement required for 1 cubic meter of concrete = 0.98/0.1345 = 7.29 bags of cement. The quantities of materials for 1 m3 of concrete production can be calculated as follows: The weight of cement required = 7.29 x 50 = 364.5 kg. Weight of fine aggregate (sand) = 1.5 x 364.5 = 546.75 kg.

In this regard, "how many tons in a yard of gravel?", it's depends on wet and moist condition and density of gravel, for estimating purpose, generally a cubic yard of gravel weighs around 3000 pounds and 1 ton or tonne is equal to 2000 pounds, so number of tons in a yard of gravel such as 3000/ 2000 = 1.5 tons, hence there are 1.5 tonnes or tons in a yard of gravel.
