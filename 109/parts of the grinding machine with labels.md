## Drilling Machine: Definition, Parts, Types, and Operations (With PDF 
Drilling Machine Definition: Drilling is a material-removing or cutting process in which the tool uses a drill bit to cut a hole of circular cross-section in solid materials. This is the most common machining process, one estimate is that 75% of all metal cutting material removed comes from the drilling operation.
