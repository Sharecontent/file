## How to improve the screening efficiency of the vibrating screen | Haiside
Sep 8, 2021At the same time, when selecting the screen surface, it is necessary to satisfy that the screen surface has a reasonable aspect ratio, which can improve the efficiency of the vibrating screen without affecting the screening capacity. 2. Adjust the feeding mode. If the feed is insufficient during the screening process, the ore will be unevenly
