Lime is a mineral made by heating limestone or dolomite in a kiln. Lime is used in a variety of chemical industries, in sugar processing plants, in steel mills, sewage treatment plants, and at paper mills. "Burned" or kilned limestone was also used as plaster and mortar in the homes of early settlers, and even into the mid-20th century.

What is Dolomitic Limestone. Dolomitic Limestone has been around for a very long time and has gone through many name changes over the years. Dolomitic Limestone was originally known as "Magnesium Limestone," as it contains high levels of magnesium instead of just calcium. So just about anyone who can use magnesium should be interested in it.
