## Why gold loves arsenic - Canadian Mining Journal
Jul 8, 2021They found that when the minerals are enriched with arsenic, gold can enter mineral structural sites by directly binding to arsenic, forming, chemically speaking, Au (2+) and As (1-) bonds. This process allows gold to be stabilized in the mineral. However, when the arsenic concentration is low, gold doesn't enter the mineral structure but

## Sulfuric Acid Baking—Water Leaching for Gold Enrichment and Arsenic 
During the roasting of gold concentrate to improve gold recovery, arsenic is released into the air and valuable elements such as Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb are converted into oxide minerals. In this research, we evaluated the release of As and the loss of valuable metals during the acid baking and hot water leaching processes used for gold concentrate. The acid bake tests were conducted for gold

Gold ores are considered refractory if gold extractions from a conventional cyanidation process are less than 80% even after fine grinding. 1) Arsenic-bearing refractory gold ore has stones extremely difficult to deal with. In the stones, gold is locked up in arsenic mineral matrix as the form of microscopic or submicroscopic lattice.

Environmentally; during or after detox, the arsenic can be precipitated via ferric sulphate leaching to produce the highly insoluble ferric arsenates which will settle, sometime requires the use of flocculant, in the tailings pond. Leaching at lower pH values (10 rather than 11) will reduce the solubility of these minerals in a cyanide solution.
