The process includes the reuse of scrap metal, water, and energy, as well as the production of advanced steel products. A large percentage of co-products is recycled, such as food cans. In addition, the recycled material is magnetic, which makes it easy to separate from other metals. This is why it is used in so many everyday products.

## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
In the industrial process, the maximum temperatures reached in the solid phase during the drying steps are approximately 300°C. After drying, pellets undergo firing steps, at which temperatures may reach 1350°C. In these steps, the roasting of all pellets components (ore, limestone, binders, etc.) occurs, liberating chemically bonded water
