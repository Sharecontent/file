Crushing is accomplished by compression of the ore against rigid surfaces or by impact against surfaces in a rigidly constrained motion path. Crushing is the first mechanical stage in the process of comminution. Stages of crushing: Primary crushing → Run-of-mine ore (ROM) reduced to 10-20 cm (4"-8"), ( " = inch = 2.54 cm)

Crushed stone and slag are filtered out per crusher/sorter, with actual ore being sent to furnaces. Crushed Stone and slag are eventually sent to chem plants to turn into slurry to get rid of it. Four chem plants making slurry can get rid of 50k crushed stone in a very short time, which will also give you a little more ore.

Alluvial gold ore refers to the ore formed by the primary gold deposit that has been deposited by weathering, separation and transportation after various geological effects. Its main component is quartz, and the particle size is generally less than 50-100 microns. The structure is loose, and it does not need to be crushed and ground.

Bauxite Used for Aluminum Production . Bauxite is the principal ore of aluminum. The first step in producing aluminum is to crush the bauxite and purify it using the Bayer Process. In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite .

## Crushed ore agglomeration and its control for heap leach operations 
Crushed ore agglomeration has two major aims. First, it is the best opportunity for the thorough application of the leaching solution prior to building the heap and "kick starting" the leaching process itself ( Bouffard, 2005, Dhawan et al., 2012a, Kodali et al., 2011a, Purkiss and Anthony, 2004 ).

Generally, the coarse ore tends to stay on the outside of the piles and fine materials tend to remain as an inner core as shown in Fig. 1.  (Lewandowski and Kawatra, 2009a, Moats and Janwong, 2008, Pietsch, 2002). Whereas, in crushed ore agglomeration, adhesion

## Exposure of minerals in crushed ore and metal contents of concretions 
1. From data on the chemical analysis, of ores and concentrates and the values of the constants β min and τ for nonmetalliferous minerals the authors have determined the exposure of the minerals being extracted in the original crushed ore and have calculted the content of metal (element) in their concretions extracted into a like concentrate in the beneficiation of magnetite, titanomagnetite

## Copper Concentrates - Cargo Handbook - the world's largest cargo 
The production of concentrates implies the crushing and later milling of the ore down to a particle size allows releasing copper by flotation. The concentrates from different regions have approximately between 24% up to 36% of copper. Copper concentrates are then submitted to a final filtration and drying process to decrease the humidity to 8-9%.
