Ball Mill Drives. These large coal crushing drive systems are usually rotated by motor-driven gearing. A typical application consists of a motor-driven primary single-stage reducer that, through a flexible coupling, drives a large open pinion which in turn, meshes with a large ball mill ring (girth) gear that is attached directly to the ball mill.
