## Flocculation in Mineral Processing | SpringerLink
Flocculation is a characteristic property of colloidal dispersions. The typical classical sol contained sub-microscopic dispersed particles which would pass freely through ordinary filter-paper, and were too small to be resolved by any transmission optical microscope. Consequently, an arbitrary size limit of 0.1 μm could be defined as the upper size boundary of the colloidal range.

Concentration. Concentration involves the separation of valuable minerals from the other raw materials received from the grinding mill. In large-scale operations this is accomplished by taking advantage of the different properties of the minerals to be separated. These properties can be colour (optical sorting), density (gravity separation
