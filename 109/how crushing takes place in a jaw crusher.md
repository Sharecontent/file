## Jaw Crusher - ScienceDirect
The mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers. The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.

## Crusher
A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw, moves back and forth relative to it, by a cam or pitman mechanism, acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker. The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.
