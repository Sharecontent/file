## Density of Aggregate - Bulk and Relative Density - Civil Engineering
If the volume is unit then, Bulk Density= Mass. Unit in kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3. In this definition, the volume is that contains both the aggregates and the voids between aggregates particles. The approximate bulk density of aggregate that is commonly used in normal-weight concrete is between kg/m3 (75-110 lb/ft3) .

## Bulk Density of Aggregate - CivilNotePpt
The bulk density of an aggregate may be defined as the mass of the material in a given volume. It depends on how densely the aggregate is packed. The other factors affecting the bulk density are the particle size & shape, the grading of the aggregate and moisture content. Bulk density of aggregate is generally expressed as kg/litre.
