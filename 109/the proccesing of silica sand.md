## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

## SILICA SAND - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Quartz sand, ground glass of any color, or quartz rock will do just fine for that kind of work. FYI -- For a few bucks. You can also go over to your local big box hardware store and purchase a 100 pound bag of 30 or 100 mesh sand from the cement and brick aisle. The active ingredient is the silicon dioxide, or SiO2.
