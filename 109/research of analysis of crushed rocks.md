## Defining the suitability of new crushed rock aggregate  - SpringerLink
This study evaluated the current crushed rock aggregate resources and defined the suitability of potential crushed rock aggregate resource areas in the north of Kocaeli Province by using the geographical information system (GIS). Evaluation of the current aggregate market showed that almost 80 % of the total annual production (14.35 million tonnes) is supplied by the quarries located in Gebze

## Substation Grounding: Role of Crushed Rock - Voltage Disturbance
Application of crushed rock is a means of controlling step voltage and touch voltage. Step Voltage: During a fault condition, a person walking on the surface of substation can experience a voltage potential between his two feet (typically assumed to be 3.3ft or 1m apart). This causes a current to flow from one feet-through his body- to other feet.

## Research on Mechanical Characteristics of Asphalt Graded Gravel Layer 
The discrete element analysis software is used to establish a simulation model including sleepers, subgrade, and asphalt graded gravel. Based on the longitudinal resistance-displacement data of the ballast bed measured in the in situ test, the two-dimensional sleeper-ballast discrete element model in this article is established in full scale according to the "High-speed Railway Design Code
