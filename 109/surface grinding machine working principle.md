## Bench Grinders; Working, Hazards, and Mitigation
A bench grinder is a type of grinding machine that is used to drive abrasive wheels. The difference between other grinding machines (die grinder or angle grinder) and bench grinder is that it is mounted on a bench or a table. These tools are used to sharpen cutting tools like chisels, drill bits, tool bits, and many more.
