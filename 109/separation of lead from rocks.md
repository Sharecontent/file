## Separation of clay minerals from carbonate rocks by using acid
The limestone or dolomite is treated at room temperature with acetic acid (less than 0.3 molar) or hydrochloric acid (0.11 molar). The weaker the acid concentration the greater the possibility that the clay minerals will be unchanged. Some carbonate rocks must be present throughout the period of acid treatment.

Separation of lead ions from aqueous solutions containing 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 ppm lead was studied by adsorption at the surface of talc mineral of Indian origin. The effect of temperature (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70"C) on adsorption phenomena was studied and the data was analyzed using Langmuir isotherm. The changes in enthalpy (AH), free energy (AG) and entropy (AS) were evaluated.

Lead chloride is much more soluble in hot water than silver chloride. Leach the mixed chlorides with boiling water, let it cool and pour it off the PbCl2 crystals, reheat the water and use it again for another extraction. Repeat several times, until the weight of lead chloride is 3/4 or so of what you'd expect for 100% lead as the starting metal.
