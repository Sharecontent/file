Copper Ore. Copper ore is a mineral form in which copper is mainly in the form of compounds and a few in the form of elemental substances. There are more than 200 kinds of copper-bearing ores in nature. Common copper ores can be divided into three types: natural copper, sulfide ores and oxide ores.

## Copper Processing | Multotec
The physical removal process of copper is dependent on the type of ore (either oxide or sulphide ores). These kinds of ores have different extraction processes, as explained in detail below. Extraction of Copper from Oxide ores: When working with oxide ores, a hydrometallurgical leaching process is typically utilised. This process makes use of

## USA - Method for producing copper oxide - Google
A method for producing copper oxide. In the method, a copper bearing material, aqueous ammonia, and a sufficient amount of an ammonium salt to double the rate of production of copper oxide in the absence of the salt are placed in a single vessel. The vessel is closed, and oxygen is fed into the vessel. The mixture is stirred and heated to a temperature of between approximately 70° and 130° C
