## Pelletizing Plants | BOLLFILTER
Pelletizing is the process through which iron ore fines are transformed into an agglomerated form called "iron ore pellets" suitable for use in an iron-making furnace at a steel mill, such as a blast furnace or electric arc furnace. In its end product form, a typical iron ore pellet is roughly spherical in shape, measuring from 6 mm to 16
