aluminium industry is practised for many years now. Because of its close similarity in atomic radii with aluminium, gallium is invariably associated with bauxites to the extent of 0.002 to 0.005%. During the working cycle of aluminium, (Bayer process-digesting bauxite with alkali) gallium is taken into sodium alaminate solu- tion as sodium gallate.
