## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Limestone: A sedimentary rock that is the most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. One of the most versatile rocks for construction, limestone is able to be crushed easily making it a primary rock used in ready-mix concrete, road construction, and railroads. It is widely available in quarries across the country.

Conclusion. The results of mix design indicate that crushed sand can also make as good a concrete as that made of natural sand.The compressive strength obtained is same as of normal mixes.In fact use of crushed sand will become inevitable in near future because of dwindling sources of natural sand.

Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
