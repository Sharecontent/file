## Compressive Strength of Concrete after 7 and 28 days
The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. The compressive strength is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine.  Compressive strength results are primarily used to determine that the concrete mixture as delivered on site

## Splitting Tensile Strength of Concrete - Civil Engineering Forum
Tensile strength of concrete is much lower than its compressive strength (that's why steel is used to carry the tension forces). It has been estimated that tensile strength of concrete equals roughly about 10% of compressive strength. To determine the tensile strength, indirect methods are applied due to the difficulty of the direct method.

For concrete blocks, the compressive strength is typically around 17.5 N/mm2 or 2500 psi. This means that the blocks can support a load of up to 17.5 N per square millimeter before they start to crack. Compressive strength is tested to determine how much compression a concrete block structure can endure.

CS = F ÷ A, where CS is the compressive strength, F is the force or load at the point of failure and A is the initial cross-sectional surface area. Compressive strength is measured in psi (pounds per square inch). The higher the psi the stronger, and consequently more expensive the concrete is. The minimum psi required depends on the project

The stress has to be transferred somehow from the concrete to reinforcing material. This is where Fig 6 comes in. If there is a reinforcing nail or bar in the concrete as it sets, the concrete will shrink around the bar and indoing so will grip the bar very very tightly as shown in the right hand part of Fig6.

Example - If the concrete grade is M20, then the individual crushing value should not be less than 15 N/Sqmm. The individual crushing value difference between the cube should not be

## Compressive Strength of Cement | The Construction Civil
This test is carried out to determine the compressive strength of cement. Test Procedure for compressive strength of cement: (i) The mortar of cement and sand is prepared. The proportion is 1:3 which means that (X) gm of cement is mixed with 3(X) gm of sand. (ii) The water is added to the mortar. The water cement ratio is kept as 0.4 which

## How to Calculate Rate of Loading for Concrete Cube Testing in  - Civil4M
Cube size is 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm. So total load on this surface area will be. 1.373 x 10 x 10 = 137.3 Kn. So rate of loading will be = 137.3 / 60 = 2.88 Kn/Sec. Same way you can calculate rate of loading for each cube size you test at your laboratory.

## Compressive strength of cement and cement mortar cube test
Compressive strength of cement is determined by cube test on cement mortar cubes compacted by means of a standard vibration hydraulic machine. Standard vibration for making cube is 12000 +- 400 vibration per minute and it will vibrate for 2 minute.  Sir How to calculate weight of water add in prepare Mortar cube of cement. Reply.
