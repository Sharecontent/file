Thermal power plants use different types of coal pulverizers. The method used is attrition, impact, or a combination of both. This article explains the characteristics of the three main types- attrition, impact and attrition, and impact or hammer. Selection of the type of pulverizer depends on the grindability of the coal, the capital costs and maintenance costs, and considerations for licensing.
