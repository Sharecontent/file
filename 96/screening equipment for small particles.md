## News in screening and separation for bulk solid materials • Innovations
The separation of bulk solids is mainly done through one of the following methods: air classification, screening, sieving gravity, and magnetic separation. Examples of separation processes include those operations that attempt to isolate specific material fractions based on their particle size. But also operations like scalping coarse fraction

## DEM study of particles flow on an industrial-scale roller screen
Fig. 1 shows the configuration of the industrial-scale roller screen. Table 1 gives the geometrical and operational parameters used in the simulations. The roller screen mainly consists of a frame supporting the whole device, rollers with shaped discs screening particulate materials, motors providing rotation force, sidewalls holding the rollers, dust cover preventing the small particles
