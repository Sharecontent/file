## NR Construction and Demolition (C&D) Waste Reduction
C&D waste often contains bulky, heavy materials, such as concrete, wood, metals, glass, and salvaged building components. [1] Demolition accounts for more than 90% of C&D waste and construction represents less than 10% [2]; therefore, the concept of deconstruction is also important to consider. Deconstruction is the practice of disassembling a

## Leaching Behaviour of Construction and Demolition Wastes and  - MDPI
Construction and demolition wastes represent a primary source of new alternative materials which, if properly recovered, can be used to replace virgin raw materials partially or totally. The distrust of end-users in the use of recycled aggregates is mainly due to the environmental performance of these materials. In particular, the release of pollutants into the surrounding environment appears

## Construction and Demolition Wastes | SpringerLink
By its nature, the vast majority of construction and demolition (C&D) waste derives from demolition. The demolition of a structure is typically a destructive process, regardless of what technique is employed, meaning that the resulting rubble consists of a complex mixture of a range of different materials.

## Construction and demolition waste - Civilsdaily
Construction and Demolition Waste Management - Concerns. In spite of th e aforementioned, industry and state pollution control boards operate poorly. In India, between 25 and 30 million tonnes of C&D waste are produced each year, but barely 5 percent of it gets treated. It is noteworthy that dirt, sand, and gravel make up 36% of C&D waste.

## Sustainable reverse logistic of construction and demolition wastes in 
It is thus necessary to understand the dynamic of the building sector. Another challenge is to improve the management of construction and demolition wastes (C&DW) where the dwelling sector injects important waste flows. Indeed, the European waste framework directive (2008/98/CE) targets a 70% of recycling rate from the C&DW by 2020 .

While retrievable items such as bricks, wood, metal, titles are recycled, the concrete and masonry waste, accounting for more than 50% of the waste from construction and demolition activities, are not being currently recycled in India.
