Soapstone is made up of mineral deposits created by nature and quarried from the earth. The main mineral components in soapstone include talc, chlorite, dolomite and magnesite, giving a warm, soft feeling to the touch. Soapstone has a unique soft color with light flowing veins. When cut, it oxidizes from light grey to dark charcoal in color.
