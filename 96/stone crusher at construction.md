## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
Crushed stone did not become a staple in construction until after WW2 for a simple reason: The equipment did not exist to crush or move stone efficiently. Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed.

## What are Construction Crushers? How Construction Crusher Works?
The crushing mechanism holds the material to be crushed between solid surfaces. A force is applied that brings the surfaces close to each other. Energy is generated within the materials to be crushed, and cause the separation of the molecules. The ancient crushers were stones held by hands. The stone weight enhanced the human energy being used.
