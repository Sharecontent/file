Titaniferous magnetite in the Laramie Range forms one of the largest deposits of this type in North America. The titaniferous magnetite is distributed in more than 30 separate deposits of disseminated and massive magnetite-ilmenite (Dow, 1961). Many of these occupy the crest of an antiform in the Laramie anorthosite complex (Hagner, 1968).

Titanomagnetite is a mineral containing oxides of titanium and iron, with the formula Fe 2+ (Fe 3+,Ti) 2 O 4.It is also known as titaniferous magnetite, mogensenite, Ti-magnetite, or titanian magnetite. It is part of the spinel group of minerals. The Curie temperature for titanomagnetite has been found to have a wide range of 200 to 580°C.. It is can be found in association with zircon
