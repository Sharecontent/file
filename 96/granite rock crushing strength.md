The crushing-strength test is not practiced as a rule except on stone intended for building purposes. The fact is that most rocks have adequate compressive resistance for structural purposes. Crushed stone does not lend itself to the compression test very readily unless the sample is taken from the ledge rock before it is crushed.

## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
3 days agoTaking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.
