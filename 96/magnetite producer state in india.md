## Magnetite
Magnetite is a mineral and one of the main iron ores, with the chemical formula Fe 2+ Fe 3+ 2 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron, and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself. With the exception of extremely rare native iron deposits, it is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.

What is the slag formed during the industrial production of iron? 2 Blast furnace slag.Blast furnace slag (BFS) is a by-product from iron production in blast furnaces, which are fed by a mixture of iron-ore, coke and limestone. In the process, the iron ore is reduced to iron while all remaining materials form the slag, which is tapped off as a molten liquid and cooled.
