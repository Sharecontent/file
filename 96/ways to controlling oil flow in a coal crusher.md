## Crusher Lubrication System Operation & Maintenance
This switch will not allow the crusher to be restarted until the pressure is back to normal. The fact that a crusher has this flow switch in the oil circuit should not become an excuse for the operator not monitoring the line pressure. A switch can fail. Also conditions may be present where the pressure is slowly dropping because of a slow leak.

## Analysis of the Causes of Water Ingress in the Oil Tank of Cone Crusher 
During the operation of the cone crusher, the oil pressure of the thin oil smooth system is generally 0.05～0.15MPa, while the corresponding cooler water pressure of the thin oil smooth system is generally 0.025～ 0.08 MPa. When the lubricating system shows some problems, it may cause the oil pressure to be low.
