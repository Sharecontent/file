Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities.

## Fracking vs. Lithium Mining: What's the Difference? - Green Matters
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique designed to pull gas and oil from subterranean rock (most of the time, shale rock). The process is named for what happens when the rock is fractured apart. This is facilitated by a high-pressure mixture of water, sand, and chemicals that is injected as the hydraulic drill presses down.
