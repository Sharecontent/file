## Why is Australia still opening coal mines? | The Lighthouse
Old energy: Australia is opening coal mines, while countries such as Germany are closing them down. And yet, while the rest of the world is looking at transitioning away from fossil-fuels such as coal to renewables (Germany is in the process of closing down all its 84 coal-fired power plants), Australia is still opening new mines.
