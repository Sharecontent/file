## Top Challenges Impacting Growth of the Iron Ore Market - SpendEdge
China has faced a significant blow due to such laws as it is the biggest importer of iron ore. Huge Capital Requirements. Iron ore mining requires substantial capital investments due to energy-intensive nature of the extraction process. For instance, the average cost of an iron ore project was around US$236/tonne of capacity in 2014.

Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO
