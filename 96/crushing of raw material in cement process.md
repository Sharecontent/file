## Cement Raw Meal & Homogenization Process in The Cement Industry
Raw meal homogenization is the most important process link of the four, accounting for 40% of the homogenization task. It is an important factor to support the balanced and stable working performance of preheaters and kilns, and plays an important role in improving the output and quality of cement clinker.

## What is the crushing process? - MEKA
Crushing is the process of size reduction of ore. Size reduction process begins with usage of explosives at the area for production of ore. In later stages, the size reduction process performed with crushers before grinding in mills is called "crushing". Although there is no limit set, the downsizing process over 3 mm is considered as "crushing
