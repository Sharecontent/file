Shaft rotary kiln The theoretical heat (the standard enthalpy) of reaction required to make high-calcium lime is around 3.15 MJ per kg of lime, so the batch kilns were only around 20% efficient. The key to development in efficiency was the invention of continuous kilns, avoiding the wasteful heat-up and cool-down cycles of the batch kilns.

1. Working principle. Rotary kiln is the main equipment of cement production. The raw meal powder is fed into the kiln barrel from the bottom of the high end of the kiln tail barrel. Due to the inclination and slow rotation of the kiln barrel, the material rolls in the circumferential direction and moves from high temperature to the axial

How does a Lime Kiln Work. A lime kiln is used for calcination of limestone (calcium carbonate) to produce quicklime also called burnt lime. And the chemical formula is CaCO₃+ heat = CaO +CO₂. Usually, the heat is around 900℃, but a temperature around 1000℃ makes the calcination process more quickly. Of course, the temperature can not

## Lime Kiln - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The conventional rotary lime kiln has a length-to-diameter ( L / D) ratio in the 30-40 range with lengths of 75-500 ft (22.7-152.5 m) and diameter of 4-11 ft (1.2-3.3 m). Lime kilns are usually inclined at about 3°-5° slope with material charged at the elevated end and discharging at the lower end.

This means that an efficient kiln consuming 3.2 GJ per tonne of clinker will only take in 1216 kg of air per tonne of clinker - i.e. the air/clinker ratio is 1.216. Using this air alone in the cooler would result in a clinker temperature of 399°C, so the extra air needed to obtain a reasonable temperature is surplus to requirements.
