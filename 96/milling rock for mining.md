## What is Milling? Climb vs. Conventional Milling Process - Fine MetalWorking
2 Types of Milling. Depending on the direction of the cutter rotation and direction of work-piece feed, you can classify the milling process as Up (conventional) milling and Down (climb) milling. Up (conventional) milling: Here the direction of your work-piece feed is opposite to the direction of the milling cutter.

Cameco Fuel Cycle - Milling. Uranium ore is simply rock with elevated amounts of uranium in it. Once the rock has been removed by open pit or underground mining it must be milled to separate the uranium from other constituents. The milling process for uranium is similar to that used for other metals such as copper, gold or nickel.

## 25.3 Crushing and milling | Mining of mineral resources | Siyavula
The mining industry is an important industry in South Africa. It involves a number of industries working together. Exploration is followed by excavation, which is followed by crushing and milling to reduce the size of the rocks. This is followed by extraction (removing the valuable minerals from the ore) and finally refining.
