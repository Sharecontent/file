## Magnetism
Magnetism is the class of physical attributes that are mediated by a magnetic field, which refers to the capacity to induce attractive and repulsive phenomena in other entities. Electric currents and the magnetic moments of elementary particles give rise to a magnetic field, which acts on other currents and magnetic moments. Magnetism is one aspect of the combined phenomena of electromagnetism.

In actual production, the operation of the magnetic separator has a very obvious impact on the separation index of iron ore. The main operating factors are the thickness of the feed layer of the magnetic separator, the rotational speed of the magnetic separator cylinder, the feeding speed, and the water inlet control. 1.

The effectiveness of jigging operation for the beneficiation of Indian low-grade iron ore was undertaken by Das et al, 2007. While Umadevi et al, 2013, established beneficiation for slimy iron ore by combination techniques of

## Extraction of Nickel from Garnierite Laterite Ore Using Roasting and 
In this study, segregation roasting and magnetic separation are used to extract nickel from a garnierite laterite ore. The garnierite laterite ore containing 0.72% Ni, 0.029% Co, 8.65% Fe, 29.66% MgO, and 37.86% SiO2 was collected in the Mojiang area of China. Garnierite was the Ni-bearing mineral; the other main minerals were potash feldspar, forsterite, tremolite, halloysite, quartz, and
