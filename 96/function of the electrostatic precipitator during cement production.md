## Electric Precipitator - Dust Collector System
Electric Precipitator Description: Electrostatic dust removal is one of the methods of gas dedusting. The dust-containing gas is electrically separated when passing through a high-voltage electrostatic field, and after the negative combination of the dust particles and the negative ions, the surface of anode is discharged and deposited.

The electrostatic precipitator functions by charging particulates within a gas stream as the gas flows through the ESP. These negatively charged particulates are attracted to positively charge large flat plates within the ESP, where they gradually accumulate upon the surfaces of the plates. Once a significant number of particulates have accumulated on the plates, a mechanical mechanism

## Electrostatic Precipitator Working Principle | What Is Electrostatic 
An electrostatic precipitator does not directly contribute to the production of electricity in thermal power plants, but it helps to keep the atmosphere cleans, which is quite important for living beings. Hoppers are fitted under the electrostatic precipitator chamber to collect dust particles.
