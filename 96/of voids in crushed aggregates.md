## The Complete Guide to Crushed Stone and Gravel - gra-rock
If it is crushed, gravel loses its unique smooth rounded texture and becomes crushed stone. It is important to note that some contractors refer to any stone in certain size ranges as "gravel," even if it is crushed stone. For example, depending on the region of the United States, crushed stone in the size of a few mm to 2 inches is referred

The reduction in strength with an increase in PI and in each DR was only obvious for crushed gravel samples and crushed limestone samples with larger voids (i.e., C-CA 2). The reductions in soaked CBR at OMC for crushed gravel (except Sample G) and C-CA 2 samples were up to 35% and 16%, respectively, when PI was increased from 5% to 13%.

Variation in the size of Aggregates changes the water demand, cement content, micro-cracking (strength) in concrete. It also effects pumpability, and durability of concrete. When the particles are of uniform size the spacing is the greatest, but when a range of sizes is used the void spaces are filled and the paste requirement is lowered.

Of more importance for filtration is the grain size of adjacent materials, to minimize migration into your filter material.
