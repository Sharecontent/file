In rod mill-ball mill grinding circuits, where the rod-mill discharge contains 25% or more of the grinding circuit product-size material, the rod-mill discharge can be fed to the ball- or pebble-mill classifier as shown in Fig. 34. This is the most frequently used rod mill-ball mill circuit in the nonferrous ore concentrators.

Rod mills are used in an open circuit between crushing and the ball mill. They often operate in wet and where the pulp contains up to 50% solid by mass. This machine is equally very applicable to dry where it could take a feed that has achieved 6% moisture. As such, when the product is sticky, rod mills are preferred over ball mills.

## Mill (grinding)
Rod mills are less common than ball mills for grinding minerals. The rods used in the mill, usually a high-carbon steel, can vary in both the length and the diameter. However, the smaller the rods, the larger is the total surface area and hence, the greater the grinding efficiency.

The ratio of the length to the diameter of the barrel of the ball mill is relatively small, usually equal to 1 or slightly greater than 1. In addition, the rotating speed of the rod mill barrel is generally lower than that of the ball mill of the same specification, so the grinding medium in the rod mill barrel is usually in a cascading state.
