## Significance of "-Mill Tolerance" in the Piping Stress Analysis
04/09/2008 7:51 AM. Pipe Mill Tolerance in accordance with ASTM, ASME B36.10M is considered to be ±12.5% of the nominal pipe wall thickness, tn. That is to say: if you have a pipe supplied with a nominal thickness tn, and you need to measure the actual thickness, you can find that there is a deviation reaches about ±12.5% tn.

The Stainless Steel Pipe Weight Formula helps in calculating the weight of the pipe. The formula for this pipe is P= t (D-t) X C. Here t is the thickness of the pipe that is expressed in mm or inches. The value D is the external diameter that is measured in inches. C is a static value of 0.02466 that is specified by SI units.

The rope is .25" diameter natural cord. I know it will vary so I'm really just asking for an estimate. Step 1) calculate the surface area of the pipe (cylinder minus the top and bottom circles if you're not covering those) Step 2) If A is the area you need to cover, solve the equation L  .25 = A, (for L). You then need L inches of rope.

## GSHP: How much space is needed for a GSHP installation?

The amount of space needed can be significantly decreased by looping the piping and placing it at the bottom of the trench (in a "slinky configuration"), though more piping will be required.
