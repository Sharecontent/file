For example, the carbonation resistance of concrete with a cement with only 15 mass % limestone was equal to that of a cement with 30 or even 50 mass % limestone when the w/c ratio was reduced from 0.5 to 0.35 or 0.3 (Figure 3). Of course, sophisticated process measures in cement plants are necessary for the production of high-limestone cements.

Slag cement is the byproduct of steel production. It is formed by the molten slag in blast furnaces used to process iron ore to make steel. Finely ground limestone can replace 5% to 15% of portland cement. Portland-limestone cements require less energy to produce because the limestone is not pyroprocessed like the portland cement it replaces.

Mar 26, 2015 {Answer} Recently, ASTM C150 was harmonized to meet the AASHTO M85 to allow up to 5% limestone in the cement. The history of limestone in cement is a little checkered, and as a result, there is some controversy in this decision, along with some confusion and concern. Here in the U.S. it is long past when finely ground limestone was added to cement to make "adulterated" cement
