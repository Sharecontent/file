## Quarry Mining, Open-Pit Mining, Strip Mining, Mining Techniques 
Quarries are normally shallower than other kinds of open-pit mines. Quarries are also at times used as filming locations. In other words a quarry is a big man-made hole in the ground from where minerals or rock are taken out. Quarries are made when big deposits of commercially helpful minerals or rock are found close to the Earth's surface.

Quarrying it should have been unimaginably difficult with the existence of nothing more than hand-held stone tools. For many centuries, limestone and sandstone were the predominant materials used by the ancient Egyptians. As their quarrying techniques improved, they turned to harder stones like granite and quickly learned how to quarry it.

Limestone's volume changes because, as it is quarried, the stone decompresses. Seasoned stone blocks are cut and fabricated to size. Because of its natural uniformity of composition, texture, and structure, Indiana limestone can be shaped and textured by machine-planing or hand-chiseling in any direction. Limestone can be finished with sandpaper.
