## Manufacturing process of concrete Research Paper - Studentshare
Extract of sample "Manufacturing process of concrete". Earlier clay was also used as bonding material to prepare the concrete by the Assyrians and Babylonian. The Egyptians introduced the use of lime and gypsum cement to make concrete. In 1756, the first modern concrete was invented by the British engineer John Smeaton.

## How concrete is made - material, manufacture, making, how to make, used 
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First, the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared. Next, the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel), admixtures (chemical additives), any necessary fibers, and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete. The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed

Advantages of precast concrete: Precast concrete has several advantages over cast-in-situ concrete: 1. When identical members are cast, it is advantageous for the same formwork to be used. 2. As better quality control can be exercised in the factory or yard site, concrete of superior quality can be produced. 3.

## What Are the Properties of Aggregates for Concrete?
Aggregates are used in concrete to provide economy in the cost of concrete. Aggregates act as filler only. These do not react with cement and water. But there are properties or characteristics of aggregate which influence the properties of resulting concrete mix. These are as follow. Composition. Size & Shape.
