## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
Why is limestone scattered around a coal mine? Limestone powder, known as rock dust, is spread throughout the mine workings on a regular basis. .. When explosions do occur, the dispersed limestone powder absorbs the heat generated from the explosion and will either stop the chain reaction or reduce the intensity of the explosion.

Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are prevented by generous application of rock dust (usually limestone). If an explosion should occur, the rock dust disperses, mixes with the coal dust and prevents flame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink. To investigate this process in more detail, a number of explosion

## crushed limestone additives in coal plants
When crushed and processed, limestone can be made into a white powder. Limestone can be made to absorb sulfur gases under the right conditions. In most scrubbers, limestone (or another similar material called lime) is mixed with water and sprayed into the coal combustion gases. The limestone captures the sulfur and "pulls" it out of the gases.
