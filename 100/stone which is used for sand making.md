## Do You Need To Use Sand Underneath Pavers? - Greatmats
If a thick layer of sand shifts underneath the pavers after the installation, some of the individual stones could slide out of place, creating huge gaps in the stone tile pattern, resulting in an unsafe and unstable layout. Loose sand also could move out of place slowly over many weeks and months when rain and wind catch the sand, creating dust

## Sandstone |Composition, Properties, Formation, Uses »Geology Science
Sandstone Formation. Formation of the sandstones are cemented grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic crystals. The cements binding these grains together are typically calcite, clays, and silica. Grain sizes in sands are defined (in geology) within the range of 0.0625 mm to 2 mm (0.0025-0.08 inches).

Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Sandstones comprise about 20-25% of all sedimentary rocks.. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface.
