## Energy Audit of Coal Handling Power Plant - IJERT
Thus, by using this method of energy audit of coal handling plant we can find out the actual losses, method to rectify them and actual cost of the coal lost. In form of dust = 5 Kg = 5x 3.21. = 16.05 /-. Theft loss in wagon = Amount of coal feed in wagon = 100 ton. Amount of coal lest at last when it reaches the power plant = 70 ton.

Coal Particle Size For Power Plant. This work has analyzed the influence of the particle size of a calcite from a quarry, whether original, calcined, or rehydrated, on the efficiency of CO capture of the gases emitted in a coal-fired power plant. Three different particle sizes 0.5 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.045 mm have been studied.

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.
