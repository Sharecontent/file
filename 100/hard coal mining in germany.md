## Lessons from six decades of hard coal production phase-out in Germany
Taking the Paris Agreement seriously, implies a coal phase-out for all industrialized countries by 2030. In our paper in Climate Policy we derive lessons for these upcoming coal phase-outs from examining the phase-out of hard coal production in the two largest mining regions of Germany, the Ruhr area and the Saarland. The analysis starts with the first coal crisis in Germany in the year 1957

## The era of hard coal mining ended in Germany in 2018 
But even in the old coal mines in the Ruhr area, there is still much work to do after 2018. With the end of active coal mining these mines cannot be left to their own devices. For example, machinery and equipment must be taken out of a depth of at least 1,000 meters and pipelines and cables must be dismantled, old cavities and shafts secured

## Hard coal and lignite
Internationally, hard coal is mined both in underground and open-cast mines. In Europe, coal is mined almost exclusively underground and that was the case in Germany until the end of 2018. Coal was mined underground in Germany down to a depth of up to 1400 m, exclusively using the "longwall mining" tech- nique.

More recently, reductions in coal consumption in Germany have stalled and coal-related emissions have even temporarily increased. However, to comply with the 2°C target, Germany would need to phase out both hard coal and lignite consumption in the energy sector well before 2050, with various studies suggesting a shut-down of large shares of

Germany is considering its timetable for coal phaseout. Hard coal mining in Germany is centered in Ibbenbüren, the Ruhr and the Saar coalfields. In 200 the U.S. Geological Survey reports that approximately 25.6 million tonnes of anthracticte and bituminous coal was mined and a further 177 million tonnes of lignite.

With the closure of the last German hard-coal mine Prosper-Haniel, on December 21st 2018, a 200-years lasting part of German industrial history came to an end. For many decades, hard-coal mining with its high extraction volumes from deep mines, posed special challenges to hoisting technology, particularly to vertical hoisting.

Hard coal has been mined in the present EEC countries for several hundred years. In the middle of the 18th century there were already a great number of collieries in the Ruhr. They were, however, small, the largest of them employing 22 men. They did not work far below the surface and their output was small [1, p 8], for example, a total of about 30,000 tons in the Ruhr in 1739 [2, p 108]. The
