On the other hand, because of deforestation and fires, the Amazon is a source of 500 million to 700 million tons of carbon a year. So if the deforestation continues, all that area is not acting as a carbon sink anymore. So in the next 20 to 30 years, the Amazon will become only a source of carbon.

## What Are the Pollution Issues in the Amazon Rainforest?
Water pollution is worsening in the Amazon as a result of extensive logging in the rainforest. Areas that were once thick with trees have been converted into open plains, resulting in forest flooding. Gold mining is leading to mercury pollution and dams that are being built in the river basin may alter the flow of water in the river.
