## Method for producing copper oxide - Hickson Corporation
Abstract: A method for producing copper oxide. In the method, a copper bearing material, aqueous ammonia, and a sufficient amount of an ammonium salt to double the rate of production of copper oxide in the absence of the salt are placed in a single vessel. The vessel is closed, and oxygen is fed into the vessel.

Application of the monometallic copper leads to the formation of cyclohexanone as the main product, but with low activity.

## what are the byproducts of producing the copper through mining
Processes: copper mining and production. Copper is found in natural ore deposits around the world. This page explains copper mining: the production route taken from ore-containing rock to a final product that is the highest-purity commercial metal in existence and used in a wide variety of applications essential to modern living.
