## Why do cone crushers need full cavity feeding?-Jiaozuo zhongxin heavy 
The crushing cavity of the cone crusher is the space formed between two moving parts, that is, the space between the fixed cone lining plate and the moving cone lining plate. That is to say, the upper part of the crushing cavity is the feeding space, and the lower part is the discharging space. Therefore, when the cone crusher is full of materials, the crushing cavity can only be filled with
