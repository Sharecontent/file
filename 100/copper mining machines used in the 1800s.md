The equipment used for surface alluvial mining was cheap, portable and easy to use. The pan and gold washing cradle were imported from California and used gravity to separate the gold (gold is heavier than water and the surrounding rock and soil). Together with the pick and shovel, this equipment provided adequate access to alluvial deposits.

5 Pans. Panning for gold was also known as "placer mining." Early miners sat by riverbeds, scooping wet soil into shallow metal pans. They swirled the pans, washing away the dirt to hopefully discover particles of gold. Though more complex equipment was eventually invented, pans were still a useful tool to distinguish gold from dirt.
