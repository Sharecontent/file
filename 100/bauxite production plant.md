## Essay on Bauxite: Formation, Uses and Production - Your Article Library
Bauxite is an impure raw material. At least 6 tons of bauxite is required to produce 1 ton of aluminium. So it is advisable to set up alumina production plants near the bauxite mines. At present bauxite, rather aluminium, enjoys an enviable position, as it has outpaced several traditional metals like copper, tin etc.

## Aluminium production process
ALUMINA PRODUCTION. Bauxite is crushed, dried and ground in special mills where it is mixed with a small amount of water. This process produces a thick paste that is collected in special containers and heated with steam to remove most of the silicon present in bauxites. The ore is loaded into autoclaves and treated with lime-caustic soda.

## calcined bauxite plant
Bauxite tailings, also known as red mud, red sludge, bauxite residue, or alumina refinery residues ARR, is a highly alkaline waste product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of alumina aluminium oxide, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of aluminium metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics, abrasives and refractories

## TENORM: Bauxite and Alumina Production Wastes | US EPA
Oct 6, 2021Bauxite is used to produce alumina, which is then used to produce aluminum. Wastes can be generated at several points in the production process, including during the mining of the bauxite ore, and during the refinery production process. The refinery processes used to produce aluminum generates about 2 - 2.5 tons of solid waste for every 1 ton
