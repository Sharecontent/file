## Milling Machine: Definition, Parts, Types, Operations (With PDF)
CNC milling machine: CNC is the most versatile milling machine which is control by a computer. It is an upgraded version of the bed type mill machine, in which the spindle can move in all three directions and the table can rotate 360 degrees. These all movement is hydraulically controlled which is commanded by a computer.
