Barite is a mineral composed of barium sulfate (BaSO 4 ). It receives its name from the Greek word "barys" which means "heavy." This name is in response to barite's high specific gravity of 4.5, which is exceptional for a nonmetallic mineral. The high specific gravity of barite makes it suitable for a wide range of industrial, medical, and

The specific gravity (also called relative density) is the measure that's used to compare the two densities. Mathematically it's expressed as: specific gravity = s.g. = density test liquid / density reference liquid. If the density of the test liquid is larger than that of the reference (e.g. a sugar solution), the specific gravity is > 1,0.

It can be said excavating companies consume more barite powder when the specific gravity of excavation mud is diminished because barite powder can enhance specific gravity but the viscosity goes up.

## Barite Mineral Physical - Optical Properties, Uses and Occurrence
The barium sulfate barite takes its name from the Greek word barys, which means "heavy" a reference to its high specific gravity. It has also been called heavy spar. Barite crystals are sometimes tinged yellow, blue, or brown. Golden barite comes from South Dakota. Crystals are well formed, usually either prismatic or tabular.
