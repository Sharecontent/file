## Stripping ratio - Negapedia
It is a number or ratio that express how much waste is mined per unit of ore. The units of a stripping ratio can vary between mine types. For example, in coal mining the stripping ratio is commonly referred to as volume/weight. Whereas in metal mining, stripping ratio is unitless and is expressed as weight/weight.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity.  When the operation reaches a predetermined stripping ratio (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue. Depending on the equipment available, it may

## stripping ratio in coal mining
The stripping ratio method of calculating the profitability of the mining procedure is commonly used in the ore or coal mining process. In relation to its application in the mining of ore, the utility of the stripping ratio is the determination of the approximate ratio of waste material that must be moved in order to reach a certain ratio of ore.
