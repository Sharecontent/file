99% of global cobalt production is mined as a by-product of copper or nickel. Global cobalt revenues represents ~ 6.7% of nickel miners total revenue and ~1.3% of copper miners total revenue. In 2018, cobalt supply from the DRC increased by 14.7% to reach 80,790 tonnes, representing 67% of global mined output (Darton, February 2018).

The production of copper, as in the utilization of any other natural resource, has an impact on the environment. This cannot be avoided since the earth must be disturbed in order to extract copper from it; however, the object of the copper mining industry has been to make this impact as small as possible.

The Katanga copper-cobalt ore belt of the Congo has huge reserves of copper and cobalt resources. Continuous optimization of cobalt mining and processing methods can improve resource utilization, reduce investment and production costs, ensure global cobalt supply, which is a scarce and vital strategic mineral resource.

##  Cobalt: demand-supply balances in the transition to electric  - Europa
the long lead-time for developing new mining projects, and the fact that cobalt is mainly mined and recovered as a co- or by-product of copper and nickel. In 2016, 126 000 tonnes of cobalt were mined in 20 countries around the world, with the largest supply coming from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (55 % of global cobalt production).

Cobalt helps us to power mobile phones, laptops, and electric cars. But while the metal is high in demand for green technology, getting it is the hard part.  Cobalt can also be found up north, as the NWT becomes a more interesting mineral destination for companies. 160km from Yellowknife is a gold-cobalt-bismuth-copper deposit being developed. Cobalt is a silvery gray metal that has diverse
