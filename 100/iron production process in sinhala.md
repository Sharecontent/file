The process is completely CO2 free, the only emissions from the process is water and pure iron pellets. The production process is centered around a 5-ton Bell furnace with electric heating units. The furnace is charged with oxidized iron-based pellets and evacuated. Thereafter the furnace is heated to ca 650°C and pressurized hydrogen is added.

##  WORLD DIRECT REDUCTION STATISTICS - Midrex
Production of DRI in Iran was a record 30.2 Mt, all from natural gas-based processes. This is a 5.9% increase over 2019. The MIDREX Process accounts for ~ 90% of DRI production in Iran. Several MIDREX Modules that either started production or ramped up during 2020 were responsible for the bulk of the growth.

## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

Vacuum treatment (generally called vacuum degassing) is a commonly used steelmaking process, used for removing dissolved gases (e.g. hydrogen) from the steel. In this process, the steel is exposed to a vacuum which promotes transfer of dissolved gases from the liquid steel to gas phase.
