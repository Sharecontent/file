The constituents used for the binder are cement and water, while the filler can be fine or coarse aggregate. The role of these constituents will be discussed in this section. Cement, as it is commonly known, is a mixture of compounds made by burning limestone and clay together at very high temperatures ranging from 1400 to 1600 [[ring]]C.

Cement may also use carbon capture storage technologies to eventually abate any carbon produced from cement feedstock such as limestone. However, this approach can only be used in cement sites located near CCS facilities. More use of extenders, particularly natural pozzolans (pumice) to replace fly-ash or clinker would be possible in many regions.

It plays a crucial role in the economy due to its sophisticated supply chain. The cement industry created more than 8% of jobs globally and around 5.5% of global GDP.  Bangladesh has a shortage of essential mineral resources like limestone, the primary material for cement production. So, almost all manufacturers must import raw materials

Portland cement, the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-speciality grout, was developed in England in the mid 19th century, and usually originates from limestone.

This renders limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) a viable alternative for the future of green cement. One of the main differences between LC3 and OPC is rheological behavior, which greatly influences practical application. Rheology plays a key role in the application of cementitious materials and in achieving successful concrete performance.

Most limestone is made into crushed stone that is used in road base, railroad ballast, foundation stone, drainfields, concrete aggregate, and other construction uses. It is fired in a kiln with crushed shale to make cement. Some varieties of limestone perform well in these uses because they are strong, dense rocks with few pore spaces.
