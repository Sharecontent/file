## Grinding Machining Process : Complete Notes - mech4study
The grinding machine provides high accuracy and fine surface finish with minimum tolerances. The machining process is done by the abrasive action of the grinding wheel; the abrasives are embedded over the periphery of the rotating wheel. In Grinding machine grinding wheel is work as a cutting tool and responsible for all machining processes.
