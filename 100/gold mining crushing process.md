In addition, the live monitoring of the final product particle size leads to a maximum grinding circuit throughput. This is essential for driving the overall efficiency of the operation because the process of grinding and crushing ore — known as comminution — is on average the highest energy step in mining.

Removing the gold-bearing rock from the ground is just the first step. To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
