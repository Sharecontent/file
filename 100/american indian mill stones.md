## Ancient Weapons - The Indians' Use of the Tomahawk
The war club was used as the primary weapon by the Iroquois during the French and Indian war. The tomahawk has become a popular weapon or perhaps a fad amongst the survival community. Not anywhere near as effective as a sidearm, the tomahawk nevertheless has an ancient and noble history as a melee weapon and was used by the American Indians.

These stone fetishes represent the spirits of animals or the forces of nature and are most often used in an effort to master the arbitrary and unpredictable forces beyond their control. Fetishes may be of any form or material.
