## Info Sandstone - How is it Formed? - Artistic Tile
Origins of Sandstone. Sandstones are clastic in origin (as opposed to organic, like chalk and coal, or chemical, like gypsum and jasper). They are formed from cemented grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic crystals. The cements binding these grains together are typically calcite, clays and silica.

Silicon (Si) is a semi-metallic or metalloid, because it has several of the metallic characteristics. Silicon is never found in its natural state, but rather in combination with oxygen as the silicate ion SiO 44- in silica-rich rocks such as obsidian, granite, diorite, and sandstone. Feldspar and quartz are the most significant silicate minerals.

## Where Is Quartz Sandstone Found - Realonomics
Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand but it can also contain significant amounts of feldspar and sometimes silt and clay. Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz is called quartzose sandstone. Where does sandstone come from? Sandstone forms from beds of sand laid down under the sea or in low-lying areas on the continents.

## How Does Marble Get Mined From a Quarry? - RIOSTONES
Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall.". The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.
