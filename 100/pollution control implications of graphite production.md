## Effects of Environmental Pollution - BYJUS
Pollution occurs mainly when human activities disrupt natural elemental cycles or reservoirs. The main sources of anthropogenic pollution can be broadly categorised as energy production, industry, agriculture, transportation and waste management. Pollution can be explained using the source pathway receptor concept known as the pollutant linkage.

Intercalation. Due to its extreme anisotropy, the graphite crystal enables salts to be intercalation in its structure. When heated, these salts evaporate, causing the disruption of inter-planar connections, "expanding" the graphite. Nacional de Grafite developed graphite intercalation and expansion processes compatible with the environment.

Pollution from vehicles: Carbon monoxide gas is generally emitted by cars and trucks and when we inhaled CO, it blocks oxygen from reaching out to our main vital organs such as brain and heart. Also, excess emission leads to environmental pollution. Transportation is the main cause in this area as a huge amount of goods are traveling around the

The contribution of nuclear power is at present about 3% and it should be increased slowly by taking all precautions. (9) The garbage in big cities should be treated with cobalt rays. This can reduce the pollution load to about 60% in cities. (10) Incorporation of improved process design will increase the longevity of equipment.

In this process, agglomerated graphite grains are produced for use as carburizer and carbon additives. Intercalation. Due to its extreme anisotropy, the graphite crystal enables salts to be intercalation in its structure. When heated, these salts evaporate, causing the disruption of inter-planar connections, "expanding" the graphite.

Jul 26, 2021Around 75,000 tonnes of graphite is required to create 1 million EVs, meaning that to produce 12 million EVs will need 900,000 tonnes of graphite by 2025. Producing anode grade graphite for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is energy-intensive. In many countries where they depend on coal for electricity, it means they use more coal to do this process.

Pollution control. Pollution control is the process of reducing or eliminating the release of pollutants into the environment.It is regulated by various environmental agencies which establish pollutant discharge limits for air, water, and land.. Air pollution control strategies can be divided into two categories, the control of particulate emissions and the control of gaseous emissions.

## Lower graphite production in China could mean higher battery prices - Axios
China has steadily been forcing producers of graphite — a material commonly used in smartphone and laptop batteries — to close in response to rising pollution, as mining companies fail to improve the conditions of local land and water resources.. Why it matters: Batteries account for roughly 30% of the global demand for graphite, and China produces 70% of the world's graphite supply.
