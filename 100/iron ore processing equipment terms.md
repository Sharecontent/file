## Iron ore crushing and screening process
Aug 3, 20222. Iron ore screening process: Iron ore screening equipment generally uses a circular vibrating screen to screen the materials after the second crushing. Generally, materials with a size of 10mm or less can be screened for dry selection. After screening, materials with a size of 10-40mm enter the fine crusher for fine crushing.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
