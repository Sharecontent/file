## Environmental impacts of coal - Global Energy Monitor
Coal sludge, also known as slurry, is the liquid coal waste generated by washing coal. It is typically disposed of at impoundments located near coal mines, but in some cases it is directly injected into abandoned underground mines.  As of June 2010, no national limits exist on air pollution from coal mines. On June 17, 2010, in a petition

The royalty rate per ton of coal extracted from Deer Run Mine should be increased. It is hard to understand why Illinois is one of the few coal mining states that do not have a severance tax. West Virginia has a 6.5% and Wyoming a 10.6% coal severance tax. Some Illinois communities have shown their support for a coal severance tax.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Coal Industry?
The coal industry has a significantly negative environmental impact on the land, water, and air. It is responsible for producing pollution such as ash, sludge, slurry, arsenic, mercury, uranium, and other heavy metals that pollute the air and waterways. Additionally, coal processing has a negative effect on human health.

Unique value of coal slime ball. 1.The coal slime balls can burn more fully in the furnace than coal slurries directly burning. 2.Coal slime ball breaks the limits of small fuel supply selectivity at pit-mouth power plant. It can increase the amount of slime usage and the share of fine coal particles in the furnace.

Coal slurry is first prepared by crushing the coal to a size of 0.2 mm particle diameter along with water addition. The coal slurry is the pumped to the gasifier where the reactions take place in the controlled amount of oxygen. The gasifier effluent contains a mixture of gaseous products including CO, H 2, CO 2, H 2 O, Ar, H 2 S and minor quantities of other gases.

## Environmental Contaminants in Coal Slurry Intended for Underground 
The aqueous suspension of fine refuse, referred to as coal slurry, frequently contains potentially toxic substances, including hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and coal cleaning chemicals. Disposal of coal slurry using underground injection has raised environmental concerns because it may lead to contamination of groundwater and water supplies.

What is Coal Slurry. Coal slurry or sludge is a waste fluid produced by washing coal with water and chemicals prior to shipping the coal to market. When coal is mined underground or by high walls or auger miners, there are significant amounts of rocks and clays mixed in. These materials must be removed before the coal can be sold to power

## Coal Slurry: an Idea that Came and Went | WyoHistory
Most coal is hauled by coal unit trains—100 rail cars with 100 tons of coal in each. During the coal boom of the 1970s, slurry pipelines were proposed as an alternative to rail transport. Coal would be crushed, then mixed with water to create a slurry and sent via pipeline to its destination, where the mixture was dried, then burned.

During the coal mining process, underground water is generated from the longwall face. In the meantime, the coal cutting process would produce coal particles. Coal slurry is generated in the underground working site, especially for water abundant coal mines. The generated coal slurry is treated to prevent water pollution. Due to the extensively existing of the suspended solid, the traditional
