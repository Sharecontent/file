If the ratio between gold and silver reaches at least 20% silver, the material is called "electrum."  (as shown in the diagram on the left). If the silver price is $25 per troy ounce and the lead price is $1 per avoirdupois pound, the value of the lead in one ton of ore will be $1720, while the value of the silver in that same ton of ore

## Electrolytic processes for gold and other precious metals
Electro-refining is the preferred method as an electrolytic process for gold and other precious metals. The electro-refining process uses a melted solid mixture of impure metal as the anode and a thin sheet of metal as the cathode. When the electrodes are immersed in an electrolyte and an electrical current is applied, pure metal is deposited

## mining flow diagram silver
Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver mineral within the ore mineral.

## The metallurgic treatment of an ore for gold, silver, lead, and copper
The lead from which the silver and gold is to be extracted is put in the larger pot, where the necessary zinc is added, usually in three successive additions. The manner of adding the zinc is as follows - A perforated iron vessel is so arranged over the pot that it can be raised from and lowered into the molten lead at pleasure.
