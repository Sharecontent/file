## Furnace cement powdern-rauch
Cement is a commonly used binding material in the construction. The cement is obtained by burning a mixture of calcarious (calcium) and argillaceous (clay) material at a very high temperature and then grinding the clinker so produced to a fine powder.It was first produced by a mason Joseph Aspdin in England in 1924. Bulk storage silos made of steel are the perfect solution to store the
