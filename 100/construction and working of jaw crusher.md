Jaw crushers are the most common solution in underground applications when the throughput is below 1000 tonnes per hour, depending somewhat on the scalping solutions. Above 1000 tph, primary gyratory crushers are an option. After the throughput reaches 2000 tph, jaw crushers are very rare, with the exception of a parallel plant layout.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
