## Low grade Iron Ore Beneficiation and the Process of Jigging
The reasons for choosing jigging for the iron ore beneficiation over other processes include (i) relatively easy separation, (ii) beneficial trade-off between operating cost and reduced yield relative to dense medium processes, (iii) ability to treat ores requiring cut densities higher than a density of 4.0, and (iv) physical characteristics of

## Tin ore separation process - Jinpeng Mining
Tin ore separation process The density of tin ore is bigger than paragenetic mineral, so we use gravity concentration to processing tin ore . Because there are many oxide iron ore inside, for example : magnetite, hematite, if use gravity concentration or flotation, that could not separate them from tin, so magnetic will be added .
