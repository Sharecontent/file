South African coal for local electricity production is among the cheapest in the world. The beneficiation of coal, particularly for export, results in more than 65Mt of coal discards being produced every year. About 21 percent of the run-of-mine coal produced is exported, and 21 percent is used locally (excluding power-station coal).

Increasingly mines are simply abandoned, leaving a legacy of local and global pollution. Every year, South Africa's coal mines - operational and abandoned - are estimated to release greenhouse pollution equivalent to 900,000 cars. Proper rehabilitation of mines includes backfilling and sealing old shafts, halting the release of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases.
