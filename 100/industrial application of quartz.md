The first report of the hydrothermal growth of crystals was by German geologist Karl Emil von Schafhäutl () in 1845: he grew microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker. In 1848, Robert Bunsen reported growing crystals of barium and strontium carbonate at 200 °C and at pressures of 15 atmospheres, using sealed glass tubes and aqueous ammonium chloride ("Salmiak") as a solvent.

## industrial application of quartz
The industrial application of ultra-pure Quartz is used in contemporary high-tech applications such as electronic industry, optical fibres, silicon cells for photovoltaic systems and semiconductors. Silicon metal is produced from lumpy silica (Quartz) (SiO2) that is carbo-thermically reduced in arc-furnaces at high temperatures.

Education. A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit which is used for the mechanical resonance of a vibrating crystal of piezoelectric material. It will create an electrical signal with a given frequency. This frequency is commonly used to keep track of time. elprocus. Follow.

## Uses of Piezoelectric Crystals In Daily Life - Beijing Ultrasonic
Quartz Clocks. One typical application of piezoelectricity property is in quartz clocks and timers. Different size of quartz crystals will vibrate at different rates, and detectable electrical pulses can be produced when the crystals vibrate back and forth. A quartz clock can keep time through a small precisely cut crystal.
