Bauxite is mined by surface methods (open-cut mining) in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers. The topsoil is then stored and later used for revegetating and restoring the area after mining is completed. The underlying bauxite is mined by front-end loaders, power shovels or hydraulic excavators.

Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which

Surface mining. Surface mining is best suited to extract minerals that are close to the surface of the earth. It is also usually a more cost-effective mining method compared to underground mining. Common minerals extracted using surface mining are some of the most mined including coal, iron and bauxite. Underground mining (or subsurface mining)
