## Belt conveyor calculation online
Tension Control in Conveyors Belt tension is a critical component in conveyor design. It limits the amount of load that a conveyor can carry and is important in transferring the power from the driving force into the belt via friction. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg [2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hgmm

A belt conveyor is a medium or an endless loop, which carries baggage, products-in-progress, or packed items, depending upon the application, to their destination. However, carrying stuff is just one of the application areas in multiple industries. It is used in lever and pulley mechanisms in the form of an endless rotational loop to process or churn a given material.
