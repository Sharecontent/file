## Experimental Study on Bentonite Clay Powder with Silica Fume and GGBS 
Workability of concrete was found to be decreased with the increase in bentonite clay powder. It further decreased as the silica fume (10%) added to the concrete. But there was no effect in workability as the GGBS (50%) added to the concrete. 5% of cement can be effectively replaced with bentonite clay powder.

In New Mexico, Oklahoma and Wyoming, 25, six and eight wells have been plugged. In one trial in Barrow Island, Western Australia, in 2003, plugging a well with bentonite was estimated to cost A$16,500 (US$13,000), less than half the cost of using cement. It was also quicker, taking on average 39 working hours, compared to cement's 60.

Cement mixers (also known as concrete mixers ) combine materials to form concrete. They aim to produce a homogenous mixture of cement, water, sand/gravel, etc. to form concrete that can be used for various construction projects. Cement mixers typically have a revolving drum that mixes the components in the tank.
