Calcination is generally used for ores containing carbonates and hydrated oxides. Roasting is carried out in a reverberatory furnace This process is usually used for sulphide ores. During this process the moisture is removed, organic matter is destroyed and non-metallic impurities like that of S, P and As are oxidized and removed as volatile gases.
