##  12.3 Primary Copper Smelting - US EPA
(1.6 millon tons) of ore produced in 1991. Copper is produced in the U. S. primarily by pyrometallurgical smelting methods.  A final air blast ("final blow") oxidizes the copper sulfide to SO2, and blister copper forms, containing 98 to 99 percent coppers. The blister copper is removed from the converter for subsequent refining.

Summary An analysis of energy usage in the production of refined cathode copper was made from mining ore to cathode copper. In mining copper ore the greatest energy consumers are ore hauling and blasting. Another important factor is the "recovery efficiency" of the metallurgical processes used to extract the copper.

Flotation: the addition of a compound that attaches to the valuable mineral and floats. Smelting: roasting rock at a temperature greater than 900 o C. This causes it to segregate into layers. The valuable minerals are then extracted. This requires a lot of energy. Extracting metal from rock is so energy-intensive that it's much better to recycle.

It means that a tonne of ore with 0.3g/t can be sent to the mill and be expected to generate a small amount of profit. Ten percent dilution in this mine will reduce the grade of ore from 0.3g/t to 0.28g/t which is below cut-off grade and will not be able to return a profit.
