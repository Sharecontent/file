## Maryland's Chromite Deposits - Where to Find Rocks
The Serpentine Barrens of Central Maryland produced an interesting landscape for a 19th century business monopoly on chromite ore, being the sole resource for world looking for new metal alloys. In addition to the facinating story of this legacy of chromite ore, the mines also produced a line of fine minerals, brucite, antigorite in fine .

## What Is Chromite | Chromite Sand - SICHENG
Chromite is an oxide mineral composed of chromium, iron, and oxygen (FeCr2O4). It is dark gray to black in color with a metallic to submetallic luster and high specific gravity. It occurs in basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks and in the metamorphic and sedimentary rocks that are produced when chromite-bearing rocks are altered by heat or weathering.

Chromite is usually one of the first minerals to crystallize in basaltic magma, and is thus commonly found as a layer near the bottom of magma chambers. In this sample, the black, once-flat chromite layer deformed, probably while the rock was still partially molten. Provided by Stillwater Mining Company, Nye, Montana

The two main categories of igneous rocks are extrusive and intrusive. Extrusive rocks are formed on the surface of the Earth from lava which is magma that has emerged from underground. Intrusive rocks are formed from magma that cools and solidifies within the crust of the planet. How do you know if a rock is extrusive or intrusive?

How is chromite found in nature? Chromite is found as orthocumulate lenses in peridotite from the Earth's mantle. It also occurs in layered, ultramafic intrusive rocks. In addition, it is found in metamorphic rocks such as some serpentinites. Ore deposits of chromite form as early magmatic differentiates.

## Where is chromite found in the philippines?s
Hand specimen identification of chromite requires a consideration of: color, specific gravity, luster, and a characteristic brown streak. The most important clue to identifying chromite is its association with ultrabasic igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks such as serpentinite. Chromite is sometimes slightly magnetic.

Chromite ore is usually a combination of spinels with associated minerals such as calcite, magnetite, talc, serpentines and uvarovite. Chromites crystals exhibit an octahedral structure similar to magnetite. The Cr 3+ ions are in the octahedral position with oxygen. The chromium rich phase is antiferromagnetic.

Chromite (Cr) occurs exclusively in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks (Papp and Lipin, 2006 ). Although some Cr-based minerals such as crocoite (PbCrO 4 ), vauquelinite (Pb 2 Cu [CrO 4 ] [PO 4 ]), uvarovite (Ca 3 Cr 2 [SiO 4] 3 ), and merumite (4 (Cr,Al) 2 O 3 ·3H 2 O) are well known, chromite (FeCr 2 O 4) is the only one that is a commercially recoverable source of Cr ( Sueker, 2006; Glastonbury et al., 2010; Murthy et al., 2011; van der Merwe et al., 2012; Sanchez-Segado et al., 2015 ).

It occurs in basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks and in the metamorphic and sedimentary rocks that are produced when chromite-bearing rocks are altered by heat or weathering. Chromite is important because it is the only economic ore of chromium, an essential element for a wide variety of metal, chemical, and manufactured products. Many other minerals contain chromium, but none of them are found in deposits that can be economically mined to produce chromium.

## Chromite
Chromite is a crystalline mineral composed primarily of iron oxide and chromium oxide compounds. It can be represented by the chemical formula of FeCr2O4. It is an oxide mineral belonging to the spinel group. The element magnesium can substitute for iron in variable amounts as it forms a solid solution with magnesiochromite. A substitution of the element aluminium can also occur, leading to hercynite. Chromite today is mined particularly to make stainless steel through the production of ferrochr

Jul 22, 2022The specific gravity of chromite ore is 4.1~4.7g/cm 3, while that figure of associated gangue and iron silicate minerals is generally 2.7~3.2g/cm 3.  Due to the huge difference in the grain size of chromite rocks, we will use multi gravity separators, i.e. different combinations of jigs, shaking tables, spiral chutes to form a complex chrome
