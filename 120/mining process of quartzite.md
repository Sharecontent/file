## Quartzite
Quartzite is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts.Pure quartzite is usually white to grey, though quartzites often occur in various shades of pink and red due to varying amounts of hematite.

## Quartzite | Minerals Crushing in Mining - JXSX Mine
Quartzite. Quartzite is a metamorphic rock derived from sandstone that is distinguished from sandstone by its fracture. Sandstone breaks along grain boundaries, whereas rock is so well indurated (hardened) that it breaks across constituent grains. Color: Usually white or gray, can be other colors, due to impurities.

## quartzite mining processing
Quartz Mining and Extraction Quartz Mining Processing. The processing of the quartz crystal depends on the amount, origin and the type of impurities present in the ore. After the quartz is successfully mined, it must go through a series of steps to remove its flaws.The process includes crushing, screening, floating and other chemical techniques.
