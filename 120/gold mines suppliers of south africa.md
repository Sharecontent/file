## Mining in SA - Minerals Council South Africa
Economic activity in modern-day South Africa has been centred on mining activities, their ancillary services and supplies. The country's stock exchange in Johannesburg was established in 1887, a decade after the first diamonds were discovered on the banks of the Orange River, and almost simultaneously with the gold rush on the world-famous Witwatersrand.
