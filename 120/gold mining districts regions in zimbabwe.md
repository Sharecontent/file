When coal seams are ripped from the earth, rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals get exposed to air and water, creating toxic cocktails of sulfuric acid and dissolved metals, usually iron. This acid mine drainage (AMD) can excise all life from a stream. And even where the kill is incomplete, iron precipitate can render the streambed unfit.

Abstract. This paper is based on the dataset that I collected during my doctoral research in Eastern Zimbabwe between 2015 and 2018. The dataset represents an investigation of pre-colonial and contemporary gold mining practices in this area and covers the period from AD from an anthropological and archaeological perspective.

Gold panning in Kwekwe is controlled by a cartel of senior cabinet ministers and politicians who buy the gold from the panners. In January 2012 a new gold rush began in Kwekwe following the discovery of gold nuggets by local panners at Sherwood Park.
