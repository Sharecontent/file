Sep 21, 2020The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. The process, which uses mercury amalgamation to recover silver from ore, was reportedly invented by Bartolomé de Medina in Pachuca, Mexico, in 1554. It replaced smelting as the primary method of extracting silver from ore at Spanish colonies in the Americas.

## Patio process
The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. Smelting, or refining, was necessary because silver does not occur by itself in a natural state like some metals. Instead, it is made up of a larger ore body. Thus, smelting, or refining, is necessary to remove other byproducts to get at pure silver. [1]

## Researchers Find A New Process To Extract Silver From Solar Panels 
Researchers have now found a novel way to extract high-purity silver from discarded solar panels, reducing burden on mining as the amount of ores depletes every year. NRDC. Developed by researchers from the University of Leicester, they do it from end-of-life solar panels using cheap, environmentally friendly solvents.

## Extracting Lead Materials from Ore
Usually, lead is found in conjunction with other metals such as silver and zinc. Lead materials are mined as a by product of these other more valuable metals. Extracting the lead materials from the ore is a multi-step process. First the lead ore is ground into small particles that are less than 0.1mm, giving the ore a texture similar to table salt.

## Extraction of Metals from Ores - Different Processes Involved - VEDANTU
The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls. In these drums, the ore is ground to a fine slurry or powder.
