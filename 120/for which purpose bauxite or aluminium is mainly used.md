## What is the Difference Between Bauxite and Aluminum
Unlike some metal ores, bauxite is normally in good conditions, therefore, need less processing to purify it. This bauxite is then converted to alumina by chemical processes. Aluminum can be separated from alumina by an electrolysis process (Hall process). Bauxite is used as an abrasive, for cement, chemicals, makeup and other products.

Today, most of the cryolite used is synthetic rather than the naturally occurring mineral. [Pg.375] Finally, corundum is indirectly a major source of aluminum metal.

Namrata Das. Bauxite is a material that occurs naturally and is heterogeneous in nature. It is composed primarily of one or more aluminium hydroxide minerals, along with various mixtures of silica, iron oxide, titania, aluminosilicate, and other impurities in traces. Bauxite, despite being often considered a mineral, is actually a rock.
