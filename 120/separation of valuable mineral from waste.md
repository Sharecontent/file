## mineral processing | metallurgy | Britannica
In order to separate the valuable components of an ore from the waste rock, the minerals must be liberated from their interlocked state physically by comminution. As a rule, comminution begins by crushing the ore to below a certain size and finishes by grinding it into powder, the ultimate fineness of which depends on the fineness of dissemination of the desired mineral.

## Ore Sorting vs. Dense Medium Separation In Mineral Processing
Benefits Of Dense Medium Separation. While dense medium separation can only rely on density to distinguish valuable materials from waste, it has the advantage of being able to sort a wider range of particle sizes. With ore sorting, the largest particle size should be no more than 3 times that of the smallest particle.

Extracting lithium from petroleum brine is exponentially faster and more environmentally friendly than solar evaporation. It's also a less expensive way of harvesting lithium than conventional hard-rock mining.

In mining, tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.. The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which
