Although the structure of the jaw crusher is different, its working principle is the same, that is, the material is crushed by the periodic reciprocating motion of the movable jaw. In the process of swinging the movable jaw to the fixed jaw around the suspension mandrel, the material between the two jaw plates will be crushed, split and bent.

1. Working principle of jaw crusher The jaw crusher drives the belt and pulley through the motor, and the eccentric shaft makes the movable jaw move up and down. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the toggle plate and the movable jaw becomes larger, thereby pushing the movable jaw plate and the fixed jaw plate to approach.
