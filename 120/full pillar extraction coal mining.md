In room-and-pillar mining, coal deposits are mined by cutting a network of 'rooms' into the coal seam and leaving behind 'pillars' of coal to support the roof of the mine.  Longwall mining involves the full extraction of coal from a section of the seam, or 'face' using mechanical shearers. The coal 'face' can vary in length

## Fracturing of an Euler-Bernoulli beam in coal mine pillar extraction 
There are two stages in pillar extraction [1]. In the first stage several pillars are extracted and replaced by snooks. The load on each snook is increased as more and more pillars are extracted. When a snook fails, it fails violently. After about seven or eight pillars have been extracted the snooks fail.

## Coal Mining - Methods of Extraction - Underground Mining
Operating in a "room and pillar" (also known as "bord and pillar") system—where the mine is divided into a series of 20-to-30 foot (5-10 m) "rooms" or work areas cut into the coalbed—it can mine as much as five tons of coal a minute, more than a non-mechanised mine of the 1920s would produce in an entire day.

## Rib pillar extraction - An alternative to longwalling and shortwalling
Abstract. Three mining methods for full extraction in flat coal seams - i.e., longwall (LW), shortwall (SW), and rib pillar extraction (RPE) - are compared with each other in view of the introduction of a mechanized, self-advancing roof support. Features are shown according to which RPE appears most attractive under certain conditions.
