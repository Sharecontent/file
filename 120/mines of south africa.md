ABSTRACT As expensive as 3D seismic reflection surveys are, their high cost is justified by improved imaging of certain ore horizons in some of the Witwatersrand basin gold mines . The merged historical 3D seismic reflection data acquired for Kloof and South Deep mines forms an integral part of their Ventersdorp Contact Reef mine planning and development programme.
