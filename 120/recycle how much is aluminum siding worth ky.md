We only have the choice of one yard locally.they pay 45 cents/lb. Aluminum siding weighs in the 40-50lbs per square range ( 100 square feet ), and even a typical small home will have 12-15 squares..a larger two story will have 20-25 or more.so you could have between 200 and 500 bucks in scrap metaldepending on your local prices. One thing to check..some siding had a fiberboard or foam glued to the back of it for insulation and to increase stiffness.
