What Is The Concentration Or Enrichment Of Ore Explain. This process is called concentration of the ore. For this, (i) concentration or centrifugation on the basis of the difference in the densities (ii) froth flotation and (iii) magnetic separation methods are used. i. Froth floatation method is used for concentration of the ores of the metals whose ores are in sulphide form.

## different methods used in concentration of ores
This method is used for the concentration of sulphide ores. This method is based on the preferential wetting of ore particles by oil and that of gangue by water .. As a result. the ore particles become light and rise to the top in the form of froth while the gangue particles become heavy and settle down. Thus. adsorption is involved in this method.

The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## Concentration of Ore: Definition, Classification, Methods - Embibe
Aug 29, 2022Ores found on the earth contains many impurities like sand, rocks, and grit in them, which are collectively known as "Gangue".The concentration of ore is a method of removing gangue particles or other impurities in order to purify the ore. This process is also called Ore-dressing and benefaction.It is a very crucial step to obtain a pure metal from ore and to extract the metal.

Extraction of metals involves three major steps: Concentration of Ore. Isolation of metal from the concentrated Ore. Purification of the metal. Isolation of metal from the concentrated Ore involves the refining of metals from the compounds. The first step is to convert an ore into an oxide. Then the oxide is reduced using a reducing agent.

The combination of gangue with flux in ores forms a fusible material called Slag. The concentration of ore is the process of eliminating gangue from the ore. Depending on the nature of the procedure, it can be carried out in the following ways. Gravity Separation - This method is based on the difference in the gravities of ore and gangue particles.
