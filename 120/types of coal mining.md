## What are the main methods of mining? - American Geosciences Institute
PDF version. There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining. Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits. Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits. Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river

## Mining 101 - West Virginia Coal Association
There are four basic types of coal: Lignite, subbituminous, bituminous and anthracite. Lignite is the lowest rank of coal with the lowest energy content. Lignite is crumbly and has high moisture content. Lignite accounts for about 7% of U.S. coal production. Subbituminous coal has a higher heating value than lignite.

## Coal Mining and its Types? - Materials101
Coal mining are broadly divided into two broad methods . They are Surface Mining and underground mining. The process of choosing the type of method used, depends on the economic, technology and value of coal mining. Surface Mining. Surface mining does contain a lot of work and procedure and lets list the different methods. Contour Strip Mining. Area Strip Mining. Open Pit Mining.

Crushing equipment is particularly useful for strip mining, which uses open-pit mining to locate and extract coal or ore. In these mining operations, conveyors bring the materials to the mining trucks for transport. Crushing equipment lowers the use of excavated resources while eliminating the material amount at the site. Earthmovers

2. Coal Mining is the term that encompasses the physical extraction or removal of coal from the Earth's Surface. When coal is used as fuel in power generation, it is referred to as Steaming or Thermal coal while those which are used to create coke for steel manufacturing is referred to as Coking or Metallurgical Coal. Coal can be mined by both Surface and Underground Mining methods. Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed

Historically, Tennessee's most important mining products have been iron, bituminous coal, copper, lead, zinc, and phosphate. Iron ore was the most significant during early settlement years. Interest in the iron ore of the Western Highland Rim dates back to the 1790s and even earlier in the eastern mountains.

A mine opening is made by sinking a shaft down to the elevation of the coal seam. Mining is conducted using typically either longwall mining or room and pillar mining with continuous mining equipment. Coal is transported to the surface by a skip hoist. This is the most expensive type of underground mine to build and operate.

Drift mines enter horizontally into the side of a hill and mine the coal within the hill. Slope mines usually begin in a valley bottom, and a tunnel slopes down to the coal to be mined. Shaft mines are the deepest mines; a vertical shaft with an elevator is made from the surface down to the coal. In western Kentucky, one shaft mine reaches 1,200 feet below the surface. In room and pillar mining, the most common type of underground coal mining, coal seams are mined by a continuous miner that

Mining operations generally followed the pattern established in other coal regions, with drift, shaft, and slope mines being the most typical types. In drift mines, miners dug into outcroppings and followed coal seams along a relatively level path. These mines were easy to navigate but produced relatively little coal.

## coal mining | Definition, History, Types, & Facts | Britannica
The oldest of the basic underground methods, room-and-pillar mining grew naturally out of the need to recover more coal as mining operations became deeper and more expensive. During the late 1940s, conventional techniques began to be replaced by single machines, known as continuous miners, that broke off the coal from the seam and transferred it back to the haulage system.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

Coal is a fossil fuel that is, essentially, "the altered remains of prehistoric vegetation," as the World Coal Association (WCA) puts it. However, there are a number of different coal types. Coal originally began to form during the Carboniferous period, which took place between 360 and 290 million years ago. Put simply, plant matter accumulated in swamps and peat bogs, and

Uses of Coal. It is mainly used to generate heat and electricity. It is used in households and in industries to accomplish various tasks. It is the cheapest source of power fuel. The iron and steel industry depends heavily on fossil fuel for energy. It is also used to produce useful products such as coke, tar, and coal gas.
