This process is called 'comminution' or 'size reduction.'. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Most mineral processing operations are conducted with water as the medium; this is called wet processing against dry processing. Crushing, grinding, milling, and vibration (feeding) are examples of comminution processes.

Abstract. The size to which particles are reduced is governed by three criteria: the particle size of the mineral grains in an ore which are to be liberated for later separation and collection into a concentrate; and. the exposure of mineral grains for dissolution by a leaching process which is to follow.

At most metallic mineral processing plants, each process operation requires several types of equipment. A single crushing operation likely includes a hopper or ore dump, screen(s), crusher, surge bin, apron feeder, and conveyor belt transfer points. Emissions from these various pieces of equipment are often ducted to a single control device.
