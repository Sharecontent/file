Graphite ore flotation treatment. Crystalline graphite has good natural floatability, so froth flotation would be best for processing it. Since the size of graphite flakes is one of its most important quality indicators, a multi-stage grinding and multi-beneficiation process is adopted to remove large flake graphite as soon as possible.

## Graphite Beneficiation Process - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Graphite Beneficiation Process Market Specifications. Crucible grade flake graphite has a size range of 20 to 50 mesh and contains 83 to 90 per cent carbon. Production Problems. The production of a coarse, tough flake product with the desired impurity removal is necessary. Flotation is successful, but special reagents may be necessary to
