## Pros and cons of indexable tools | Cutting Tool Engineering
Cemented-carbide cutting tools have been in use since the late 1920s and are now ubiquitous in the metalcutting world. Around 1950, tools that accept cemented-carbide inserts became common in metalworking and are still considered a basic necessity. Indexable cutters are typically constructed of a steel body that has machined features, allowing for the accurate positioning of inserts.
