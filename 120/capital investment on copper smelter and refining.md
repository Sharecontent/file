## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Feb 14, 2021The ore (containing copper) is mined from the earth and ground into powder. It is then enriched and concentrated, after which the enriched ore is roasted in air at temperatures between 500 and 700 degrees celsius. The copper-ore is then further refined by smelting it into a liquid, blowing air into it and refining it using electrolysis.
