## Learning Geology: Iron Ore - Blogger
The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## iron processing - Iron making | Britannica
The scarcity of coking coals for blast-furnace use and the high cost of coke ovens are two reasons for the emergence of this other alternative iron-making process. Smelting reduction employs two units: in the first, iron ore is heated and reduced by gases exiting from the second unit, which is a smelter-gasifier supplied with coal and oxygen.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

The burning coal remained separate from the iron ore and so did not contaminate the iron with impurities like sulfur and ash. This opened the way to increased iron production.

## Vision-based size classification of iron ore pellets using ensembled 
Framework overview. The framework of the proposed iron ore pellet size analysis system consists of three steps: (1) acquisition of image from an area inside the disc where the pellets are distinguishable to the naked eye; (2) preprocessing of the acquired images to create a dataset to be used for model training; (3) classification of pellets into different categories by using an ensemble model
