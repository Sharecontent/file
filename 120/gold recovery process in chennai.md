## Gold Recovery : 8 Steps (with Pictures) - Instructables
Step 1: Extracting Gold From Scraps. Collect any gold-containing metal scraps to which you have access, including jewelry, computer processors, old telephone wiring or gold tooth crowns. Keep in mind that outdated electronics are likelier to produce parts with a high enough level of gold to make the procedure worthwhile.

Pre-19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthur-Forrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.

A process for treating refractory ores combines pressure oxidation treatment of the ore with cyanidation and carbon-in-pulp recovery. Pressure oxidation is carried out under acidic conditions, at elevated temperatures and pressure. Before cyanidation, the oxidized slurry is subjected to a multiple stage washing operation to remove excess acid and heavy metals generated during the pressure

Recover additional value from a gold plant. Fine carbon, loaded with gold, is generated from both the absorption circuit and elution circuits during the Carbon In Pulp (CIP) or Carbon In Leach (CIL) mineral recovery process. The fine carbon, once recovered, cannot be re-introduced into the process plant, and is consequently often a waste stream.

Gold Recovery Process. For gold recovery, water and a cyanide such as calcium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or potassium cyanide, are added to ore or scraps to form a slurry. The gold will leach out and mix with the cyanide into a solution. Activated carbon is then used to separate and store the gold, which is removed as the final step of the process.
