indiana. Clay is generally pretty forgiving when building a pond or lake . Limestone can be an issue in my area as it is porous and leaks can develop later . When building one in an area where limestone is present I do as Dozerboy suggested, over dig the bottom then bring back 1to 2 feet of clay packing it back in. Bentonite is a clay which belongs to the 70% h igh-disperse porous.

Bentonite - A flow diagram for bentonite processing is provided in Figure 11.25-5. Mined bentonite first is transported to the processing plant and stockpiled. If the raw clay has a relatively high moisture content (30 to 35 percent), the stockpiled material may be plowed to facilitate air drying to a moisture content of 16 to 18 percent.

Bentonite, originally known as "mineral soap" or "soap clay," was named "bentonite" in 1898 by Wilbur C. Knight for deposits in the Benton Shale near Rock River, Wyoming.  Limestone is exposed along the flanks of mountain ranges and is a significant source of crushed stone. Limestone is the preferred rock for highway construction

## Processing Bentonite
Bentonite - A flow diagram for bentonite processing is provided in Figure 11.25-5. Mined bentonite first is transported to the processing plant and stockpiled. If the raw clay has a relatively high moisture content (30 to 35 percent), the stockpiled material may be plowed to facilitate air drying to a moisture content of 16 to 18 percent.

## Process Development Essential to Bentonite Processing Operations
Drying Bentonite. Bentonite, as mined, typically contains between 25-35% moisture and requires drying to 5% to 12%. This is often accomplished through the use of a rotary drum dryer. While drying can be a fairly straightforward task in mineral processing, bentonite requires special attention, as overdrying risks diminished performance of the clay.
