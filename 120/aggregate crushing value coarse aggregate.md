## Coarse Aggregate: Characteristics & Density | What is Coarse Aggregate 
A coarse aggregate is a granular material or particle that have a diameter greater than 0.19 inch. These coarse aggregates generally fall in the range of 3/8 inch and less than two inches in diameter.

## What is Fineness Modulus of Coarse Aggregates?
The fineness modulus of coarse aggregates uses an index number to reflect the average particle size in the coarse aggregate. Using common sieves, sieve analysis is used to calculate it. The value of a fine aggregate is calculated by adding and subtracting the cumulative percentage of material retained on each filter by 100. The fineness modulus
