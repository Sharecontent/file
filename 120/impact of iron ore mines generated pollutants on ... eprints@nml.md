## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

Steel is made from a process whose basic ingredient is iron ore. During mining, some harmful chemicals like cyanide are usedForest Service) were served against Mountain Copper Company for severe air pollution from open-air heap roasting () and smelters () at the site, which denuded the vegetation for 14.4 km south, 5.6 km

## Environmental impact of iron ore mining
Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3). Hematite and magnetite are the most common

## How to Control Pollution in Mining Industry?
Following measures are, in general in practice for prevention and control of air pollution in mining industry: (i) Dust suppression through heavy duty sprinklers/road watering tracks is being done at various sensitive points such as haul roads, coal/ore handling points, crushing and screening plants etc.; (ii) Dust extraction facilities are
