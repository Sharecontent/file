## steps for portland cement manufacture
Portland cement manufacturing is an energy intensive process in which cement is made by grinding and heating a mixture of raw materials such as limestone, clay, sand, and iron ore in a rotary kiln. The kiln is a large furnace that is fueled by coal, oil, gas, coke and/or various waste materials. outline the steps of manufacturing portland cement

## How Portland Cement is Made? Manufacturing Process of Portland Cement
Portland cement can be made by following two different processes - a dry one and a wet one. Joseph Aspdin first made portland cement in his kitchen stove in England in the 19th century. Lime and silica make up approximately 85% of portland cement. The materials that are commonly used are limestone, shells, chalk, shale, clay, slate, silica sand, and iron ore.

The distinct types of portland cement are defined through ASTM C150-21: Standard Specification for Portland Cement, which distinguishes them by purpose. The standard types of portland cement are: Type I - for general purpose. Type IA - same as Type I, but when air entrainment is desired. Type II - for moderate sulfate resistance.

## What is Portland Cement and How it is Manufactured?
Portland Cement (PC) is a fine powder which is produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln and forms clinker. The clinker is grinded to fine powder with addition of small amount of other materials. It is the most commonly used types of cement in the world. It is used as basic ingredients of concrete, mortar, stucco etc.

Raw Materials of Cement. Most important raw materials (what is cement made of) required in the manufacture of Portland Cement are: Limestone, Clay, Gypsum, Fuel, and Water (in wet method). 1. Limestones: These are sedimentary, calcium carbonate rocks (CaC0 3 ). Most commonly they contain a small amount of magnesium carbonate also.

## How concrete is made - material, manufacture, making, how to make, used 
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple. First, the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared. Next, the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel), admixtures (chemical additives), any necessary fibers, and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete. The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed
