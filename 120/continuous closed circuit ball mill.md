Nov 18, 2016 Ball grinding mill Closed-circuit systems News Date: 13:09:02. The efficiency of the early stages of grinding in a ball mill is much greater than that for formation of ultra-fine particles, so ball mills operate most efficiently by making a coarse product, the fine fractions of this then being separated, and the coarse part being returned to the mill inlet.

As a common grinding equipment in cement plants and thermal power plants, ball mills have simple operation in the grinding process and good continuous working performance. The ball mill grinding system is divided into open-circuit grinding and closed-circuit grinding in the process. Many manufacturers have questions about these two systems when choosing.

## Batch Mill Grinding VS Continuous Grinding Compared
When the amount of ore in the mills was the same, no appreciable difference between batch and continuous open-circuit ball-mill grinding was found. This should be so, because the progression in particle size for the duration of a batch run would be expected to be the same as the progression from the feed to the discharge ends in a continuous run.
