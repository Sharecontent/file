## Natural Language Processing (NLP): What Is It & How Does it Work?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that makes human language intelligible to machines. NLP combines the power of linguistics and computer science to study the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems (run on machine learning and NLP algorithms) capable of understanding, analyzing

## How Does Gold Processing Work
This process does not result in gold that is 100 pure, but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities. the problem with this method is the release of the mercury vapor into the environment. even if the equipment is used to catch the vapor, some still can get into the atmosphere. mercury also can get into the soil and water if it still is.

## how does gold processing work
Once extracted, the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation, amalgamation, cyanidation, or carbon-in-pulp. Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore, and more than one process may be used on the same batch of gold ore. Mining

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules. First, ore is ground into an extremely fine powder. The powdered ore is mixed with water to create a slurry, which is mixed with surfactants to increase the gold's hydrophobicity. This mixture is placed into a large tank filled with distilled water.

In the lab, this process is called "gravity separation.". Sluice boxes are designed to mimic this naturally occurring gravity separation. As water carries gold-laden sediment through the box, small obstructions called riffles block the free flow of material.

## How Gold Electroplating Is Done - Sharretts Plating Company
In all gold plating, the part is polished and cleaned as thoroughly as possible before the electroplating process starts. Gold plating will look uneven and smudged if the surface is dirty, oily, scratched or otherwise damaged. Modern electroplating begins with the creation of a metal salt using the plating metal, typically gold or silver.

## Activated Carbon in Gold Cyanidation - FEECO International Inc.
The gold cyanidation process is a primary method of gold beneficiation. Activated carbon is a critical component in the beneficiation of gold ore, allowing this widespread process to occur because of its ability to recover gold from the gold-cyanide complex. Depending on the deposit, some silver ores may also be processed via cyanidation.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
