Mix Ratio = 1:2:4. Total sum of ratio =1+2+4 =7. Wet volume of concrete = 1 m 3. To get dry volume, wet volume increased by 54%. Dry volume of concrete = 1 + 0.54. Dry volume of concrete = 1.54. 4. Volume Increased by 54%. The reason behind the volume increase by 54% is dry aggregate, sand and cement have air voids.

## cement volumes for m10 grade concrete
how to calculate sand cement volumes for m10 grade concrete. Sand = 0.472 m3; Cement = 8.22 Bag. Some important conclusion from above . 8 bag of Cement is required for 1cum of concrete work in M20. 4.4 bag of cement is required for 1cum of concrete work in M10. Volume of dry concrete =1.54 times volume of wet concrete.
