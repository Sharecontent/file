## Iron Ore: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and

Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.

The two main methods of recycling iron from iron ore tailings are magnetizing roasting and direct reduction. Magnetizing roasting uses temperatures between 700 and 900 °C for a time of under 1 hour to produce an iron concentrate (Fe 3 O 4) to be used for iron smelting.

## mining - Underground mining | Britannica
When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface, the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive, and underground techniques must be considered. Counting against underground mining are the costs, which, for each ton of material mined, are much higher underground than on the surface.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined - Realonomics
Iron ore deposits may lie deep underground. A shaft must be dug from the surface and an elevator or hoist must be installed. . Stopes are the chambers in which ore is broken and mined.  It is therefore essential for the production of steel which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
