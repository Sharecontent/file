It involves drilling a section of ore at the very bottom of the deposit and then blasting to make the roof collapse. Gravity then takes over, as the ore above the blast site fractures and collapses in succession as support is withdrawn.

## Underground Mining for Ore | Axora
Underground mining involves the excavation of ore bodies lying deep beneath the surface, which surface mining would have to remove huge amounts of waste in order to reach. By contrast, underground mining produces minimal waste. But it's more costly because the equipment is much smaller than the equipment used in, for example, open-pit mining.

Surface mining, which includes strip mining, open-pit mining, and mountaintop removal, removes soil and rock from on top of the mineral deposit. It may begin as soon as the pre-development steps are complete. Underground mining uses shafts and tunnels to access deeply-buried mineral deposits, while the overlying rock is left in place.

The copper deposit mined by Kennecott was very high grade and the copper sulfides were found in conjunction with carbonate minerals. These carbonate minerals reacted to neutralize acid mine drainage.The high grade of copper (average 13%) meant that relatively little waste was produced by the mine, especially since much of the rich ore was removed selectively by pickaxe.

## Copper Mining Process | Operations | Minto Explorations
The Minto mine commenced Yukon mining operations in 2007 as an open pit mine. In 2012 the company began underground development on the Minto South Deposits while continuing to mine additional open pits as the primary mining method. Today, the mining is entirely underground, and we are currently producing in the Copper Keel ore body.

##  Recovery of Copper by Solution Mining Methods - Arizona
A Brief History of Copper Recovery by Solu-tion Mining Methods As early as the 1670, copper-bearing mine waters at the Rio Tinto mine in Spain were known to chemically precipitate copper onto iron (Arbiter and Fletcher, 1994). This process became known as the "cementation process", which is apparently derived from the Spanish word
