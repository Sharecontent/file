## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Before concentration can begin, ore must be crushed or milled to liberate gold particles from rock and to decrease grain size. Concentration works best when grain size of the milled material or sediment is relatively consistent, so that most particles are of similar size. An appropriate grain size can be achieved using screens or sieves.
