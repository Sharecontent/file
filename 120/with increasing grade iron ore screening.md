Iron ore. Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite.

## Does low grade ore mean low performance? - Process productivity
Work towards ideal sinter performance, even with a low grade ore. If you understand the properties of your ore, and what you can and can't do with it, then you can optimise performance. Key to this is to avoid making an immediate value judgement — on the basis of chemistry — that the presence of certain impurities will have a negative

A total of 6 parallel lines process 9500 t/h of ore. Screening equipment is installed after the primary crusher, after the scrubber and after the tertiary comminution stage to separate the iron ore into a dry coarse fraction (8 - 40 mm) and a wet fine fraction (> 1 - < 8 mm). The fraction < 1 mm passes through another washing stage.
