Therefore, the supply of good quality coal in useable form is one of the crucial operations in a thermal power plant. This can be achieved in a coal-handling plant (CHP), which processes coal and supplies it in the required size and quality using its several auxiliaries. 1 Wagons are used for carrying coals from mines to the coal plants where

## Calculation of coal handling plant and bunker capacity
Buker capacity is generally designed for 12-14 hours of full load operation. Let us calculate with 12 hours of operation hours. Coal consumption in 12 hours = 392 X 12 /24 =196 MT. Volume of bunker = 196 X 1000/800 = 245 M3. Take 10% of extra margin on bunker as some of coal stucked on bunker wall surface cannot be used for Boiler.
