## Coal Mining - Methods of Extraction - Modern Surface Mining
Modern Surface Mining. When coal seams are near the surface, it may be economical to extract the coal using open cut (also referred to as open cast, open pit, or strip) mining methods. Open cast coal mining recovers a greater proportion of the coal deposit than underground methods, as more of the coal seams in the strata may be exploited.

## Coal Mining - Methods
Until the 1960s, when technology changed the way coal could be removed, accessing buried coal in Western Canada involved digging a tunnel near a seam. Branching off this main tunnel were smaller passages that ran in the seam and allowed miners to retrieve the coal.  This section explores the most common methods of coal mining in the early

## How do we get coal? New technologies to extract a crucial resource
Coal is one of the cheapest and most reliable sources of energy, and as demand soars new technology will be crucial. With global demand for coal widely expected to rise over the next 20 years, Dr Gareth Evans finds out how a range of new technologies will help the coal mining industry meet that need - from both existing and less conventional

Most underground coal is mined by the room and pillar method, where by rooms are cut into the coal bed leaving a series of pillars, or columns of coal, to help support the mine roof and control the flow of air.Generally, rooms are 2,000 feet wide and the pillars up to 300 feet wide. At least 60 feet of coal was left between an underground mine and the surface, if not the surface had a higher

Coal Mining Technologies. Surface mining of coal requires areas of land to be temporarily disturbed, which raises a number of environmental challenges. As coal mining is only a temporary use of land, a rehabilitation or reclamation plan is designed for each mine covering the period from the start of operations until well after mining has finished.

## USB2 - Inclined layered solid-filling mining method in  - Google
In an inclined layered solid-filling mining method in an ultrathick coal layer, tunnels and equipment are arranged according to a solid-filling mining method. An artificial roof for a lower layer is formed by metal meshes and bamboo fences of a first layer a solid-filling mining method. The method is repeated, until the entire ultrathick coal layer is finished.
