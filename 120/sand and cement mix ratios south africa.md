The best all around concrete mix ratio for almost all residential work is 3500 psi. The concrete mix ratio to create 3500 psi concrete is 1:2.5:3. This means 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts stone. Different strength concrete mixes have different ratios. I recommend using Portland cement but any brand cement will work.

## Concrete Mix Design | Different Grades of Concrete - CIVIL READ
To make ease in understanding we are finding the Concrete mix design of M20 grade concrete. The Concrete mix ratio for M20 grade of concrete is 1:1.5:3 that mean 1 part of cement, 1.5 part of sand (fine aggregate) and 3 parts of aggregate (crushed stone) in volume and then batched for mixing. To know the Concrete Mix Design follow below:-.
