The iron and steel plants lasted until the 1980s, when they were shut down as part of a major restructuring of the sector nationally. BHP 's rivals focused on the Pilbara for their early investments in downstream processing. Hamersley Iron (now Rio Tinto) built a 2 million tonnes per annum pellet plant at Dampier in the late 1960s.

## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

IRON FROM THE BLAST FURNACE • Iron tapped from the blast furnace (called pig iron) contains over 4% C, plus other impurities: 0.3-1.3% Si, 0.5-2.0% Mn, 0.1-1.0% P, and 0.02-0.08% S • Further refinement is required for cast iron and steel - A furnace called a cupola is commonly used for converting pig iron into gray cast iron - For steel

## how does iron ore wet processing plant work
Iron Ore. Efficiently remove silica and alumina contamination to increase efficiencies in steel production. Our iron ore wet processing plants are proven to successfully deal with silica and alumina contamination in the iron ore, resulting in an increase in the Fe value of the iron ore thereby increasing the efficiency of the steel production process.
