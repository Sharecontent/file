Calculating shaft diameter Engineering Stack Exchange. When designing the shaft for the bending moment, we can apply the formula shown: M e = ( π ÷ 32) ∗ σ b ∗ d 3. Where σ b = Ultimate/Allowable Stress. Substituting the numbers into the first equation M e equation and then equate both of the M e values. You can then solve for d.

## Minecraft Stack Calculator | How Many Stacks?
In Minecraft, wheat stacks to 64. Knowing the maximum stack size to be 64, we can calculate that 250 wheat translates to: floor (250/64) = floor (3.906) = 3 stacks. .and an additional semi-full stack of: 250 % 64 = 58. Our wheat farm would therefore produce 3 stacks and 58 units of wheat every hour.
