## How adding rock dust to soil could help drive carbon into  - Greenbiz
Adding rock dust to agricultural lands speeds up the chemical reactions that lock carbon up — for thousands of years — in soil. If applied to croplands globally, rock dust could theoretically help suck an estimated 2 billion to 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air every year, between 34 percent and 68 percent of the global

Adding glacial rock dust helps restore these mineral imbalances. This is done by putting them in an easy access form for soil microbes to break apart. Thus, allowing them to be simple for plant roots to absorb. When ground into a fine powder and added to vegetable or flower gardens, the minerals in the dust become accessible to the plant roots.

## Basalt Rock - Formation, Properties, Uses, Construction and FAQs - VEDANTU
Basalt is an extrusive igneous or volcanic rock that has a low silica content, dark in colour, and is very rich in iron and magnesium. Basalt rock is mainly composed of pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase and is the most common rock on the earth's surface. The texture of basalt rocks is coarsely porous as those holes are left by gas bubbles.

Limestone, what farmers use now, sequesters some carbon, but basalt does it better.

Basalt rock dust is a natural soil amendment that is made from volcanic rocks. Basalt is a dark igneous rock, and it contains a very low level of toxins, hence, it is extremely good for plant growth. Basalt is strongly found in the earth's crust and especially in the oceanic basins. It holds great importance among the rocks found on earth.

The general principle is to spread three tons of volcanic rock dust per acre, which comes to about 1.25 pounds per square yard. In the metric system, this comes up to 750 grams per meter. Therefore, you should plan on about 10 to 15 pounds of rock dust being enough to re-mineralize a hundred square feet of garden space for up to three years.
