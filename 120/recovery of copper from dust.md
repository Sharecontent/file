## Recovery of copper from dump slag by a segregation process
The segregation process was discovered accidentally in 1923, when an oxide copper ore containing chloride was reduced with coal [1]. In basic terms, segregation roasting consists of heating copper ore to Â°C with 1-6% of a chlorinating agent and 2-4% carbonaceous reducing agent. The metals are converted to volatile chlorides, which

## Recovery of Copper from Flue Dust Generated in e-Waste  - SpringerLink
A flue dust that contains valuable metals is generated during smelting operation for e-waste treatment. However, metal recovery from this flue dust has not been extensively studied. The flue dust can contain valuable metals such as gold, silver, copper, and iron. In this study, the flue dust from e-waste was investigated as the potential metal resource for obtaining valuable metals, including

Copper smelting slag is produced from copper pyrometallurgy (both smelting and converting stages), usually grading at 0.3-3%. The slag may also contains lead & zinc minerals like galena, sphalerite. Copper mainly dwells in the slag in the form of bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, and metallic copper. The rest are iron minerals like magnetic

Therefore, the recovery of valuable metals from the copper slags presents both economic and environmental incentives [10,11,12,13,14]. During the past two decades, attempts have been made to develop methods for metal recovery from copper slags including flotation, magnetic separation, leaching, and roasting [11,12,13,14].

Similar copper recovery was achieved when flotation test was performed with tap water and treated waste brine. Therefore, treated waste brine could provide a suitable water quality required in the froth flotation process as an alternative non-conventional water resource.  which is mainly used in mineral processing and dust suppression [1,2].

A soluble chloride is added to the sulphate solution of copper and the proper amount of sulphurous acid is added. Moderate heat under pressureâ90Â° C. of heatâprecipitated almost all the copper as sub-chloride. The subsequent process of obtaining the copper without volatilization and the recovery of the chlorine offered difficulties.

## Dynamics of Distribution Boundaries of Epiphytic Macrolichens after 
The copper smelter has been operating since 1940. The main emission ingredients are sulfur oxides and dust particles with heavy metals (Cu, Fe, Cd, Zn, Pb, etc.) and metalloids (As) sorbed on them. In 1980, plant emissions amounted to 225 000 t per year. The emission reduction began in the late 1980sâearly 1990s.

## Studies on the recovery of copper from the dust generated in copper 
The dust samples were roasted in the air with H2SO4 at 80 o C for 2 h. In comparison to the raw sample, the roasted dust sample showed better selectivity for the recovery of copper. The leaching of copper more selective with the roasting temperature from 600 to 900 o C with a simultaneous decrease in iron leaching.
