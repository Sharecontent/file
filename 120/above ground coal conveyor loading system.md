## Falk Gearboxes & Coal Mine Conveyers
The invention of belt, chain and roller conveyors that use Falk gearboxes facilitated transport from underground to the surface, inspection and maintenance. The Falk gearbox was in part responsible for the Bull Mountain Coal Field's reopening. Gearboxes on the mine's 4,000-foot conveyor supplied the plant's primary fuel.
