## the names of the ores of iron in india
Name the best variety of iron ore found in india . In India we get four types of iron ores, viz. (a) hematite (Fe203), magnetite (limonite (), and siderite (Fe2C03). The hematite ore or redochre is called 'oxÂ­ide of iron'. It has ferrous content ranging from 60 to 70%. It is mainly found in the Dharwad and Cuddapah rocks of the Peninsular India.
