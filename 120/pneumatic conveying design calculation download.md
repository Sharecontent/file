## Pneumatic Conveying Systems - Coperion
Conveying Systems at a Glance. Pneumatic conveying is the transport of bulk solids through a pipe by using the flow of air or other gas. Typical bulk materials pneumatically conveyed are powders, pellets, granules and irregularly shaped particles smaller than 20 mm [0.75 in]. The majority of pneumatically transported materials have a bulk

As a general rule in pneumatic conveying, when sizing a system we look primarily at pressures, velocities and line loadings to determine best what the line size should be. For example a well sized dilute phase pressure system going 200 feet would probably run somewhere between 6-12 PSIG, have a terminal velocity of between 4,500 - 6,000 fpm

## Dense-Phase Pneumatic Conveying Systems
In pneumatic conveying, power consumption is a function of the system design, transfer rate, and convey length. Therefore, a conveying system that transfers 100 tn/hr of a bulk material over a distance of 200 m uses about the same amount of power as a system of the same design that conveys 200 tn/hr of the same material over a distance of 100 m.

The calculation for an air flow of 0.8 m3/sec indicated the beginning of sedimentation in the pipeline, due to the velocities becoming too low. From this calculation, it can be concluded that a pneumatic conveying design for the lowest possible energy demand, is also a design, using the lowest possible air flow (or velocity).

## pneumatic conveying calculations download
25 · The design of pneumatic conveying systems is usually car-ried out on the basis of scaling data obtained from the pneu-matic conveying of the material to be transported. If previ-ous experience of conveying a given material is not avail-able, data is generally derived for the purpose by conveying the material through a test facility.

## PneuCalc Design Software for Pneumatic Conveying Systems
I have used PneuCalc 7.0 to help verify, setup, and trouble shoot various pneumatic conveying systems.It was quick and easy giving the guidance needed for each project.This software will be another great tool for anyone that wants to understand the specifics of their pneumatic system air flow.
