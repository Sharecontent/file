## water demand of potash solution mining
Solution mining involves dissolution of the potash with water. Wells are drilled into the potash-bearing area (sylvinite bed) and water, later brine, is pumped down the wells to dissolve the potassium chloride (KCl) (potash product) and sodium chloride (NaCl) (waste salt) that is in the sylvinite bed.

## An Introduction to Saskatchewan Potash Solution Mining
Potash was first discovered in Saskatchewan in the early 1940s, while locals were drilling for oil. But it wouldn't be until a decade later, in the 1950s, that potash exploration kicked into high gear. Fast forward to today, and business is booming, with Canada exporting a whopping 95% of its potash to more than 50 countries worldwide.

Because potash (potassium chloride or other water-soluble potassium compounds) occurs mostly in sedimentary rock, mining it can be a very tricky business. When soft-rock mining is undertaken, there is always a very real risk of collapse, whether conventional methods like room and pillar (continuous) or solution mining techniques are used.
