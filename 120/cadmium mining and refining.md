Nickel-Cadmium batteries belong to the category of rechargeable batteries. Despite being invented and used for more than 100 years, they have lost a big market share from other rechargeable batteries, such as NiMH and Li-ion batteries. Nickel-cadmium battery recycling is important since in that way it is achieved their diversion from landfills
