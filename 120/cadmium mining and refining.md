Cadmium, a rare but widely dispersed element, is found naturally in the environment. Most cadmium ore (greenockite): occurs in association with zinc. It is released into the environment through mining and smelting, its use in various industrial processes, and enters the food chain from uptake by plants from contaminated soil or water.

Nickel-Cadmium batteries belong to the category of rechargeable batteries. Despite being invented and used for more than 100 years, they have lost a big market share from other rechargeable batteries, such as NiMH and Li-ion batteries. Nickel-cadmium battery recycling is important since in that way it is achieved their diversion from landfills
