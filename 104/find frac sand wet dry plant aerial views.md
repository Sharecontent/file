## Cut Frac Sand Cost, Improve Your ESG Score - Hart Energy
Impact on Cost of Sand Delivered — A typical frac sand mine has four operations: 1) excavating, 2) washing/sizing, 3) drying and 4) storage. Drying and vertical storage facilities are the plant's most operationally complex, expensive and labor-intensive operations. Total savings of $5- $10/ton comes primarily from variable cost savings for

With the ever increasing demand for energy, the amount of frac sand for the oil and gas industry has increased dramatically. CFS built many of the late 1970's and early 1980's plants for 20 x 40 and 30 x 50 mesh frac sands. We are now building some of the largest frac sand plants in the U.S. for this increased demand.
