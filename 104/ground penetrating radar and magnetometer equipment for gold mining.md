## Ground Penetrating Radar
Ground penetrating radar is a detection method that uses radio waves to identify buried or hidden objects within a structure or beneath the surface. This non-destructive method uses antennas of varying strengths to transmit a signal into a surface. As the signal encounters different components within that surface, it is bounced back to a receiver at the surface.

## Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) | Radiodetection
Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) uses radio waves to build a picture of what is below the surface. Ground Penetrating Radar sends out a pulse of radio energy which bounces off the buried object and is detected by the receiver. The results, showing the location and depth of buried objects, are displayed in real-time in the field or can be integrated into maps and other deliverables.

Basic Concept. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) uses a high-frequency (e.g. 40 to 1,500 MHz) EM pulse transmitted from a radar antenna to probe the earth. The transmitted radar pulses are reflected from various interfaces within the ground, and this return is detected by the radar receiver.

## Ground Penetrating Radar- Geophysical Land Products
View Products. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) systems transmit pulses of Electromagnetic energy into the ground or into a structure. The pulses of energy are in the form of waves which reside in the radio bandwidth (25MHz to 10GHz). These devices record the amplitude and travel time of waves which have been reflected back to the surface.
