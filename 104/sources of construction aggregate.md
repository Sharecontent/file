## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Feb 19, 2022Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

Because aggregate is a low unit-value, high-bulk-weight commodity, it must be obtained from nearby sources to minimize economic and environmental costs associated with transportation.

## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
