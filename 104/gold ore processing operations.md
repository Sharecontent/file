## Agglomeration Drums for Processing Gold Ore - FEECO International Inc.
The process of heap leaching extracts gold from ore by piling up crushed ore and applying a leaching agent to permeate through the pile, separating the gold from the ore. While this method has been used for decades with success, it has been greatly improved by the addition of an agglomeration drum to the process before the heap.
