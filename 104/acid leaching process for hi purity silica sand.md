## High purity quartz sand production line-Sinonine
In quartz sand processing and sand washing plant quartz raw ore or quartz sand needs to be purified to remove impurities, such as iron, aluminum trioxide, mica,etc., so as to obtain high purity quartz sand. The SiO2 content of quartz sand after processing can reach 99.9% or higher, and the iron content should be reduced to 30 ppm or lower, so as to meet different industrial use.

## Production of High-Purity Silica Sand from Ivorian Sedimentary Basin by 
To produce high-purity silica sand usable for glass making, the present study was carried out. The objective of this work was to increase the silicon dioxide (SiO2) content to at least 99% using a simple process without chemical input.  Innovative Technology for the Production of High-Purity Sand Silica by Thermal Treatment and Acid Leaching
