## Crushed Concrete Aggregate| Concrete Construction Magazine
When landfills located near populated areas started refusing broken concrete in the 1970s, the construction industry started crushing it to make aggregate for use as compactible fill. Wood and steel reinforcement were separated out, leaving aggregate that often included a mixture of concrete, brick, and asphalt, along with some dirt.

Both crushed bricks and natural aggregates were sieved and the 12.70 mm (0.5 in.) size was used as the coarse aggregate size in the mixture design.Type I cement with the chemical and phase compositions shown in Table 1 was used in all concrete batches. The mixture proportions were determined by volume, with coarse aggregate composing 35%, fine aggregate 25%, and water-to-cement ratio of 0.42.
