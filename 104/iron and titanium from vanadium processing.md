## Prediction Model for Vanadium Content in Vanadium and Titanium Blast 
A model for predicting the vanadium content in a molten iron blast furnace (BF) was developed to solve the problem of late iron detection during the smelting process of a vanadium and titanium BF. First, based on the whole process data platform of BF ironmaking, the standardized data warehouse of BF smelting was established, and the variables

## Making Vanadium | Vanitec
Ferrovanadium is available in alloys containing 40%, 60% or 80% vanadium. The 60% and 80% grades are mostly produced by the aluminothermic reduction of vanadium oxides in the presence of steel scrap or by direct reduction in an electric furnace. The 40% grade is produced from slag and other vanadium products by the silicon reduction process.
