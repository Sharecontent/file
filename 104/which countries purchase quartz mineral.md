Quartz is an unusual mineral. It is stable below 573 degrees Centigrade, but between 573 and 870 degrees, tridymite, (another silica mineral,) forms. At 1470 degrees, tridymite undergoes a structural rearrangement and becomes cristobalite, which is isometric. At 1710 degrees, cristobalite melts to a viscous liquid.
