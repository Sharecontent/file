An Overview of Utilization of Steel Slag - ScienceDirect. Copper slag is a by-product obtained during matte smelting and refining of copper. The common management options for copper slag are recycling, recovering of metal, production of value added products such as abrasive tools, roofing granules, cutting tools, abrasive, tiles, glass, road-base construction, railroad ballast, asphalt pavements.

## Utilization of Iron Ore Mines Waste as Civil Construction Material 
In iron and steel industry, Iron ore tailings (IOT) and slimes utilization is still an area of challenge, because of the low content of iron oxide present in them, which is unsuitable for metal extraction.  The materials are generally used in civil engineering construction for early development of strength in concrete. IOT is a low grade
