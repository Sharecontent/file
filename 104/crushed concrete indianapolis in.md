## Can You Pour Concrete Over Crushed Concrete? - House Caravan
New concrete can be poured over old concrete as long as it is done properly. About two inches thick of new concrete should be poured. Aside from that, it is recommended to use smaller aggregate and to use reinforcement like fiber into the concrete. If the slab is so thick that it makes it hard to use fiber, you can opt for a steel rebar.
