## Exploring the benefits of wet and dry grinding with the help of bead mill
Dry grinding allows the particles to head down to the size of a single-digit micron in general. The particles are therefore reduced down to the range of the bead grinding machine by the regular wet grinding method. Wet is the ideal way to achieve your required specifications, while the simplicity of dry grinding would often be considered as the

## What Are the Differences between Dry and Wet Type Ball Mill?
Jul 20, 2022The water can wash away the fine particles in time to avoid over-grinding. The wet ball mill has a low noise, and low environmental pollution. The wet ball mill has a simple transportation device with less auxiliary equipment, so the investment is about 5%-10% lower than that of a dry ball mill. The grinding particle size is fine and uniform.

## Can wet grinder be used for dry grinding?145
What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.
