## Bentonite Waterproofing | What are the problems with bentonite 
Bentonite waterproofing is an exterior waterproofing treatment that is supposed to work by forming a barrier between wet soil and the building foundation. Like any type of clay, bentonite absorbs moisture. As water molecules bond to clay particles, the clay expands, filling cracks and gaps in the foundation so that water can't get in.

## Vertical Impermeable Barriers (Cutoff Walls) | Geoengineer
Vertical barriers or "cutoff walls" are often used in geoenvironmental engineering to control the spread of contaminants. Cutoff walls in general can either be used to directly contain a contaminant by sealing it in from the outside environment or to manipulate the flow of groundwater to avoid contaminant transport through advection.Vertical barriers are often used along with surface caps

The GMZ bentonite used in this study was obtained from Gaomiaozi County, Inner Mongolia, China. The grain size distribution of this light-grey powder, with a maximum diameter of 200 μm, is shown in Fig. 1, and the X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Fig. 2.This bentonite consists of several minerals including 62% of montmorillonite, 25% of quartz, 6% of cristobalite and 6% of plagioclase.
