## A Review of the Scope of Artisanal and Small‐Scale Mining Worldwide 
ASM has operated for centuries as a small unorganized and informal activity. For example, Allchin discusses small- and large-scale gold mining that operated in India from 100 BCE to 300 CE. Similarly, "folk" mining in Colombia was an important source of gold for Spain from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries.

The legal form of ASM emerged in 1989 when a Small-Scale Gold Mining Act (PNDC Law 218) was passed to provide for the licensing of such operations in Ghana. The Minerals Commission and the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC) claim that less than 30 percent of the ASM operators in the country are duly registered and licensed (Aubynn, 2009).

This year's World Day Against Child Labour focused the world's attention on the plight of child labourers in small-scale mines and quarries. The ILO estimates that about one million children aged 5 to 17 are engaged in small-scale mining and quarrying activities worldwide. These children toil under dangerous conditions and go without access to schools, health clinics, and other basic necessities.

This project focuses on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) of minerals and gemstones globally and the illegal mining and transport of these natural resources. Project scientists employ field mapping, geomorphological techniques, and remote sensing to map, monitor, and evaluate mineral deposits and ASM activities in conflict zones and during complex emergencies.

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Mar 15, 2022Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.
