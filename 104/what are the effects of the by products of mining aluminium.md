 Aluminium showed adverse effects on the nervous system and resulted in loss of memory, problems with balance and loss of co-ordination (Krewski et al., 2009). People suffering from kidney diseases find it difficult to eliminate aluminium from the body, resulting in aluminium accumulation in the body leading to bone and brain damage.

Aluminium (aluminum in American and Canadian English) is a chemical element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminium has a density lower than those of other common metals, at approximately one third that of steel. It has a great affinity towards oxygen, and forms a protective layer of oxide on the surface when exposed to air

Australia is the largest producer of bauxite, with five large mines supplying around 30 per cent of global production. Bauxite mining has five steps:

In some cases, bioavailable metals are absorbed by plants and animals, causing detrimental effects. Although current U.S. mining and reclamation practices guided by environmental regulations minimize or prevent waste rock erosion into streams, disposal of waste rock in places where it could erode into surface drainages has occurred historically.

## Why recycle aluminium cans? | MY ZERO WASTE
1- Less energy. Compared to mining and smelting, recycling aluminium drink cans is far less energy intensive. Recycling aluminium requires only 5% of the energy and produces only 5% of the CO2 emissions as compared with primary production. A recycled aluminium can saves enough energy to run a television for three hours.
