Slate was mined in descending manner, leading to large rooms up to 100 m in height (Fig. 6.4 a, b). This method was named after the chief engineer of the mines Le Chatelier (Fig. 6.4 c) and firstly applied in the mine "Grand-Carreaux" in Trélazé and later adopted by other mines in this slate district.
