## Evolution of Blast Furnace Iron Making - IspatGuru
The metallic iron content of these ores ranges from approximately 30 % in the bog ores to 72 % in some hematites. All iron ores are mixed with other compounds in the earth which are undesirable in the smelting process. Beginning in the 1700s, iron ore was roasted with charcoal in open pits or enclosed kilns.

## Blast furnace process - tec-science
The unmelted iron ores still contain non-reduced iron oxides. An unfavourable accumulation of ores at the contact points can also make gas flow difficult and thus leave non-reduced iron ore behind. At the latest, however, when the melting process occurs in the deeper and hotter zones of the blast furnace, iron ores can be almost completely reduced.

The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production ).

But, before this, the ore goes through a blast furnace that only works when air can circulate freely. For this reason, the material needs to be big enough so that there are spaces between each piece.  Transforming iron ore into usable material is a long process.

## Blast furnace ironmaking process, Shanghai Metallurgy Technology Co.,Ltd.
The raw materials used in blast furnace smelting are mainly composed of iron ore, fuel (coke) and flux (limestone). Generally, smelting 1 ton of pig iron requires 1.5-2.0 tons of iron ore, 0.4-0.6 tons of coke, 0.2-0.4 tons of flux, a total of 2-3 tons of raw materials.

## The Blast Furnace - Iron Production
As the mixture of iron ore, coke and limestone heats, the hot waste gases are collected and cleansed. They are then used to help heat the air blast, required if blast furnace is to reach the high temperatures needed to produce molten iron. The stock level is constantly 'topped up'. Molten iron ore is 'tapped' at the bottom of the blast

## Extraction Of Iron - SlideShare
Steps of Extraction Step1: Concentration Step2: Calcination The ore is then heated in absence of air (calcined). This results in decomposition of carbonates into oxides and then ferrous oxide is converted into Ferric Oxide. FeCO 3 FeO CO 2 4 FeO O2 2 Fe 2 CO 3. 9.
