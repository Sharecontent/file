Clay, dust, silt or mud in aggregates because of inadequate washing at the aggregate source will produce lower strength concrete. 1. Crusher aggregates are not washed, thus they may contain a percentage of crusher dust. This dust if present as a coating around the larger aggregate will result in drop in strength of concrete.

## DTI: Dust Control at Concrete Crushing Facilities | BossTek
At concrete crushing facilities, dust is generated at multiple points. Front end loaders, hoppers, and conveyor discharge points all bring dust when operational. Front end loaders transfer the incoming demolition materials to the hopper. Picking up these rocks creates dust as they are disturbed and dumped into the hopper.

## Investment on concrete with stone crusher dust as fine aggregate
Fine aggregate is typically made from crushed stones, but some concrete companies also use stone crusher dust as a fine aggregate. One reason why stone crusher dust can be used as a fine aggregate in concrete is because it is very abrasive. This means that it can help to reduce the amount of required cement, which saves on costs.

## quarry dust as fine aggregate in concrete
To overcome this problem, present study is focused on the suitability to utilize the quarry dust in Self Compacting Concrete (SCC) partially as fine aggregate with the natural fine aggregates. In this work, quarry dust is used as replacement of sand in a different level (0%, 15%, 30%, 45% and 60%) for producing the SCC.

## Everything You Need To Know About Recycled Crushed Concrete
Generally, when it comes to transport and placement, you can treat recycled concrete much of the same way as you would conventional concrete unless you are using very fine aggregate. In this case, it needs to be handled more carefully. Recycled crushed concrete is suitable for a variety of different jobs, including:-Road construction-Curbs-Gutters
