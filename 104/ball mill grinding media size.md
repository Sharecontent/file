Figure 3 depicts the effects of media size on grinding times. From this plot, it is shown that a target fineness of 80% < 2 microns is normally achieved in 315 minutes of recirculation milling with 1.0 to 1.4 mm grinding media. By reducing the media diameter to 0.6 to 0.8 mm after 90 minutes, the target grind is achieved in only 150 minutes.
