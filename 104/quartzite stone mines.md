## Quartz Stone Manufacturing Process: Everything You Need to Know
The manufacturing process involves a mixture of quartz aggregated chips pigments, additives, and resin binders. Engineered quartz stone for slab and countertop applications come in a wide array of colors, textures, and patterns. Depending on the manufacturing process, the texture can be either coarse or fine.

## Quartzite
Quartzite is a decorative stone and may be used to cover walls, as roofing tiles, as flooring, and stairsteps. Its use for countertops in kitchens is expanding rapidly. It is harder and more resistant to stains than granite. Crushed quartzite is sometimes used in road construction. [2]

Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.

Quartzite is a metamorphic rock derived from sandstone that is distinguished from sandstone by its fracture. Sandstone breaks along grain boundaries, whereas quartzite is so well indurated (hardened) that it breaks across constituent grains. The intense heat and pressure of metamorphism causes the quartz grains to compact and become tightly

quartzite, sandstone that has been converted into a solid quartz rock. Unlike sandstones, quartzites are free from pores and have a smooth fracture; when struck, they break through, not around, the sand grains, producing a smooth surface instead of a rough and granular one. Conversion of sandstone to quartzite may be accomplished by precipitation of silica from interstitial waters below Earth
