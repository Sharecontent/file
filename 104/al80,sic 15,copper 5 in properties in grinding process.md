## Which Grinding Wheel Should I Choose? | Norton
For this reason, finer grit sized wheels are required to grind hard materials and soft materials are best ground with medium to coarse grit size wheels. For most efficient operation, the grade must be adjusted to suit the hardness of the material. As a general guide, the harder the material, the softer the grade of wheel required.

## Grinding Wheel - Abrasives, Properties, Shape and Structures - ExtruDesign
Grinding Wheel. In the grinding process, an emery or corundum wheel is used as the cutting tool. Emery and corundum are naturally found abrasives and are impure forms of aluminium oxide Al 2 O 3.A grinding wheel is made up of thousands of tiny abrasive particles embedded in a matrix called the 'bond' An abrasive is an extremely hard material second in hardness only to diamond.
