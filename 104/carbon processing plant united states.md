## EPA Facility Level GHG Emissions Data
The GHGRP generally requires facilities that emit above 25,000 metric tons CO2e of GHGs to report their emissions. Therefore this data set does not reflect total U.S. emissions or total emissions from individual states. Roughly 50% of total U.S. emissions are reported by large emitting facilities subject to the GHGRP.

## INFOGRAPHIC: Carbon Capture 101 | Department of Energy
Put simply, carbon capture is the process of separating CO2 from the exhaust of a power plant so it can be permanently stored. There are two ways of doing this: pre-combustion and post-combustion. Pre-combustion captures the CO2 before the fossil fuel is burned, while post-combustion happens in the smokestack.

## Carbon Capture and Storage 101 - Resources for the Future
According to the Global CCS Institute's 2021 Status Report, plants in operation or under construction have the current capacity to capture 40 million metric tons of CO2 per year.(For context, the United States alone emitted over 5 billion metric tons of CO₂ in 2019). Globally, there are 31 commercial CCS facilities in operation or under construction.

## Fact Sheet: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)
Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a carbon removal technique that depends on two technologies. Biomass (organic material) is converted into heat, electricity, or liquid or gas fuels (the "bioenergy" step), and the carbon emissions from this bioenergy conversion are captured and stored in geological formations or embedded

## carbon processing plant united states
 United States: Average capacity factor for coal plants dropped in the United States from 73 percent in 2008 to 60% in 2013. Heat rate. A coal plant's heat rate is a measurement of how well a plant performs the task of converting one form of energy (coal) to another form of energy (electricity).
