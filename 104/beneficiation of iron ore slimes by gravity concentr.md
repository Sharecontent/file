Flotation of sulphide ore is more expensive than mag-netic separation of iron ore. Ore close to the surface is mined by open pit techniques, in which the waste rock can be separated by selective blasting and loading, and trucked to the waste dump instead of entering and diluting the ore flow into the concentra- tor.
