Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral. Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world.

Originally our idea in mining the Stewart was to set up basic operations, learn the gem mining trade, and then move up to the Queen which we were sure was more promising. However, with the discovery of the famed lost tourmaline adit and initial production of a few fine tourmaline crystals, we overstayed these original plans.

Hematite can also occur as a result of volcanic activity. Clay-sized hematite crystals occur as a secondary mineral along with oxyhydroxides, such as goethite, or other iron oxides as a result of the weathering process in soil. The most common deposits of hematite are sedimentary deposits, such as the Lake Superior district in North America.

## Re: How is Hematite mined? - MadSci
Typically, hematite is mined by open pit mining. Overburden is removed, then the ore is mined from an ever-deepening hole. The mineral and rock is first stripped by blasting the rock with explosives and removing it with enormous trucks - with capacities over 150 tons. The ratio of mineral to rock can be quite large - up to 1.5 to 1 for hematite.
