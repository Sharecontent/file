## Vertical and Horizontal Milling Machines: Key Points of Difference 
While horizontal milling machines are not as common as vertical machines, they are equally effective and harbor certain advantages such as - Speed: Horizontal machines yield high output and offer a quick turnaround time. They can cut faster than a vertical mill and can make more than one cut at a time without sacrificing precision.

## Horizontal vs Vertical Milling: What Are Their Differences - rapiddirect
However, there are some significant differences that affect the operations and results as well. Here are the main differences between vertical and horizontal milling. The Orientation of the Spindle. This is perhaps the biggest difference between the two setups. The orientation of the spindle dictates how the cutter interacts with the workpiece.
