## How a Coke Plant Works - GASP
How a Coke Plant Works. Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful by-products that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first.

Conveyor Belt Mistracking. This issue occurs when there is a conveyor belt tracking problem. Tracking is the process of managing and aligning the belt onto the correct path, and it's critical to ensuring the smooth functioning and output of your system. Mistracking, then, is when something goes wrong along this track.
