depend on each ironmaking furnace and thoserequirements influence the operation ofthe iron ore pelletizing plant. The idea of rolling moist fine ore in a drum to form balls and then drying and firing it was first patented by A. G. Andersson in Sweden in 1912. Further development was performed to bring the idea to reality.

## Iron ore | BHP
What is iron ore? Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted. There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red.
