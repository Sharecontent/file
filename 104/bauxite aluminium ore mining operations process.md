## Aluminium production process
At an aluminium smelter, alumina is poured into special reduction cells with molten cryolite at 950℃. Electric currents are then induced in the mixture at 400 kA or above; this current breaks the bond between the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in liquid aluminium settling at the bottom of the reduction cell.

The smelting of aluminum begins with the extraction of bauxite ore by a form of open cast mining. The bauxite is washed and screened before being converted to alumina, a white powdery element from which the aluminum is produced. Aluminum smelting is carried out in a Hall Heroult reduction cell, which is lined with carbon. A mix of alumina and cryolite is fed into the cell and carbon blocks

Bauxite is best defined as an aluminum ore of varying degrees of purity in which aluminum in the form of aluminum hydroxide or aluminum oxide is the largest single constituent. The impurities are largely iron oxide, silica, and titania. Bauxite varies greatly in physical appearance, depending on its composition and impurities.

About 90 percent of American-mined bauxite has come from deposits in central Arkansas. The Arkansas deposits were formed during the Eocene from weathering of intrusions of nepheline syenite, an aluminium-rich, silicate-poor, igneous rock. Bauxite is still mined in Arkansas, but has not been mined for aluminium metal production since 1981.

Bauxite is a high-aluminium-content rock. That is the main ore that aluminium is mined from. One of the most common elements on earth is bauxite. It contains almost 25 percent-30% alumina. In the belt around the equator, bauxite is commonly found. The primary aluminium bearing ore with an aluminium content of more than 35 to 40 percent is bauxite.
