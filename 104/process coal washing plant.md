Depending on its quality, coal needs to be "washed" with water and chemicals to remove sulfur and impurities before it can be burned in a power plant. Coal washing, or coal beneficiation, is widely seen as an efficient method for getting the most from run-of-mine coal. On the other hand, it is a water-intensive process: typically, washing
