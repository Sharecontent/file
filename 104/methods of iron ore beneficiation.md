## Diffesale Methods Of Iron Ore Beneficiation
Mar 10, 2021 the beneficiation method of this kind of ore is the most complex among all kinds of iron ores. generally, the combined process of weakly magnetic separation and other methods is adopted. that is, recovering magnetite by low-intensity magnetic separation, recovering weakly magnetic iron ore by gravity separation, flotation or strong

## Classification and beneficiation method of manganese ore
Beneficiation method of manganese bearing iron ore. The content of manganese in this kind of ore is low, only 5% - 10%. At the same time, it has the characteristics of fine disseminated particle size and close symbiosis of iron and manganese minerals, so it is difficult to recover by mechanical beneficiation.
