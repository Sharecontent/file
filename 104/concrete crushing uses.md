The desired concrete crushing failures shown in Figs. 1.24 and 1.25 can only be achieved if IC, CDC and PE debonding can be prevented from occurring before the design load to cause concrete crushing. However, this may not always be possible; in which case, it may be necessary to design for either IC or CDC debonding to occur at the design load so that concrete crushing will not occur.
