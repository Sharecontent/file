Concrete is made from cement sand gravel and water. In making concrete strong these ingredients should usually be mixed in a ratio of 1230.5 to achieve maximum strength. That is 1 part cement 2 parts sand 3 parts gravel and 0.5 part water. See figure 6. A part means a unit of measure. Technically it should be based on weight.
