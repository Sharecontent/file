Selective grinding refers to a kind of grinding phenomenon in which the ore fragmentation degrees is different in the grinding process due to the difference in hardness between minerals. The main purpose of the crushing and grinding operation is not to reduce the ore particle size, but to dissociate the useful minerals from the gangue minerals.

mineral processing crushing - jackhiggins. For mineral processing project, after blasting, crushing and screening system is always the first stage to reduce the big raw ore lumps to proper small particle size for following mill grinding system. Normally to reduce the big ore lumps to small particles, two to three stages crushing is required.
