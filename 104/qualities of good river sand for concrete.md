## Characteristics of Aggregates - Civil Snapshot
Aggregates for Concrete. Aggregates must conform to certain requirements and should consist of clean, hard, strong, and durable particles free of chemicals, coatings of clay, or other fine materials that may affect the hydration and bond of the cement paste. The characteristics of the aggregates influence the properties of the concrete.

Quality Counts. Make sure that your concrete producer purchases good-quality aggregate as verified by regular aggregate test results in compliance with ASTM C 33, "Standard Specifications for Concrete Aggregates." A history of good performance of a local aggregate also provides an indication of how well the material performs in service.

Concrete sand is a label that is typically used to describe the coarse washed sand that is a common ingredient in cement and asphalt mixtures. Its grains are larger than those of masonry sand, but a processing and screening process ensures that there are no large rocks or pebbles present. This material is often made of things like gneiss

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea.
