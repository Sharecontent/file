## Dust suppression solutions in the mining industry - Spray Nozzle
Mines use two types dust suppression solutions: atomisers and cone pattern nozzles. Air atomisers combine water droplets with compressed air to create different patterns of spray. Many atomisers allow the operator to adjust the air and water combinations to create different droplet sizes. Depending on the dust, you will need larger or smaller
