Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earthÂ´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut
