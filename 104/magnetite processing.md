Mar 31, 2022Processing. Sino Iron's processing plant is where we transform the magnetite ore into high quality, premium magnetite concentrate. This is the heart of our operation at Sino Iron. Before the ore arrives at the processing plant via the conveyor, it's already been reduced down at the in-pit crushers to roughly the size of house bricks.
