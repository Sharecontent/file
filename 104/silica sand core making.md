Hand-rammed core making. The third process involves manually ramming the cores, using a 75 AFS sand, from which the moulds are manufactured. This process is carried out on our foundry bench, which means that multiple core boxes can be rammed up at the same time. This is by far the quickest way to produce cores of different shapes and sizes but
