Iron ore is a common ore found almost everywhere in a Minecraft world. Iron ore generates around and below sea-level in the Overworld. It is a crucial material to gather during the early stages of the game since it can be made into a pickaxe, capable of mining all types of ores (including diamond ore). Every iron ore block contains enough iron to make one iron ingot when it is smelted. Iron

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.
