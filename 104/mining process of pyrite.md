Mining platinum in placer deposits is a relatively simple process. Dredges scoop the platinum-bearing sand or gravel from riverbeds or mining pits. The material is washed until platinum grains or nuggets are captured and pulled from the surrounding material. Sperrylite, or platinum arsenide. Photo from Thomas A. Loomis, Dakota Matrix Minerals.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

## Pyrite | Earth Sciences Museum | University of Waterloo
Pyrite seldom forms in fresh-water environments. The formation of pyrite crystals depends mainly on the iron content of the sediment. The process of pyrite formation in sediments results from the action of bacteria, which reduce sulphate ions (dissolved in the pore water) to sulphide. If there is iron present, iron sulphide crystals begin to grow.

Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.
