## Can a coal fired power station work? Explained by FAQ Blog
Unfortunately, the generation of electricity in a thermal power station is a very inefficient process and large amounts of energy are inevitably wasted in the form of heat energy.  This means that about 62% of the energy released by the burning of the coal or the nuclear reaction is wasted.

## Coal pollution mitigation
Coal pollution mitigation, sometimes called clean coal, is a series of systems and technologies that seek to mitigate the health and environmental impact of coal; in particular air pollution from coal-fired power stations, and from coal burnt by heavy industry.. The primary focus is on sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NO x), the most important gases which caused acid rain; and

## Can a coal fired power station work?f
Score: 4.5/5 (36 votes) . Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

Coal is delivered to the plant via road, rail or ship, and deposited in a coal yard.Stacker reclaimers are used to gather coal and deposit it into hoppers, the hoppers then feed flatbed conveyors.Conveyors transport the coal from the coal yard to day silos within the main power station building. Each day silo contains enough coal for a set period of time when the power station is fully loaded
