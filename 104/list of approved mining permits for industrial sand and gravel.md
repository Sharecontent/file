## Mining Approaches for Sand & Gravel - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.
