## What are the negative effects of mining? - AngMinero
Irresponsible mining practices can cause coal fires, which can burn for a long period of time. Without the appropriate technology and good practices, it can also release fly ash and smoke inhibited with greenhouse gases and other toxic chemicals. Mining greatly affects air quality, since it involves breaking through rocks to mine an ore.

## 33 Causes, Effects & Solutions for Mining - E&C
One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.

## Manganese Mining and Processing for Investors, Explained
Manganese is becoming one of the key building blocks for this modern industrial economy. When Manganese is added to steel it enhances the steel giving it a hard-yet-pliable quality, it helps depolarizing dry cell batteries and to decolorizing glass made green by iron impurities. It is also a powerful oxidizing agent.

There are many causes of mining pollution. Some of them include the following: 1. Technological advancement. Technological advancement has a serious role to play in mining pollution. Before the advent of technology, miners had to resort to conventional methods of extracting mined materials from the ore, and these methods had little to no effect
