## 15 Different Types of Milling Machines - Engineering Choice
Some of the main types of milling machines are as under: 1. Horizontal or Plain Milling Machine Plain milling machines are more robust than hand millers. The plain milling machines that have a horizontal spindle are also called horizontal milling machines. You can feed the table in vertical, cross, or horizontal directions.

## COMMON MILLING OPERATIONS | Winn Machine
A horizontal milling machine is best for forming flat surfaces, dovetails, keyways, and gears. These machines are best operated through and up milling process whereby the metal is fed into the cutter against its rotating direction. Compared to vertical milling, horizontal milling can exert maximum force against the jaw holding the workpiece.

## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

12. Gear Milling. This milling process is used to cut gears on the workpiece. The involute gear cutters are used in this operation. The gear cutting operation is performed in a milling machine by using a form-relieved cutter. The cutter may be a cylindrical type or end mill type. The cutter profile fits exactly with the tooth space of the gear.

This attachment is desirable on horizontal milling machines for substituting the horizontal spindle by a vertical spindle motion. The attachment is a right-angle gear box having bevel gear set in ratio of 1 : 1 and the axis of the vertical spindle could also be swivelled by 45Â°, thus allowing the machining of bevels and slanted surfaces.
