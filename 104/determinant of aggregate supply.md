## 6. Nonprice-level determinants of aggregate supply | Chegg
Question: 6. Nonprice-level determinants of aggregate supply The following graph shows an increase in aggregate supply (AS) in a hypothetical economy. Specifically, aggregate supply shifts to the right from AS1 to AS2, causing the quantity of output supplied at a price level of 125 to rise from $250 billion to $350 billion. 0 50 100 150 200 250

## A movement along the short-run aggregate supply curve in response to a 
B. The option is an incorrect answer choice since the answer would be the change in the aggregate quantity supplied rather than the revealed cost of aggregate supply C. Change in the aggregate supply happens due to the change in non-price factors and causes a shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve. As such, the option is incorrect.

## Determinants Of Supply | Definition | Economics - Geektonight
The major determinants of the supply of a product is its price. An increase in the price of a product increases its supply and vice versa while other factors remain the same. Producers increase the supply of the product at higher prices due to the expectation of receiving increased profits. Thus, price and supply have a direct relationship.

Definition: Determinants of supply are factors that may cause changes in or affect the supply of a product in the market place. What Does Determinants of Supply Mean? These factors include: 1. Production technology: an improvement of production technology increases the output.This lowers the average and marginal costs, since, with the same production factors, more output is produced.

They might also consider the costs of labor and other factors of production when making quantity decisions. Economists break down the determinants of a firm's supply into 4 categories: Price. Input Prices. Technology. Expectations. Supply is then a function of these 4 categories. Let's look more closely at each of the determinants of supply.

Input prices: The price of inputs has a negative effect on the supply curve, if the price of inputs goes up, supply will decrease (shift left). Imagine you are running a taco shop, and the price of corn goes up. Since it now costs more to supply tacos, you are going to have to charge more for your tacos, or shift your supply curve left (Sl).
