Dec 10, 2021Bitcoin rig makers Innosilicon and KNC Miners say they will soon ship their own Litecoin rigs. Los Angeles, California, a company called Hash Master has sold about 10,000 rigs on top of GridSeed chips in the past two months and is ready to develop new systems based on a new generation of custom chips, said Aron Peleo, the company's owner.

Later we bought some ASICs and mined a bit of Litecoin. But, for the most part, we were GPU mining. Why build a Monero mining rig? There's a few reason we want to build a Monero mining rig. And, before we go any further, it may reach break even as fast as a video card based mining rig, but even at that point it won't be making a ton of money.

The required power can be calculated based on the power consumption of video cards. Never be stingy in this matter, buying a power supply "back to back". You should have 10-20% of the power consumption in stock. That is, if in total your farm consumes 950 watts, then it is better to buy 1100 watt power supply.

Bitcoin miners get rewarded for the work they do in BTC. The amount they get is called "block rewards", and it is the same for every cluster of transactions - in 2009, that was 50 BTC. These rewards get cut in half every 4 years. Currently, it's 6.25 BTC. This process is called a - you guessed it - Bitcoin halving.

The easiest way to mine Litecoin is to download software that utilizes the hardware (CPU and/or GPU) within your computer. And because the hashrate often follows the cryptocurrency's price, the higher the price means more miners will be managing the blockchain. Litecoin mining process will vary depending on what hardware and software you are using.

For example, one featured Bitcoin mining rig costs USD $1,767 to build and operate and generates $4.56 in profit per day at current prices. Thus, it would need to run for 387 days to become profitable. Factored into this number are electricity costs. Also, however, is the fact that even after breaking even the rigs will consume electricity.

Here's a useful video, posted Nov. 18, 2017, of BitcoinHog interviewing a miner who built an $80,000 mining rig that generates $6,000 to $8,000 per month mining ZCash. The mining operation includes 10 rigs with seven cards each, a total of 70 GPUs. The owner of the mining operation says he and his partner ran into several challenges, but perhaps the biggest challenge was dealing with heat.
