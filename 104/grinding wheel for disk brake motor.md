## Why My Brakes Grinding After Replacing Pads And Rotors?
There are two sorts of brake systems: disc and drum. Both use friction and resistance to prevent the vehicle. In a disc-style system, there's a rotor connected to the wheel. Calipers powered by the vehicle's hydraulic brake system apply pressure to the brake pad, which rubs against the rotor, causing friction, bringing the revolution to a stop.

## Symptoms of a Bad or Failing Brake Rotor/Disc - YourMechanic
1. Noisy Brakes. One of the first symptoms commonly associated with bad brake rotors is noise. If the rotors are warped (meaning not perfectly flat) or severely worn, they may produce squealing or squeaking sounds. Usually, warped rotors will produce a squeak, while severely worn rotors will produce a scraping sound.

Also, a broken shim or worn-out shim can cause grinding noise when braking sometimes because it makes contact with a piece of the braking system.

## Grinding Brake Drums on a Brake Lathe - Practical Machinist
Disk brake rotors typically didn't get hard spots. Today, auto brake drums are so cheap that it's not worth it to grind them. Truck drums and flywheels would still be a good application for grinding. The grinding wheel had to be dressed before grinding, so a diamond dressing tool was attached to the drum or flywheel for this purpose.

Another factor that affects the choice of wheel bond is the wheel speed in operation. Usually vitrified wheels are used at speeds less than 6,500 surface feet per minute. At higher speeds, the vitrified bond may break. Organic bond wheels are generally the choice between 6,500 and 9,500 surface feet per minute.

Typically it will take driving the car a few hundred miles under normal braking conditions (city driving) for the new brake pads to get worn in.

If your Tiguan's rotors are warped they can make a grinding noise. Broken Shims - A shim that has worn out can make contact with the brake hardware and cause the grinding noise. Shims are one of the more overlooked items when doing a brake job. Lack of Lubrication - Brake caliper bolts help the caliper adjust as the brake pads wear down.
