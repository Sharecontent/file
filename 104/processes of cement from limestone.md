## How to Process Limestone? - Blog - HongXing Machinery
Limestone is not only an indispensable raw material for the cement and steel industry but also widely used in water ash, smelting, cement, chemical, power plant desulfurization, and paper industries. In addition, the limestone can be used as a substitute for plastics to make packaging materials, which brings environmentally-friendly benefits.

## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.

While the process of making cement uses a number of tools, the production of concrete requires only a concrete mixer. In the first stage of making cement, limestone and clay are crushed together to form a powder. This powder is then combined in a mixer before passing into a rotating heater which has constant heat applied at one end of the tube.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

Flux Stone: Crushed limestone is used in smelting and other metal refining processes. In the heat of smelting, limestone combines with impurities and can be removed from the process as slag. Portland Cement: Limestone is heated in a kiln with shale, sand, and other materials and ground to a powder that will harden after being mixed with water.

The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

As a source of calcium, it joins with powdered clay to produce a product called clinker, which is then ground with a source of sulfate, like gypsum. It is mixed with water, sand and crushed rock to create concrete.

## Portland-Limestone Cement - National Precast Concrete Association
ASTM C595 and AASHTO M240 were revised in 2012 to define portland-limestone cements with between 5% and 15% limestone by mass. Portland-limestone cement (PLC) has comparable performance properties to ordinary portland cement but improves the environmental performance of concrete. PLC has been used in the United States on a limited scale in
