## manganese ore separation
The ore enrichment process is designed to increase its manganese content to just over 50% through magnetic separation. Part of the enriched ore is directly sold, while another part goes through a pelletizing process in which the mineral is mixed with coke and exposed to high temperatures, which increases its manganese content to around 56%.

manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
