## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Present day placer mining uses pans, water and gravity, just like the prospector of 1849, only on a larger scale. This "modern" placer technology only recovers up to 40% of the gold from every ton of ore concentrate (finely ground ore) as it primarily targets nuggets and flakes of gold. The remaining 60% goes untouched.

The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

## Ore sorting: the road to optimizing your operation
Sensor-based ore particle sorting can be used to pre-concentrate ROM ore feed, SAG Mill scats and low grade or waste stockpiles. Plant throughput increase, reduced operating costs and mine optimization should be considered in evaluating sorting as well as increased recovery in flotation and leach circuits. The economic benefit to the operation
