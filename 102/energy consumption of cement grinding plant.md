## Energy Saving In Grinding Circuit In Cement Plant
In general, grinding consumes around 30 - 40% of the electrical energy used in the cement production of an integrated cement plant. The power consumption of a high grade slag cement, ground in a modern ball mill with closed circuit, is in the range of 50 - 70 kWh/t. energy. But if the cement manufactures goal is to dispose of the

## Breaking down energy consumption in industrial grinding mills
The energy used in grinding and regrinding was calculated using the bond work index formula and compared with the energy consumed when the total mass of sample was ground fine (d80 = 150 μm) and
