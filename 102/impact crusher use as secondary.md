Sep 2, 20211.1 Impact crushers can be divided into two types according to the number of rotors: single-rotor and double-rotor impact crushers. 1.2 The structure of the single rotor impact crusher (Figure 1) is relatively simple and consists mainly of the rotor 5 (strike plate 4), the impact plate 7 and the machine body. The rotor is fixed to the main shaft.

## Impact Crushers - Powerscreen
Impact crushers (also known as impactors or horizontal shaft impactors) can be used in primary, secondary, or tertiary applications. They use inertia of the blowbars fitted to the rotor to fracture the material, resulting in a high reduction ratio. Impactors are often used as a cost effective alternative to jaw and cone combination plants as

The common secondary crushers are cone, roll, and impact types. The cone crusher (Fig. 13.12) is very similar to the gyratory type, except that it has a much shorter spindle with a larger-diameter crushing surface relative to its vertical dimension. The spindle is not suspended as in the gyratory crusher.
