## Mercury - PAHO/WHO | Pan American Health Organization
Mercury is toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury exists in various forms: elemental (or metallic); inorganic (e.g. mercuric chloride); and organic (e.g., methyl- and ethylmercury), which all have different toxic effects, including on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes.

First, mercury is mixed with the materials containing gold. A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not.

According to Roskelley 16 ozs. of mercury and 6 ozs. of gold amalgam are enough for setting a plate 16 feet by 4 feet 9 inches. A more usual method of preparing the plates in California is to coat them with electro-deposited silver. This plating is done by certain establishments in California for most of the mills, but it can be done on the

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.
