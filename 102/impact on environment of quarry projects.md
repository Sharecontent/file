##  Environmental Impact Assessment on Quarry
Quarrying is a short-term activity with long term effects it comes along with the promises of wealth and jobs but it brings high environmental costs. The main aim of the study was to unearth impacts that quarrying activities has on health of the quarry workers and people living next to the quarries as well as physical environment.

One of the biggest negative impacts of quarrying on the environment is the damage to biodiversity. Biodiversity conservation is important as all species are interlinked and our survival depends on the fine balance that exists within nature [9]. Quarry activity has the potential to destroying habitats and species Mabogunje [10].

Quarrying is necessary to provide much of the materials used in traditional hard flooring, such as granite, limestone, marble, sandstone, slate and even just clay to make ceramic tiles. However, like many other man-made activities, quarrying causes a significant impact on the environment.
