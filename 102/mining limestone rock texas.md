## CDC - Mining - How Does Limestone Rock Dust Prevent Coal Dust 
Coal dust explosions in underground coal mines are prevented by generous application of rock dust (usually limestone). If an explosion should occur, the rock dust disperses, mixes with the coal dust and prevents flame propagation by acting as a thermal inhibitor or heat sink. To investigate this process in more detail, a number of explosion
