## aluminum processing - Ores | Britannica
Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

## Extraction of Aluminium (Aluminium Ore) - Hall-Heroults Process & Uses 
The Hall-Heroult process is widely used in the extraction of aluminium. In Hall-Heroults process, pure Al 2 O 3 is mixed with CaF 2 or Na 3 AlF 6. This results in lowering the melting point of the mixture and increases its ability to conduct electricity. A steel vessel with a lining of carbon and graphite rods is used.

The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

## Occurrence and Extraction of Aluminium: Hall Heroult  - Collegedunia
A mineral from which metal can be extracted easily and in an economic manner is its ore. Aluminium has varied properties and the ore extraction of aluminum is a comparatively cost-effective process. Following are the different ores of aluminium: Bauxite (Al 2 O 3.2H 2 O) is the chief ore from which Aluminium is extracted. Almost 98 per cent of

## Extraction process of Aluminium from it's Ore (bauxite) - Blogger
Firstly, aluminium has to be removed from the Earth, by mining. This is relatively simple, given the abundance of Aluminium. However, Aluminium is always bounded to other elements, and exists as compounds, often containing oxygen and silicon. Thus, it is impossible to obtain a pure substance of aluminium through mining. Aluminium's ore is bauxite.
