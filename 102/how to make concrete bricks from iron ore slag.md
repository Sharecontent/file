Extraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and Reactions. A Blast furnace is a gigantic, steel stack lined with refractory brick where the concentrated iron ore, coke, and limestone are dumped from the top, and a blast of hot air is blown into the bottom All the three ingredients are crushed into small round pieces and mixed and put on a hopper which controls the input

## How to Make Bricks In 8 Simple Steps - Em OffGrid
Concrete Brick Concrete brick is one of the least commonly used bricks. It is of poor strength concrete and of inferior quality. Such bricks are used above and below the damp proof layer. Such bricks may be used for façade, fencing, and internal brickwork because of their sound reduction and heat resistance capabilities.

## Characteristics of bricks made from waste steel slag
Steel slag is a by-product produced during the conversion of iron ore or scrap iron to steel. The mineralogical composition of steel slag changes with its chemical composition.  In order to investigate the feasibility of slag reuse in brick making, the slag content in the clay-slag mixture varied from 5% to 10%, 20% or 30% by weight

## How iron is made - Forestry and Land Scotland
The ingredients to make useable iron were limestone, ironstone, coke and air. The coke is the fuel and the ironstone provides the iron ore. Ironstone is first roasted in calcining kilns, located next to the blast furnaces, to remove impurities. The air, or blast, was blown into the blast furnace by powerful steam engines.

## slag in concrete Topic - American Concrete Institute
The use of slag in concrete has several benefits, including reduced energy, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced use of raw materials. Various types of slag are produced: - Blast-furnace slag—The nonmetallic product, consisting essentially of silicates and aluminosilicates of calcium and of other bases, that is developed in a molten condition simultaneously with iron in a blast furnace.

The basic formula to make concrete is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand and 3 parts aggregate by volume. Finally add water as needed. The stone should be between a 1/2 inch to an inch with rounded sides. Don't use aggregate that's jagged or too large because it makes the concrete hard to form.

Early material production processes were relatively simple, requiring only harvesting, as for stone and timber, and mixing and heating as for bricks and concrete. These materials are still in use today and are generally produced much more efficiently than in early days, with energy intensities of the order of 1-5 MJ kg −1. Newer materials
