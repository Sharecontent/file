## Minerals for sheep and goatsyulla
Jul 28, 2020 · Sheep need salt to remain thrifty, make economical gains, lactate, and reproduce. Mature sheep will consume ~0.02 lb. (9 g) of salt daily, and lambs half this amount. Range operators commonly provide 0.5-0.75 lb. ( g) of salt/ewe/mo. Salt as 0.2%-0.5% of the dietary dry matter is usually adequate.

## Clean process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate 
A new process for the production of defluorinated dicalcium phosphate using phosphate rock was developed. This new process has the main characteristic of being clean, without the production of any liquid waste. The process has essentially three main steps: phosphate rock digestion, defluorination and neutralization.
