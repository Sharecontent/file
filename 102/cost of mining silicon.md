Feb 11, 2022However, increases in silicon production costs will likely continue to exceed more broad-based measures of inflation beyond mid-decade. The rise in costs will be compounded by a gradual weakening of the US dollar. As a result, silicon prices are projected to stay substantially higher than they were in the years prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.

## The Costs of Mining | The Breakthrough Institute
The mine will be 40 miles from the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribes (FMPST) reservation and is the largest lithium resource in the US. Lithium Americas, the company in charge of the project, is leaching lithium from the clay deposits with sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid attacks the ore, separating the lithium which dissolves into the acid.
