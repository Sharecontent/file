## Mining | National Geographic Society
Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.

## Analysis of Copper-Gold Ore
Analysis of Copper-Gold Ore. Mining plants require various samples of the metals extracted from ore to be routinely analyzed, including the feed (crushed ore), the tails (waste ore left over after processing) and the concentrate (the final product). Metals requiring analysis at a copper-gold mine do not just include copper (Cu) and gold (Au).

## Cascabel Copper-Gold Project, Cascabel region, Ecuador - Mining Technology
The Cascabel copper-gold project is located in the north-western part of Ecuador near the Andean Copper Belt. The main target of the Cascabel project is the Alpala deposit. The site is under-explored and is just 60km away from the Cu Llurimaga copper project, which has inferred resources of 982 million tonnes (Mt).
