Kennecott-type deposits, among the highest grade copper deposits in the world, are located in the Wrangell Mountains of Alaska. They are strata bound within the lowermost 100 m of the Upper Triassic Chitistone Limestone, which overlies the Triassic Nikolai Greenstone, a sequence of largely subaerial basalt flows more than 1,800 m thick.

Copper Ore $30 This ore is quite common. Copper nodes can be mined 3 times before exhaustion. Tier 1 Zinc Ore $40  Limestone $60 Held in large amounts, this ore can only be found in The Quarry and in the river valley between The Great Plains and Pinewood Hills. Limestone chunks can be mined twice before exhaustion, at which point they disappear.

Iron-ore mining in El Tofo and El Romeral, both in north-central Chile, is significant, and manganese, silver and gold, and molybdenum (a metal derived from the large copper deposits) are also mined. Among nonmetallic minerals, sulfur, gypsum, lithium, and limestone are moderately exploited.
