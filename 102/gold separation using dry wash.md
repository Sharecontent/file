## Dry Washing for Gold - Gold Rush Nuggets
Dry washers are devices that are used to separate gold from lighter material without the use of water. They do this by using a regulated air flow, which blows off lighter material and allows the gold to settle. It was actually invented by Thomas Edison in 1897, and the new tool provided miners with an invaluable way to prospect in the desert.

Step #1: Crush and Screen the Sand. Most of the alluvial gold contain cemented mud, which is attached to the gravel or pebbles. If it is not broken in advance, it will cause gold loss during the screening process. Moreover, because of their different particle sizes, if the particle size is larger than 100 mm, they will be discharged along with

A drywasher is a common desert mining tool for gold mining.. A drywasher is like a highbanker, [clarification needed] since it uses a motor and a form of sluice, but it has no need for water.It drywasher operates by the use of air. By forcing air to flow up through the material as it moves down the sluice, the heavier materials, like gold, will stay at the bottom and get trapped by the riffles
