## Iron Deficiency Anemia - Merck Manuals Consumer Version
Iron deficiency anemia usually develops slowly because it may take several months for the body's iron reserves to be used up. As the iron reserves are decreasing, the bone marrow gradually produces fewer red blood cells. When the reserves are depleted, the red blood cells are not only fewer in number but also abnormally small.
