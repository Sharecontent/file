This process is suitable for low grade phosphate ores including magmatite type apatite and sedimentary metamorphic type phosphorite ore. 2.Reverse Flotation Process. Mainly used for the separation of phosphate and dolomite; dolomite is collected with fatty acid collector in weak alkaline medium, and the phosphorus mineral is enriched in the groove.

The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.

Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

## Phosphate Rock Mining - JXSC Mining
The term phosphate rock (or phosphorite) is used to denote any rock with high phosphorus content. The largest and least expensive source of phosphorus is obtained by mining and concentrating phosphate rock from the numerous phosphate deposits of the world. Some phosphate rock is used to make calcium phosphate nutritional supplements for animals.
