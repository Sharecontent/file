## ZIMBABWE'S GOLD POTENTIAL
Feb 14, 2008. Zimbabwe is perhaps the only country whose colonisation by Europeans was a direct result of its perceived rich and wide variety of gold deposits. The Portuguese occupied parts of the country in the 17th century and traded in gold with local miners. Following the accounts of the Portuguese, and information gathered by 19th century

## Small-scale gold miners upstage big producers - Zimbabwe Situation
Small scale gold miners managed ― for the first time in more than 10 years ― to deliver more gold than large-scale mining houses last year, recovering from a three-tonne nadir recorded at the height of Zimbabwe's economic crisis in 2008. However, this was still short of the 27-tonne peak reached in 1999.

## "We are one big happy family": The social  - ScienceDirect
In Zimbabwe, artisanal and small scale mining (ASM) for gold is undertaken through the exploitation of reefs and alluvial placer deposits. It is estimated that as many as two million people across the country derive their livelihoods from ASM (Mawowa, 2013; Spiegel, 2017; Chipangura, 2019). Despite the huge role of ASM, relatively little has

This article examines the policy framework in place for small-scale gold mining in Zimbabwe. Through an analysis of stakeholder interviews and industry performance, the paper argues that the main government initiatives to manage gold mining in recent years have proved counterproductive, as economic returns from minerals have hemorrhaged due to increased illegal activity.

## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Abstract. Background: In 2017 around 14-19 million miners were exposed to multiple hazards in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). ASGM is characterized by basic and compromised mining methods with either very limited control of hazards or none at all. There is little knowledge about health and safety among artisanal and small-scale gold miners in Zimbabwe.
