## Coal Mining in India - ClearIAS
Coal demand in the country is yet to peak as the Economic Survey projects coal demand in the range of 1.3-1.5 billion tonnes by 2030, an increase of 63 percent from the current demand. Thus, as of now, there is no scenario of energy transition away from coal affecting any stakeholders involved in coal mining.

## Coal in a Nutshell - ThoughtCo
Therefore, geologists have long assumed that coal is a form of peat created by the heat and pressure of deep burial. The geologic process of turning peat into coal is called "coalification." Coal beds are much, much larger than peat bogs, some of the tens of meters in thickness, and they occur all over the world.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Feb 15, 2022Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

Jul 29, 2022Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.
