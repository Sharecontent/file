## Coke (fuel)
Coke is a grey, hard, and porous coal-based fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities, made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air—a destructive distillation process. It is an important industrial product, used mainly in iron ore smelting, but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.. The unqualified term "coke" usually refers to the product derived

"Beneficiation will be key: we can make catalytic converters and jewellery, and we can do it all here" he said. Toyota, which manufactures in South Africa, is an obvious potential customer for Ivanplats' catalytic converters. It may be no disadvantage that Ivanplats minority shareholder, with 18%, is Itochu - a Japanese company.

Gulhan Ozbayoglu, in Comprehensive Energy Systems, 2018. 3.19.1.1.2 Coal is used in iron and steel industry. Coking coal is an essential input for production of iron and steel. The largest single use of coal in the steel industry is as a fuel for the blast furnace and for the production of metallurgical coke for reduction of iron ore or for injection with the hot blast.

## Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Swapan Kumar Haldar, in Mineral Exploration (Second Edition), 2018. 13.2.4.3 In-Stream Analyzer and Process Control. Mineral beneficiation, particularly base and noble metals, is sensitive to optimum use of reagents, recovery of metals, and clean concentrate.High fluctuation of feed grade at flotation cells yields loss of metals to tailing. The offline analytical procedures discussed at

## Coke Coal Hydraulic Beneficiation Process
Dry Beneficiation Of Coal Sciencedirect. Processes, such as the, direct reduction process, to eliminate the need to manufacture coke. • Use beneficiation (preferably at the coal mine) and blending processes which improve the quality of coal feed to produce coke of desired quality and reduce emissions of sulfur oxides and other pollutants.
