## Concentration of Ore - Biology Reader
The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.

## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Concentration refers to the methods of producing ore fractions richer in iron and lower in silica than the original material. Most processes rely on density differences to separate light minerals from heavier ones, so the ore is crushed and ground to release the ore minerals from the gangue.
