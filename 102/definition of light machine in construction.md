## Your definition of "light" construction? - Fine Homebuilding
Light construction differs from regular construction only in that there are little perforations around the plenum before the HVAC system, allowing in more "fresh" air along with the flavorful air. This is of course a mere ruse by the evil construction companies, as during normal installation the perforated plenum is inserted past the lips of

Whatever, when you ride the cycle, it will have speed. In the same way, light is also having a speed. However, this speed is fixed, and we can calculate also. Speed means distance travel in 1 sec or 1 hour. In the below picture, light travels 150,000,000 km in 500 sec. So, we can say, in 500 sec light travel 150,000,000 km.
