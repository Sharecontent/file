## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

## Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Crushing is accomplished by compression of the ore against a rigid surface or by impact against a surface in a rigidly constrained motion path. Crushing is usually a dry process and carried out on ROM ore in succession of two or three stages, namely, by (1) primary, (2) secondary, and (3) tertiary crushers.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.
