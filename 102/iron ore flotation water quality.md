(1) Soft water Most rivers and lakes are soft water and are the most used in flotation. It is characterized by relatively low salinity, generally less than 0.1% salt, polyvalent metal ions is low. The hardness of water is usually measured by the amount of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ ions in water. The total hardness of water can be converted as follows:

Fatty acids are widely used as a collector in the reverse anionic flotation of iron ores. The most popular anionic collectors used in iron ore flotation practice are oleic acid and its soaps [16,26]. The oleate in aqueous solution forms different species and which species dominate is dependent on pH.

For example, at Republic Mine, Michigan, U.S.A., a hematite ore is upgraded from 36.5% Fe to 65.4% Fe with a Fe recovery of 82.5% using the direct flotation route

##  Chapter-9 Froth Flotation and Its Application to Concentration  - Core
The flotation method of concentration, used extensively for other metal ores, has only recently been utilized for hematite iron ores. It can be applied as either the sole concentration process or as a final concentration stage to ensure a high-grade product. In the flotation process, air is bubbled through a suspension of fine iron ore in water

## Steel manufacturing process pptht.shop
Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

## Adjustment of Flotation Slurry: Water Quality - JXSC Machine
Jan 6, 2022Contact Now +. Published time：06 January 2022. The adjustment of flotation pulp includes pulp depth, PH value, and so on. The temperature and water quality of the flotation slurry have obvious effects on the separation. Before the ore pulp enters the flotation machine, if it is reasonably adjusted, the flotation machine can

## The effect of water quality on flotation - Froth Flotation (Sulphide 
The effect of water quality on flotation is a common issue when designing and when operating concentrators. Liu et al. (2013) reviewed existing studies on water quality variation in flotation and developed a framework and analysis around three aspects: causes of water quality variation, conseque
