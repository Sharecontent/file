## Elk Valley Coal Mines Selenium Pollution in BC, Canada
While coal mining in the region has been taking place since the 1800s, only the last 40 years have seen the advent of intensive open pit mining [2]. Teck Resources is the world's 2nd largest exporter of steel-making coal and their Elk Valley mines have a shared capacity of over 21,7 Million tons of coal [1, 2].

Abandoned Mine Education. In September of 2007, an all night search ended tragically Sunday morning near Chloride, a small town in northwest Arizona, after two girls, one 13-year-old and one 10-year-old, fell into an abandoned mine shaft. The girls were riding an ATV early Saturday evening when they plunged into the 125-foot-deep mine shaft.

## Reading: Open-Pit Mining | Geology | | Course Hero
Open-pit mining, or open-cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth, such as long wall mining. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the surface; that is, where

Open-Pit vs. Strip Mining. Strip mining is a surface technique where workers clear vegetation, waste rock, and overburden from the ground. Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface. Open-pit mining differs as workers excavate large landscapes on deeper slopes, separated by "benches."
