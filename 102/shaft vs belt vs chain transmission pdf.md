## Difference Between Gear Drive and Belt Drive
Moreover, it is always kept under full lubrication. Thus gear drive provides high efficiency, usually above 99%. On the other hand, belt drive is one friction drive and has surface contact between pulley and belt (lower pair). Loss of power due to friction results lower efficiency in belt drive (around 92 - 96%).

They just keep on working. Belt drives last longer than chain drives- A properly maintained belt drive can last 3-5 times as long as a chain drive. Some riders have gotten 20,000 miles (around 30,000 km) out of a single belt. Most chains only last miles. Cleaner- Belt drives require no lubrication.

V-belts allow slippage which can be desirable and intended in drive design. For example, in a mower deck where the belt must slip rather than break the belt or bend a shaft when the blade contacts a rock or a stump. Synchronous or timing belt is a positive engagement device. It is a highly efficient system of power transmission.

## Design of Transmission Systems - Belts - Google
Belts. Belt drives are commonly used in transmission of power between two shafts which are at some distance. The belts run over pulleys, the pulley connected with the source of power is called the driver pulley and the other pulley is a called a driven. Sometimes belt drives may have idler pulleys also. The belts may have different cross

A chain drive is driven by a chain loop while a belt drive is driven by a belt. A chain drive is made of a metal which makes them more durable and stronger as compared to belt while belt drive is made of synthetic material. A chain can transmit more power and last longer, but typically a belt is quieter. A belt drive gives you lower power

My personal opinion: Chain drive gets the power from the engine to the rear wheel more efficiently and is lighter weight than a shaft-drive system.
