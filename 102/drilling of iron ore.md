## the process of drilling iron ore
The molten iron and slag are removed, or cast, from the furnace periodically. The casting process begins with drilling a hole, called the taphole, into the clay-filled iron notch at the base of the hearth. During casting, molten iron flows into runners that lead to transport ladles. Slag also flows.

The Iron Age began around 1200 BC, ending the Bronze Age that preceded it and paving the way to man's mastery of metal. Individuals during this period began extracting iron ore to forge tools and weapons. The reason revolves around Iron being one of the most abundant metals found on earth.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Mining iron ore typically involves finding a fertile site, drilling and blasting the ore, and then transporting it to the primary crusher for processing. Crushed ore is sorted over screens and resized to different specifications (lump and refined products). After the processing, a stacker builds a stockpile in the stockyards.

## Environmental impact of iron ore mining
Common methods of extracting the iron ore consist of blasting, drilling, or general excavating, Most iron ore is produced from open-pit mines. Blasting in iron ore is done by putting explosives materials which are drilled into holes and fired to break and loosen intact rock, so that ore and other material can be excavated and delivered to the

## Environmental impact of iron ore mining
Introduction Iron ore. Iron ore is rock containing enough iron content, and in sufficient volume and accessibility to mining and transportation to be able to be economically mined. Iron in ore iron is most commonly found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite (FeO(OH)), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O)) or siderite (FeCO 3). Hematite and magnetite are the most common

## Diamond Core Drilling: Theory, Mechanisms and Applications
Before the introduction of mainstream diamond drilling, mining was still primarily dependent on finding outcrops of rock, with little information available about ore concentrations below the surface. Diamond drilling allows for the removal of solid cylinders of rock (core) from deep within the earth.
