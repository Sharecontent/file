## Below the surface: Setting up an underground primary jaw crusher
Jaw crushers are the most common solution in underground applications when the throughput is below 1000 tonnes per hour, depending somewhat on the scalping solutions. Above 1000 tph, primary gyratory crushers are an option. After the throughput reaches 2000 tph, jaw crushers are very rare, with the exception of a parallel plant layout.
