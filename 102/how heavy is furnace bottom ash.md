Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) FBA is typically grey to black in colour, is quite angular and has a porous surface structure. The characteristics of the FBA are influenced by the type of furnace in which the coal is burned, the rank of the coal, actual operating conditions in the furnace and how the FBA is removed from the boiler station (wet or dry transport).

Bottom ash is part of the non-combustible residue of combustion in a furnace or incinerator.In an industrial context, it usually refers to coal combustion and comprises traces of combustibles embedded in forming clinkers and sticking to hot side walls of a coal-burning furnace during its operation. The portion of the ash that escapes up the chimney or stack is, however, referred to as fly ash.

Broadly coal ash consists of (i) fly ash, (ii) bottom ash, (iii) boiler slag, and (iv) flue gas desulphurization waste (Fig 1). The ash collected from pulverized-coal-fired furnaces is fly ash and bottom ash. For such furnaces, fly ash constitutes a major component (80 % to 90 %) and the bottom ash component is in the range of 10 % to 20 %.

When pulverized coal is burned in a bottom boiler, most of the unburned material is caught in the flue gas and captured as fly ash.Only about 10-20% of this ash is bottom ash. This ash is dark grey in colour, and is about the size of sand. This ash is collected in a water-filled hopper at the bottom of the furnace and removed by high-pressure water jets.

Bottom ash is the residue that is fused into heavy particles that drop out of the furnace gas stream (air and combustion gases). Table 10.3 presents the chemical composition properties of bottom ash. These particles are formed at the bottom of the furnace. Bottom ash consists of coarser and heavier particles than fly ash (Torrey, 1978).The color of bottom ash ranges from gray to black.

Clinker formation is a serious problem in boilers of thermal power plants which results in forced outage and generation loss. Removal of clinkers from the water wall is difficult thus requires pneumatic hammering. Low quality coal having less gross calorific value, high mineral content, high ash content, and the over-firing of molten slag are causes of clinker formation. Power engineers must

The bottom ash is heavy and stays in the furnace until it is scraped out. Due to potential liability issues andor the need to find new real estate at power plants for expansion many utilities must replace their traditional coal ash ponds. Utilities using traditional hydro bins can accomplish this by installing a system using solids contact.
