## 33 Causes, Effects & Solutions for Mining - E&C
One cause of mining is population growth. With an increasing population, the overall world consumption levels also increase. This means that in order to be able to provide enough goods for the world population, resources have to be extracted at large scale. One great possibility to extract these resources is mining.
