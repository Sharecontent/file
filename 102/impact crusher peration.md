When the impact crusher is in operation, the motor drives the rotor to rotate at high speed and the material enters and falls onto the rotor, which strikes the material at high speed and the liner in the crushing chamber is crushed again. The material produced by the impact crusher has fine particles and is nearly cubic in shape.

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
