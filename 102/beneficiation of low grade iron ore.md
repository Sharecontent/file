## India's beneficiation of low-grade iron ore could result in new trade 
Aug 19, 2022An iron ore industry source in Singapore has doubts about India being a sustainable long-term supplier of high-grade iron ore. "There are costs involved in this. For example, new capital expenditure to set up beneficiation and concentration plants, so it's not likely that every miner will be able to do it," he said.

## Iron Ore Industry - Beneficiation Technology
Lower grade deposits have significant silica content and this restricts the saleability of the beneficiated iron ore product. DEC Flotation columns have been used and produced very good results in reducing the silica content. Typically, silica can be reduced from 5-7.5% to 2-3% while the iron ore grade is increased from 58-61.5% to 64-65.5%

Beneficiation is the process where ore is reduced in size and gange separated from the ore. Since all iron ore deposits have unique mineralogy, the beneficiation process is specific to each deposit.  the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product (ore concentrate) and a waste stream

Nearly 17 per cent of total iron ore produced in India is of low grade. In India, steel mills are known to use premium iron-ore grade of 62 per cent and above; while ores of lower grade, i.e. FE content 58 and below, are preferred for exports. The committee has recommended penalty for failure to adhere to the mandate too.
