Wisconsin well code has prohibited placing wells in basements since 1953. Basement wells are subject to flooding, sewage backup and other sanitary hazards. Outside wells, terminating above ground level, are generally safe from these hazards. A pitless adaptor provides a freeze-proof connection between an outside well and the basement of a building.

Very few jet pumps are more than 80% efficient. .80 X 31 feet = 24.8 feet at sea level. If the well is 25 feet deep + another 4 feet vert. = 29 feet, as the water pulls down the pump will pump less and less water, until the impeller starts to cavitate. When it cavitates it creates air and can loose its prime.

Here is a tip. You have to screw several pipes together to get down 20-30', When you get the point all the way down. Insert a length of inexpensive plastic pipe down inside the pipe to the point. This eliminates leaks and corrosion. Then you must have a check valve on your pump and hook right to the plastic pipe.

If any portion of the well screen is in water bearing sand, water will be able to get into the well casing to be pumped out. On the right is a setup that improves on the well screen. A gravel pack around the well screen provides the advantages of both a well pack and a well screen and will typically result in a very productive well.

It isn't small round stones you concern yourself with, it's the fine stuff that fits the openings in the fine screen. Water is pushed into the point and pumped out of the point.

## 5. Lake of the Woods. You may not find a more scenic
