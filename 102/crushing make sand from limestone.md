Jul 08, 2019· Sand melts into a liquid state at around 1700˚ C (or 30390˚ F)! In a commercial glass plant, sand is mixed with cullet (recycled glass pieces), soda ash and limestone and is then heated. The soda helps reduce the sand's melting point which helps reduce the overall energy—and cost—needed to melt it.

Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.

## Limestone
Limestone is a common type of carbonate sedimentary rock which is the main source of the material lime.It is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3).Limestone forms when these minerals precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. This can take place through both biological and nonbiological processes

6. Crushed Stone Sand. Crushed stone sand is widely tipped as the natural successor of river sand. This type of sand usually contains no impurities, which makes it ideal for use in concrete. Crushed stone sand is a type of M-sand as it undergoes a thorough crushing process and testing before being released for construction work.

When comparing stone dust vs sand, this sand is definitely an acceptable material to use under pavers. It provides drainage, wont eat away at the pavers, and it compacts well. With the compaction of the pavers, the sand will work its way into the joints of the pavers from below creating that interlock that is required in an interlocking system.
