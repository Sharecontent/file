In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata. Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface, and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities for such essential activities as human and

## A Basic Introduction to Underground Mining
August 26, 2021. Underground mining usually involves the digging of subversive tunnels and rooms below ground surface. Underground mining is more expensive than surface mining and can be dangerous. This kind of mining is only used in areas where quality ore, such as gold, are concentrated in thin veins and other remarkably rich deposits.
