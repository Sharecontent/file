The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.

## Siderite - Mineral Properties, Photos and Occurence
Siderite is both an iron ore and gangue mineral. Its principal economic value lies in its high iron content and the absence of process contaminants such as sulfur or phosphorous. It is part of a large group of isomorphous minerals, the calcite group carbonates, which share similar physical properties, and rhombohedral crystal form.

## Calcination and Pelletizing of Siderite Ore
It must be economical to operate and use a mine as an ore. It is desirable that the blend grade of the iron ores used in the steel industry is at least 57% Fe grade. The iron ore is found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), limonite (FeO(OH)⋅nH 2 O), goethite (α-Fe 3+ O(OH)), siderite (FeCO 3) and pyrite (FeS 2

## Siderite
Spathic iron ore. Although spathic (carbonate) iron ores, such as siderite, have been economically important for steel production, they are far from ideal as an ore.. Their hydrothermal mineralisation tends to form them as small ore lenses, often following steeply dipping bedding planes. This makes them not amenable to opencast working, and increases the cost of working them by mining with

Mar 31, 2022Siderite is one of the common iron ores. The iron grade of siderite (FeCO 3) is low, and the theoretical iron grade is only 48.20%.Some of them also contain Mg and Mn. Moreover, siderite is weakly magnetic iron ore, most of the siderites are fine-grained and complex in composition, and belong to refractory iron ore resources.

## Iron Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The estimated GHG emissions were 11.9 kg CO 2 e for mining and processing 1 t of iron ore. The embodied energy values were 153 MJ/t ore for iron ore. The results showed that loading and hauling made the largest contributions (approximately 50%) to the total GHG emissions from the mining and processing of iron ore.
