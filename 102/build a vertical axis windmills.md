## Vertical-axis wind turbine
A vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) is a type of wind turbine where the main rotor shaft is set transverse to the wind while the main components are located at the base of the turbine. This arrangement allows the generator and gearbox to be located close to the ground, facilitating service and repair. VAWTs do not need to be pointed into the wind, which removes the need for wind-sensing and

## Vertical-axis wind turbines: what makes them better?
Efficiency - When the wind blows on the blades of a HAWT, all of them contribute to energy production. When wind blows on a vertical-axis turbine, only a fraction of the blades generate torque while the other parts merely 'go along for the ride'. The result is comparably reduced efficiency in power generation.

DIY VAWT - Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. In this project, we will build a small DIY VAWT, Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. We are not expecting to get much over 50 watts of production, though it would be fairly simple to double the size of the blade area to increase power. This DIY VAWT is based on the use of 4 inch PVC pipes, cut in half, for the blades.

Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity to make wind—like a fan—wind turbines use wind to make electricity. Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor, which spins a generator, which creates electricity.  Vertical-axis wind turbines come in several varieties, including the eggbeater
