A typical raw mix consists of 75-85% limestone, 12-25% shale, the balance consisting of silica or quartzite and iron oxide. Exact proportioning is dependent upon their chemical properties before and after calcining to cement clinker. For good kiln practice the grind required is 88-92% - 200 mesh for standard cement, 99%-200 mesh for high early.

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
