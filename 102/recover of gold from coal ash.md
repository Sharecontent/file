The gold in the ash will all be metallic but it will be so finely divided that gravity separation will not work. The gold can be dissolved in aqua regia or in cyanide solution. Usually with either of these leaches you carry out filtration after the dissolution and any un-ashed carbon on the filter is sent for re-ashing.

## Can Harvesting Rare Earth Elements Solve the Coal Ash Crisis?
Since the United States began burning coal on an industrial scale in the 19th century, upwards of 35 percent of the immolated material has fallen to the bottom of boilers as ash. That ash has then been removed, mixed with water, and placed in ponds and landfills. Over 3 billion tons of it now occupy more than 1,400 sites across the United States.

Incineration produces fly ash and bottom ash just as is the case when coal is combusted. The total amount of ash produced by municipal solid waste incineration ranges from 4 to 10% by volume and 15-20% by weight of the original quantity of waste, and the fly . get price

## Appalachian Coal Ash Richest in Rare Earth Elements
The results showed that ash collected from Appalachian Mountain coal has the highest amount of rare earth elements at 591 milligrams per kilogram (or parts per million). Ash from Illinois and the Powder River Basin contain 403 mg/kg and 337 mg/kg, respectively. The researchers then used a common industrial extraction technique featuring nitric
