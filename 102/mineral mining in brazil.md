Iron ore is the mineral of greatest value to Brazil's mining industry, representing 78% of total mining exports; $16.5 billion of a $22.5 billion industry in 2008. Over-reliance upon the production and export of iron ore to China, the overwhelming driver of demand for Brazil's iron ore, presents an acute risk to the industry.
