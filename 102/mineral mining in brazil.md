Brazil has several alluvial diamond sources, where stones are mined from the sands and gravels of river banks.

Iron ore is the mineral of greatest value to Brazil's mining industry, representing 78% of total mining exports; $16.5 billion of a $22.5 billion industry in 2008. Over-reliance upon the production and export of iron ore to China, the overwhelming driver of demand for Brazil's iron ore, presents an acute risk to the industry.
