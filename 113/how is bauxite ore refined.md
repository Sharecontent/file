## Production of aluminium from bauxiter-ukraine.shop
Bauxite is primarily comprised of aluminum oxide compounds (alumina), silica, iron oxides and titanium dioxide. Approximately 70 percent of the world's bauxite production is refined through the Bayer chemical process into alumina. Alumina is then refined into pure aluminum metal through the Hall-Héroult electrolytic process. Mining bauxite.

In the Bayer Process, the bauxite is washed in a hot solution of sodium hydroxide, which leaches aluminum from the bauxite. The aluminum is precipitated out of solution in the form of aluminum hydroxide, Al (OH) 3. The aluminum hydroxide is then calcined to form alumina, Al 2 O 3. Aluminum is smelted from the alumina using the Hall-Heroult Process.

## Bauxite - Norsk Hydro
Bauxite is a mixture of minerals that contain various concentrations of hydrated aluminum oxides, as well as impurities. The primary ore minerals are gibbsite (alumina tri-hydrate), boehmite and diaspore (alumina monohydrates) Gibbsite-rich bauxite is preferred as it can be refined at lower digestion temperatures than the other types of alumina

Aluminum is the most common metal element found on Earth, totaling about 8% of the Earth's crust. However, aluminum as an element is reactive and therefore does not occur naturally - it needs to be refined to produce aluminum metal. The primary starting material for aluminum refining is bauxite, the world's main commercial source of aluminum.

The main ore for the production of aluminium metal is bauxite which is refined to produce an oxide, alumina, which in turn is smelted to produce aluminium. Alternative sources of aluminium-bearing materials are being sought, but there is little likelihood of their displacing bauxite to any significant degree in the near future.
