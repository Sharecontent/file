## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
As quarry dust (also called as crushed sand) is a byproduct obtained after crushing of stones (rocks) to make aggregates. Results have shown that the concrete made using crushed sand attains the compressive strength earlier as compared to the concrete made of natural sand. Practically the concrete made of crushed sand is more homogeneous as compared to natural (river)sand, because cr.sand,aggregate and cement gets easily mixed having similar properties.
