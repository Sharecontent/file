## gyratory vs cone crusher
The cone crusher can crush a wide range of rocks from medium to hard. A cone crusher works in a similar way to a gyratory crusher, but in a cone crusher, the slope of the crushing space is not as steep. Although the cone crusher is well known for its ability to crush hard and abrasive ores and rocks, it is better suited for secondary crushing

## What is a Gyratory Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
The disadvantages of the gyratory crusher are also obvious: The structure is relatively complicated, the weight is large, the equipment is difficult to manufacture, the delivery time is long, and the price is expensive. The structure of the gyratory crusher is the same as that of the single-cylinder hydraulic cone crusher.

## Chamber Optimization for Comprehensive Improvement of Cone Crusher 
And the optimal values of key structural parameters were obtained. Finally, based on the iron ore coarsely crushed by the gyratory crusher, the dynamic characteristics of the C900 cone crusher were simulated by using the discrete element method (DEM), and the simulation results are basically consistent with the numerical analysis results.
