Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

At its peak in the 1920s, Illinois mines employed approximately 100,000 workers and produced 100 million tons of coal annually.

The town of Standardville was a model company town that was so well planned, it was intended to be the "standard" for other mining camps to follow. In February 1914 the company shipped its first coal and during that year the mine was producing about 200 tons of coal daily. A year later the output had increased fivefold.
