## Why slag is used in cement?f
What is slag used in concrete? Slag cement is a hydraulic cement formed when granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is ground to suitable fineness and is used to replace a portion of portland cement. It is a recovered industrial by-product of an iron blast furnace. What is slag used for? While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting, they can also serve other purposes, such

## Geotechnical Behavior of Recycled Copper Slag-Cement-Treated  - DeepDyve
Copper slag is a by-product obtained from production of copper metal. As copper slag contains silica and alumina, it may exhibit pozzolanic property, and hence it may be re-use in ground improvement applications as a partial replacement of cement. Present study evaluates systematically the possible pozzolanic property of copper slag as well as studies the effect of copper slag on engineering

## Copper Slag in Concrete As Replacement Material
Copper slag is an industrial by-product material produced during the process of manufacturing of copper. About 2.2 tonnes of copper slag is generated, for every ton of copper production. The primary objective of this paper is to study the application of copper slag as an alternative replacement material of sand. This paper also studies the effect of replacement of Fine aggregate with copper slag on mechanical properties of concrete.

Copper slag is used in the concrete as one of the alternative materials. It is the waste product of copper from Sterlite Industries India Ltd, Tuticorin. The safe disposal of this waste is a lack, costly and causes environmental pollution. The construction industry is the only area where the safe use of waste material (copper slag) is possible.

One of the greatest potential applications for reusing copper slag is in cement and concrete production. Many researchers have investigated the use of copper slag in the production of cement, mortar and concrete as raw materials for clinker, cement replacement, coarse and fine aggregates.

## Copper Slag: a Professional Blasting Material and an Effective 
Copper slag is also used for the production of composite cements as replacement for raw materials used in clinker production. Due to the high Fe content, copper slag acts as ferrous adjuvant in the clinker production, while its low melting point could reduce the calcination temperature for cement clinker.
