In fact, beyond 2040 - well within the lifetime of China's young fleet - there is practically no carbon budget for unabated coal generation. The next Five-Year Plan should set a clear cap on coal capacity and unabated coal use consistent with the long-term transition objective. The least efficient, most polluting plants would need to shut down.
