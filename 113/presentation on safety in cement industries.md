##  Air Polution and Air Pollution Control in Cement Industry
Cement industry's focus is on reducing ambient particulate emission by reducing the mass load emitted from the stacks, and other sources up to less than 0.2 kilograms of dust per metric ton (kg/t) of clinker using dust recovery systems. NOx emissions are controlled using proper kiln design, low-NOx burners, and an optimum level of excess air.
