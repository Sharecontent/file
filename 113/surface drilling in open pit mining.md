## Open-pit Mining - Mining North Works
Open-pit Mining, Open-pit mining occurs on surface and is generally the cheapest way to extract ore. This is because rock doesn't have to be moved far up hill against gravity, equipment used can be larger than underground, and it doesn't require more expensive features like ventilation, communications, etc. that underground does.

## Understanding the Open Pit Mining Process | Hawk Machinery
Sep 28, 2020Overview of Open Pit Mining Process. Open pit mining, which is also known as open cast or open cut mining, is a type of surface mining process that extracts rock or minerals from the ground from an open-air pit. This type of mining process is mostly used in the mining industry around the world as it does not require the presence of tunnels.

## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness

## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, [1] is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow . This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.
