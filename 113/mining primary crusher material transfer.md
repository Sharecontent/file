## Cost Of Primary Crushers - Facty Mining Machinery
The most important characteristics of a primary crusher are the capacity and the ability to accept raw material without blockages. A large primary crusher is more expensive to purchase than a smaller machine. For this reason investment cost calculations for primary crushers are weighed against the costs of blasting raw material to a smaller size.

## thyssenkrupp: New crusher revolutionizes material processing in mining 
With the development of a completely new type of crusher, the so-called eccentric roll crusher type ERC25-25, thyssenkrupp has achieved a quantum leap in primary crushing. The new crusher features a particularly flat and robust design and high throughputs of up to 3,000 tons per hour, enabling it to process hard rock and ores efficiently and economically in underground mining operations.

The graph displays a trend that favours the modified section of the trial blast. An average crusher throughput of 191 tonnes per hour was calculated from the reference section of the blast and 234 tph calculated from the modified end. This equates to an 18.3 per cent improvement in primary crusher throughput for the modified section.
