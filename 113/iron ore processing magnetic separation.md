How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.

##  Magnetic Elutriation Technology for Clean and Efficient Processing of 
Magnetic elutriation improves the quality of low-grade domestic iron ore by using an alternating-current, pulsed-magnetic field to clean iron ore into a highly refined product. This innovative process differs from conventional drum type magnetic separation systems by using permanent magnets that cause magnetic entrapment.
