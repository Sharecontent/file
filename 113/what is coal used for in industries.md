Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

Due to global warming, technologies reducing CO2 emissions in the metallurgical industry are being sought. One possibility is to use bio-coke as a substitute for classic coke made of 100% fossil coal. Bio-coke can be produced on the basis of coal with the addition of substances of biomass origin. Blends for the production of bio-coke should have appropriate coke-making properties to ensure the

## About the Coal Industry
Coal is by far Canada's most abundant fossil fuel, with 6.6 billion tonnes of recoverable coal reserves. Canada has anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous, and lignite coal deposits. More than 90% of Canada's coal deposits are located in western provinces, which provides a strategic advantage because of the close proximity of west coast ports.

Coal-Fired Power Plants. Coal is still used as a fuel today, though less for home heating and more for firing industrial boilers and generators. It is primarily used for generating electricity, via coal-burning power plants. The principle is simple. Combusted in a boiler, the coal releases heat that converts water into steam.
