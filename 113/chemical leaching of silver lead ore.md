## silver processing | Britannica
silver processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Silver has long been valued for its white metallic lustre, its ability to be readily worked, and its resistance to the corrosive effects of moisture and oxygen. The lustre of the pure metal is due to its electron configuration, which results in its reflecting all electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths longer than 3000

Cyanidation tests on two ore samples from two different gold deposits are reported. The first sample contained 10.5. ppm gold with high arsenic and antimony.. The second sample had a low gold content (2.5 ppm) but a high silver content (160 ppm).The first series of test work focused on the determination of conditions for extracting gold from the samples ground to − 75 μm.

## Explain the leaching process of silver and gold using class 12 
Hint: The leaching process of Gold and silver is also called the Mac-Arthur Forrest cyanide process. The extraction process of these less reactive metals are made to react with cyanide salts and made into water soluble complexes. Then this solution formed is treated with a good suitable reducing agent and then metal is made free from solution.
