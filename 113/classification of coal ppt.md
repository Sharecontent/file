## Fossil Fuels Coal Petroleum - Introduction, Classification  - VEDANTU
The three primary fossil fuels are coal, petroleum, natural gas. Among these three, coal and oil are used widely to serve a wide array of purposes. This includes transportation fuel, electricity generation, heating buildings and houses, steel and paper production, and so on. These two fuels coal and petrol have been discussed in detail below.

##  COAL PETROLOGY: MACROSCOPIC COMPONENTS OF COAL - Auroma
COAL PETROLOGY: Coal type is related to the type of plant material in the peat and the extent of its biochemical and chemical alteration. Type can be assessed in terms of variety of petrographic analysis. Coal petrology is concerned with the origin, composition and properties of the distinct organic and inorganic components of different coals.
