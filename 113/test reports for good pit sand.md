## What is Pit sand? - availability, advantage & their use.
Excavation of pit sand (fig. 1) The sand i.e. procured forming a pit, by excavating normally between 1 meter to 8 meters beneath the earth's surface is termed as pit sand. The pit sand particles are usually angular in shape with a rough surface and sharp edge as compared to the river sand. Due to the weathering action with the water, river sand

Note down Volume 2 of the settled sand. Repeat the procedure to get an average value. Percentage of silt content = ( V1 /V2 ) X 100. Where; V1 - Volume of the silt layer. V2 - Volume of the sand layer. For example, for a given sand sample, if V1 comes out to be 10 and V2 is 140, the %age of silt content would be 7.14%.

## Why Put Sand in The Bottom of a Fire Pit? - Delta Fire Pits
Sand, as mentioned above, dramatically decreases the effect of heat on the fire pit. In addition, it also protects the metal itself from extreme heat. It even distributes the heat throughout the entire base of the bonfire itself. In addition, it distributes it so its not centered into one place. So, sand works as an insulator against high

Test Procedure. First, we have to fill the measuring cylinder with 1% solution of salt and water up to 50 ml. Add sand to it until the level reaches 100 ml. Then fill the solution up to 150 ml level. Cover the cylinder and shake it well (as shown in video) After 3 hours, the silt content settled down over the sand layer.

Classification of Sand: According to the size of grains, the sand is classified as fine, coarse and gravelly. ADVERTISEMENTS: The sand passing through a screen with clear openings of 1.5875 mm is known as the fine sand. It is mainly used for plastering. The sand passing through a screen with clear openings of 3.175 mm is known as the coarse sand.
