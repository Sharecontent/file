## Basic Layout and Working of a Thermal Power Plant
A simplified layout of a thermal power station is shown below. Coal: In a coal based thermal power plant, coal is transported from coal mines to the generating station. Generally, bituminous coal or brown coal is used as fuel. The coal is stored in either 'dead storage' or in 'live storage'. Dead storage is generally 40 days backup coal storage
