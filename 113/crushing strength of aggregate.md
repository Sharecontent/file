## Effect of Coarse Aggregate Size Variation on Compressive Strength of 
The crushing strength of aggregate was calculated by adopting the procedures as standardized in IS:2386 part IV. In a cylindrical measure of 11.5 cm diameter & 18 cm height the dry aggregate passing through 12.5mm size sieve & retained in 10mm size sieve was filled in three layers. For measuring the resistance of aggregates to crushing under

## Mechanical Properties of Aggregate - Construction How
Greater is the aggregate crushing value, softer is the aggregate sample and vice versa. This is suggestive of the fact that the resistance of aggregates to crushing is less. Therefore, the strength of such a sample is also less. Aggregates having relatively less ACV can be used in wearing surfaces of pavements. 2)Hardness

Procedure for crushing strength of aggregate. Before testing, the aggregate should be in surface dry condition.You can achieve the dry condition of aggregate by placing aggregates in an oven for 4 hours at 100-degree Celcius. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm and retained on 10mm IS sieves are selected for finding aggregate crushing strength.
