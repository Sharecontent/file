The worst mining disaster in Minnesota happened in 1924 on the Cuyuna Range. Forty-one miners drowned in the Milford mine when a nearby lake broke through the underground mine, flooding the tunnels. The mines attracted immigrants from almost every nation in Europe. Thousands of immigrants were arriving in America at the same time as the mines

## Rare Earth Mining and Exploration in North America
Abstract. The occurrences of rare earth elements (REEs) in North America are abundant and diverse in mineralogy and geology. The Mountain Pass carbonatite in California historically has been a major world source for the light REEs. Monazite sands have also been mined on a moderate level in the southeastern United States.
