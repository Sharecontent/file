## Rare Earth Mining and Exploration in North America
Abstract. The occurrences of rare earth elements (REEs) in North America are abundant and diverse in mineralogy and geology. The Mountain Pass carbonatite in California historically has been a major world source for the light REEs. Monazite sands have also been mined on a moderate level in the southeastern United States.
