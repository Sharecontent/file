## Grinding Machine: Definition, Parts, Working Principle, Operation 
Grinding Machine Working Principle: In brief, we can say the working of the Grinding Machine is the Workpiece is fed against the rotating abrasive wheel. The action of rubbing or friction generates between wok price and tool therefore the material removes. Lets see step by step, First, clean the machine with a clean brush.

Dual grinding machines deliver a two-step process that combines centerless grinding with grinding between centers, alleviating concentricity concerns. In the Zone. Regardless of machine design, the workpiece is guided by its outer surface during centerless grinding. Because of this, roundness can be a concern, especially lobing and triangulation.
