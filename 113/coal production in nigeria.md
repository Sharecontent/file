## Africa's Coal Producing Countries To Exploit Increasing Global Demand
With the world coal demand growing and South Africa being the source of 92 percent of coal consumed in Africa, Nigeria has a market it can break into if it gets things right in its coal industry. Business Day reports that Nigeria has proven coal reserves of about 639 million metric tonnes and contingent reserves of up to 2.75 billion metric tonnes.

The leading role of Coal in the Nigerian energy mix started to decline with the discovery of oil in commercial quantity in Nigeria in the late 1950's and was hastened by the Nigerian civil war which took place between 1967- 1970 during which period all the Coal Mines in the country were abandoned.

## Coal mining in Enugu district, Nigeria | EJAtlas
Coal generated lots of revenue for Nigeria between the years 1916 and 1970 when it was one of Nigeria's major revenue earners. In the south eastern part of the country, mining exploration began in present day Enugu State in 1909, with production at the mines in Onyeama, Ogbete, Iva Valley and Okpara climbing from 25, 511 tons in1916 to an estimated 583,422 tons before a decline set in during

In 1909, coal was discovered in Enugu, Nigeria. The Ogbete drift mine opened six years later. The Ogbete mine's operations and others in the country were merged into a new corporation in 1950: The Nigerian Coal Corporation. The NCC was tasked with exploiting coal resources, [2] and held a monopoly on coal and coke mining, production, and sales

## Coal
What is Nigeria's coal policy? The National Energy Master Plan (NEMP) of 2014 foresaw a major role for coal.
