## The Phosphate Fertilizer Industry: An Environmental Overview
The complexities of keeping a phosphate processing plant operating are becoming clear to government regulators now overseeing two of them. Ponds full of 1.5 billion gallons of acid and three mountains of radioactive waste mean you just can't shut off the machinery and turn out the lights. The state could be stuck with the plants for years.

## Phosphorus - Nutrient Management | Mosaic Crop Nutrition
Phosphorus is a vital component of DNA, the genetic "memory unit" of all living things. It is also a component of RNA, the compound that reads the DNA genetic code to build proteins and other compounds essential for plant structure, seed yield and genetic transfer. The structures of both DNA and RNA are linked together by phosphorus bonds.

The phosphoric acid plant generates dust and fumes, both of which contain hydrofluoric acid, silicon tetrafluoride, or both. Phosphogypsum generated in the process (at an approximate rate of about 5 tons per ton of phosphoric acid produced) is most often disposed of as a slurry to a storage/settling pond or waste heap.

## Processing Phosphates for Use in the Fertilizer Industry
Conclusion. Phosphate is a key component in sustaining healthy and productive crops. While most phosphate rock goes to the production of MAP and DAP fertilizers, this life-giving mineral can be made into a variety of fertilizer products and blends through the process of granulation. FEECO has been a leader in the fertilizer industry since 1951.
