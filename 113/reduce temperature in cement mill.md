## Methods of Limiting Temperature of Concrete - Structural Guide
The common practice is to limit the temperature difference between the external concrete surface and the core to Celsius 20. However, in some projects, this value is kept at Celsius 25 considering the scale and type of concrete to be used. Further, the temperature gradient is not allowed to exceed Celsius 25 per linear meter.

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
