Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

## Iron ore
Bog ore often has a high phosphorus content.(Gordon 1996, p. 57) The strength and hardness of iron increases with the concentration of phosphorus. 0.05% phosphorus in wrought iron makes it as hard as medium carbon steel. High phosphorus iron can also be hardened by cold hammering. The hardening effect is true for any concentration of phosphorus.

Work in CSIRO with several Australian ores has shown thatby heating a high-phosphorus goethitic iron ore and then leaching with caustic or acid, the phosphorus levels in the ore can be lowered to a commercially acceptable value of around 0.08 weight per cent phosphorus (P). With increasing heating temperatures up to 1300C, the extent of phosphorus removal increased. This is considered to be

## Dephosphorization of High-Phosphorus Iron Ore Using Different Sources 
High-phosphorus iron ore is traditionally dephosphorized by chemical process with inorganic acids. However, this process is not recommended nowadays because of its high cost and consequent environmental pollution. With the current tendency for development of a low-cost and eco-friendly process, dephosphorization of high-phosphorus iron ore
