## List of Magnetic Metals - Science Notes and Projects
Mar 2, 2021Magnetic metals include iron, nickel, cobalt, and steel. Magnetic materials are attracted to a magnet and may even become magnetized. Nearly all magnetic materials are metals. Familiar examples of magnetic metals include iron, nickel, cobalt, and steel. But, magnetism is a complex phenomenon. Not all iron or steel is magnetic.

## Structural and magnetic properties of iron, cobalt and nickel 
Highlights Iron, cobalt and nickel nanoparticles were synthesized with agarose polysaccharide by sol-gel method and heat-treating technique. XRD studies showed that the prepared products were iron, cobalt and nickel with bcc, fcc and fcc structure, respectively. Compared with bulk products, the nanoproducts exhibit significant increase in magnetic anisotropy as a reflection of nanodimension.

## Effective spin quantum numbers in iron, cobalt and nickel
Using additionally the known data for the saturation magnetic moments and the effective paramagnetic Bohr magneton numbers it is suggested that for nickel the effective spin is S=1/2 for T→0 but S=1 for higher temperatures including the paramagnetic phase. For iron and cobalt the corresponding values are S=3/2 and 2.

## Which Metals Are Magnetic? | Metal Supermarkets UK
The most common metals used for permanent magnets are iron, nickel, cobalt and some alloys of rare earth metals. There are two types of permanent magnets: those from "hard" magnetic materials and those from "soft" magnetic materials. "Hard" magnetic metals tend to stay magnetized over a long period. Common examples are:

In other elements, like chromium, the spins align antiparallel, so that no net magnetic polarization results. Other elements simply lack the open d-shell while other elements are ferromagnetic in principle, but the effect is weak so that their Curie point is below room temperature (e.g. Holmium).

The iron-nickel alloy proved to be ferromagnetic and could be recovered quite readily by magnetic methods. Slow Cooling Because increased grain size in the matte was expected to enhance the separation efficiency, several lots of mattes were slow cooled for periods ranging from 6 hours up to 2-½ days.

## Magnetism from the Atom to the Bulk in Iron, Cobalt, and Nickel 
Molecular beam deflection measurements of small iron, cobalt, and nickel clusters show how magnetism develops as the cluster size is increased from several tens to several hundreds of atoms for temperatures between 80 and 1000 K. Ferromagnetism occurs even for the smallest sizes: for clusters with fewer than about 30 atoms the magnetic moments are atomlike; as the size is increased up to 700

In terms of objects readily found in a house, the ones that stick to a permanent magnet do so because they probably contain iron, nickel, or cobalt. Considering that steel is such a common building material, and steel contains mostly iron, most of the magnetism experienced outside laboratories is due to iron.

2 days agoThe very first modern permanent magnets were the aluminum-nickel-iron magnets, which were produced in Tokyo, 1932. After twenty years of research and development, it was found that replacing the iron in the equation with cobalt considerably enhanced the properties of the magnets. Hence, the aluminum-nickel-cobalt magnets came into production.

Iron, cobalt and nickel are good magnetic substances . That's why they have a good property of getting attracted towards a magnet . Do magnets attract magnetic materials by inducing magnetism in them? If you think about the magnet in detail it is an aggregation of atoms and molecules each with its own field of magnetism.

When cobalt is combined with another metal to make an alloy its magnetic properties are even more apparent than the individual  [1, 2, 3]. It is. Its physical properties resemble iron and nickel. Cobalt is a ferromagnetic (strongest magnet), up to 1121 0 C. Its specific gravity is 8.9. Pure cobalt is obtained through smelting process, which

## Iron Nickel Cobalt Alloy | AMERICAN ELEMENTS
Cobalt is found in cobaltite, erythrite, glaucodot and skutterudite ores. Cobalt produces brilliant blue pigments which have been used since ancient times to color paint and glass. Cobalt is a ferromagnetic metal and is used primarily in the production of magnetic and high-strength superalloys. Co-60, a commercially important radioisotope, is

## What Are Magnetic Substances - Realonomics
Iron Nickel and Cobalt are the magnetic substances as objects made up of these materials are attracted by a magnet. Also magnetic materials can be magnetized or we can say that magnetic materials can be converted into magnets. What are 4 magnetic substances? Magnetic metals include: Iron. Nickel. Cobalt. Some alloys of rare earth metals.
