## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

Figure 6 shows the relationship between nanoparticle size and melting point for gold according to the Gibbs-Thomson equation. As we can see, the melting point of gold nanoparticles can be even lower than room temperature (~23-25 °C) when the size decreases to less than about 1.4 nm. At that size, there are only about 85 atoms present in each.

## Copper Refining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the electrolytic process, copper is electrodeposed to obtain a spongy powder deposit at the cathode rather than a smooth, adherent one. In this feature, it differs from the process of copper refining where a strongly adherent product is desired. Low copper ion concentration and high acid content in the electrolyte favor formation of powder deposits.
