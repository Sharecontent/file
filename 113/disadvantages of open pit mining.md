## What are two advantages of open pit mining? - Short-Question
Disadvantages of open pit mining. One of the main disadvantages of this type of mining operation is the environmental impact it causes. Since cyanide, mercury and sulfuric acid are used to remove the wastewater, groundwater and air are contaminated as toxic dust . This is absorbed by animals and plants.

## What Is The Most Likely Consequence Of Open Pit Mining On Plant Life 
Open-pit mining includes blasting of soil and vegetation to access underground ore layers or coal seams [17]. Consequently this method produces large volumes of mining waste including soil and overburden which increase the vulnerability of mining environments to soil erosion and pollution.

## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness
