## Synchronous Motor : Working Principle, Types, and Applications - ElProCus
Synchronous Motor Working Principle. Working of synchronous motors depends on the interaction of the magnetic field of the stator with the magnetic field of the rotor. The stator contains 3 phase windings and is supplied with 3 phase power. Thus, stator winding produces a 3 phased rotating Magnetic- Field. DC supply is given to the rotor.

## Synchronous Motor: Features, Applications, Advantages and Disadvantages
Oct 30, 2021The synchronous motors have the following advantages −. It operates at a constant speed (i.e., synchronous speed) from no-load to full-load. Power factor of a synchronous motor can be easily controlled by changing the excitation of the motor. For low speed (< 300 RPM) applications, synchronous motors are more economical than induction motors.

## What Is Synchronous Motor and Its Advantages and Disadvantages
What is synchronous motor Synchronous motor is an AC motor that generates a torque by a DC-powered excitation magnetic field that interacts with a rotating magnetic field of the armature to rotate at a synchronous speed. The structure of the synchronous motor is basically the same as that of the synchronous generator, and the rotor is also divided into a salient pole and a hidden pole. But

## Advantages of Asynchronous vs Synchronous Motor in Starting Torque 
Another advantage of this approach is that it tends to drive DOWN the required starting current (same volts applied to a higher resistance circuit means lower amperes). Then again - synchronous motors are generally a lower draw than a similar induction design. As a rough estimate - the synch machine typically is designed to draw roughly 70

## Synchronous Motor - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Synchronous motors are inherently not able to self-start on an AC power source with the utility frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. As stated in Chapter 1, this is because synchronous motors can develop a torque only when running at the synchronous speed.However, the synchronous speed for the utility frequency is too fast for the rotor to synchronize for starting as shown in Fig. 3.63.

## Difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Motor
The synchronous motor is a type of AC motor that runs at synchronous speed. The asynchronous motor is a type of AC motor that runs on speed less than the synchronous speed. It operates on the principle of magnetic interlocking between rotor and stator field. It operates on the principle of electromagnetic induction between stator and rotor.
