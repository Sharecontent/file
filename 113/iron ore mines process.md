Iron ore deposits may lie deep underground. A shaft must be dug from the surface and an elevator or hoist must be installed. . Stopes are the chambers in which ore is broken and mined. Cars or other conveyors carry the ore to the shaft where it is hoisted to the surface. What is iron mining? Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the
