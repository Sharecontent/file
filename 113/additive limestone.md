## Dust control strategy in limestone mine prevents fugitive dust 
Using additives, limestone dust particles are able to agglomerate with each other, increasing in size and weight and making them less likely to become airborne, thus preventing fugitive emissions. With an approximate 300:1 water-to-additive ratio, the MEL-101 supports the water's role in providing dust suppression using economically
