## Improving the geotechnical properties of high expansive clay using 
Limestone powder. There are different factories in Erbil city which produce limestone powder for use as a filler in the asphalt mix design. According to the previous studies, there were few studies found on using only limestone powder (i.e., most of the particle sizes less than 0.075 mm) for stabilization of high expansive soils.
