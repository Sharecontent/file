## Evaluation and Risk Analysis of Open-Pit Mining Operations
Mining of raw materials is a process that consists of several stages. In open-pit mining, material with high compressive strength is extracted by drilling and blasting and material with low compressive strength is extracted by e. g. a bucket wheel excavator. Most important influencing factors for crusher decision are compressive strength, moisture content, capacity of crusher, abrasiveness

## Earth Environmental — Coal Mining Risk Assessment
Coal mining risk assessment is a well-established procedure for determining whether a development site is in a high-risk area. In a high-risk area, a development proposal requires a valid proposal plan. Another purpose of a coal mine risk assessment is to identify coal mine risks at the development site and develop a plan to ensure the safety and sustainability of the development site.

## Risk assessment of coal mine water inrush based on PCA-DBN
Abstract. To provide an effective risk assessment of water inrush for coal mine safety production, a BP neural network prediction method for water inrush based on principal component analysis and deep confidence network optimization was proposed. Because deep belief network (DBN) is disadvantaged by a long training time when establishing a high

## Climate risk and decarbonization: What every mining CEO needs to know 
Mining is currently responsible for 4 to 7 percent of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions globally. Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO 2 emissions from the sector (those incurred through mining operations and power consumption, respectively) amount to 1 percent, and fugitive-methane emissions from coal mining are estimated at 3 to 6 percent. 1
