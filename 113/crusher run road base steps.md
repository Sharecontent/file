On top of the subgrade, for most industrial slabs, a subbase is placed.

## Readers ask: Sand Or Gravel Under Concrete Slab?
Pour concrete over a solid, well-drained base. Because concrete slabs "float" on the soil, soft ground or voids underneath may cause unsupported areas to crack under heavy weight like vehicles. Pack about 4 in. of sand or gravel over clay and other poorly draining soils to provide even support.

This will work as a mechanical barrier to stabilize and stop the clay from mixing with your good sub-base materials. Do not dump in your base materials. Most traditional plate compactors will not compact any more than 4" of base. If you try to compact 6" of base, you will only compact the top 4" and the bottom 2" will settle in the future.

It has good bonding qualities. Tar is still present in recycled asphalt. This means that recycled asphalt will bond better than loose driveway products and materials. When wet and compacted, recycled asphalt will bond easily. This will produce a semi-permanent driveway, which keeps dust and dirt in place.
