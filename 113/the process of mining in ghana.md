There are two legally distinct types of small-scale gold mines in Ghana. Since there is a formalized process for mining gold on the small-scale, there are legally recognized small-scale mines. Small-scale mining permits can be acquired for a parcel of land by Ghanaian citizens who are over 18 years old (Ghana Government 1989a).

Ensuring Mining Contributes to Sustainable Development. Ghana's mining history, particularly gold, dates back to the fifteenth century. The industry was very vibrant during the pre-independence period when mining policy was largely geared towards assisting and promoting the maximization of mineral production in the interests of the colonial powers. Therefore, for example, Ghana accounted for 36% of total world gold output (8,153,426 fine ounces) between 1493 and 1600 when there were more

Mining and quarrying companies in Ghana face challenges when it comes to obtaining licenses and permits, land acquisition and community disputes. Often the process of exploration and setting up mining operations is slowed by these factors. Mining company operators must work closely with the communities in the area they intend to mine, and often face demands for financial compensation or investment in the community in order to gain access to mining areas.
