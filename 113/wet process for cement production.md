## Wet Process - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Four manufacturing processes are, or were, in use: •. The wet process. The raw material is ground in water (30-40 % of water) and treated in a long kiln (up to 250 m). This process has practically been discontinued. Only one plant was using this process in 2001, among 20 cement plants that were operating in France.

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of
