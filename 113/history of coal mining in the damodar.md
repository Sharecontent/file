## History of Coal in India - Green Clean Guide
Dec 20, 2020The early coal mine is documented in ancient China. It is a known fact that coal has played an important role in the industrial revolution, where it was primarily used to produce thermal energy and power steam engines. Coal has been mined in India since 1774, pioneered by the East India Company at Raniganj Coalfield, bank of Damodar River.

 A Brief History of Strip Mining Coal strip mining was begun nearly 75 years ago in Vermilion County where the coal seam was overlaid by a thin cover. Open cut or strip mining has been defined as the relatively simple process of removing the soil overlying shallow mineral deposits and of mining directly from the exposed seams.

## History of Coal Mining - Early History - LiquiSearch
The demand for coal steadily increased in Britain during the 15th century, but it was still mainly being used in the mining districts, in coastal towns or being exported to continental Europe. However, by the middle of the 16th century supplies of wood were beginning to fail in Britain and the use of coal as a domestic fuel rapidly expanded.

## India's Energy Security: Coal Sector - INSIGHTSIAS
Coal is formed by fossils of plants, trees, bushes etc. which got deposited in shallow basins millions of year ago. Later decomposition by bacteria converts it into peat, which is generally unviable to mine. After this bio- chemical action ceases and geo chemical action becomes dominant.

Damodar River (Pron: /ˈdʌmoˌdaː/) is a river flowing across the Indian states of Jharkhand and West Bengal.Rich in mineral resources, the valley is home to large-scale mining and industrial activity. Earlier known as the Sorrow of Bengal because of its ravaging floods in the plains of West Bengal, the Damodar and its tributaries have been somewhat tamed with the construction of several dams.

Mining coal was incredibly dangerous work. During the industrial coal boom between 1880 and 1923, more than 70,000 miners died on the job. Many more perished from occupational diseases, but weren't tallied in official statistics. Miners were crushed to death in roof collapses, killed by gas explosions and by machinery, and more.

Longwall mining is one of the oldest methods of mining coal. Before the widespread use of conveyor belts, ponies would descend to the deep, narrow channels and haul the coal back to the surface. Today, almost a third of American coal mines use longwall mining. Outside the U.S., that number is even higher. In China, the world's largest coal

The history of coal mining goes back thousands of years, with early mines documented in ancient China, the Roman Empire and other early historical economies. It became important in the Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries, when it was primarily used to power steam engines, heat buildings and generate electricity. Coal mining continues as an important economic activity today

The Great Depression of the 1930s lowered the demand to 360 million short tons in 1932. Under John L. Lewis, the United Mine Workers (UMW) became the dominant force in the coal fields in the 1930s and 1940s, producing high wages and benefits. In 1914 at the peak there were 180,000 anthracite miners; by 1970 only 6,000 remained.
