## Substation Grounding: Role of Crushed Rock - Voltage Disturbance
Application of crushed rock is a means of controlling step voltage and touch voltage. Step Voltage: During a fault condition, a person walking on the surface of substation can experience a voltage potential between his two feet (typically assumed to be 3.3ft or 1m apart). This causes a current to flow from one feet-through his body- to other feet.

The concrete we did ourselves as well, borrowed a friends concrete mixer.
