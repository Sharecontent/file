## The incredible marble extraction process - Stone and Style
September 13, 2013. Marble deposits can be exploited in open pits, it can be 95% on outdoor quarries and 5% in caves or mines. Marble is located at ground level or at great depths which make the cost too high for removal. Formerly, the extraction of this stone was done manually with wooden wedges, halters, ropes, picks and shovels. Nowadays

Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench Quarrying." The bench quarrying creates, bench wall which is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Once mining has begun, there may be several months of excavating before any marble is mined from the quarry.
