From the appearance of jaw crusher, it is easy to see two large iron wheels on both sides of jaw crusher, we call them flywheels. The two flywheels are at each end of the eccentric shaft, and one of the flywheels is used to connect the triangle belt and the eccentric shaft to transfer the kinetic energy. The other is regarded as useless by many

## Dodge Crushers - SolidsWiki
Dodge Crushers are Jaw Crushers wherein the moving plate is pivoted at the bottom and connected to an eccentric shaft. In universal crushers the plates are pivoted in the middle so that both the top and the bottom ends can move. The movable jaw is hinged at the bottom of the crusher frame so that the maximum amplitude of motion is obtained at the top of the crushing jaws.
