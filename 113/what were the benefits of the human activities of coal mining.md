## Human activity - Montane Cordillera
Human Activities. Human activities in the Montane Cordillera range from dangerous work to vacations and trips. Agriculture, Mining and Forestry are the main or leading activity in this ecozone. Because of the vast abundance of trees and also the quality of these trees, the ecozone has become known for its forestry.

## Death
Death is the irreversible cessation of all biological functions that sustain an organism. It can also be defined as the irreversible cessation of functioning of the whole brain, including brainstem. Brain death is sometimes used as a legal definition of death. The remains of a former organism normally begin to decompose shortly after death. Death is an inevitable process that eventually occurs

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Local communities can reap better benefits from mining if  - ECDPM
Extractive activity can affect local communities through at least three broad channels: market, fiscal, and environmental. The market channel works when the incomes of members of the local communities rise because they obtain employment with local mining firms, command higher wages, or supply them with goods and services through backward linkages with other sectors.

Coal is one of the most controversial sources of modern energy. In America about 29% of the electricity we use is generated by power plants that burn coal. Coal is a plentiful but non-renewable resource. But coal is a form of carbon and when we burn coal we release carbon into the atmosphere, which contributes to global warming.
