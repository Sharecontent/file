## Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses, Advantages and
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

1 Calculation of ball mill capacity. The production capacity of the ball mill is determined by the amount of material required to be ground, and it must have a certain margin when designing and selecting.

## Ball Mill - RETSCH - powerful grinding and homogenization
The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input. The innovative design of both, the mills and the grinding jars, allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time - with only minor warming effects. These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.
