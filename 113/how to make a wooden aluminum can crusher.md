Step 3: Drill Holes. The decision of whether to make a large or small can crusher is up to you. However, we recommend a 16-inch can crusher as that would be the most for use at home. You begin by marking the holes in the wooden boards and drilling them using a drilling machine.

Step 1: Cut Out Pieces From Wood and PVC. Here are the pieces you will need to cut out. I used a router circle jig to cut the crusher head. It does not have to be perfect, nor round. For the can holder, I used a piece of PVC pipe that was just large enough for a can. You can use a coping saw, or hack saw to cut the PVC.

Crushing aluminum cans is quick and easy for Joe Parnell of Rocky Point, North Carolina, who made a can compacting attachment for his wood splitter that makes the job easy. What makes his crusher unique is that it has a hopper that crushes a bunch of cans at once, rather than one at a time.

Crushing aluminum cans is quick and easy for Mike Steele, South Elgin, Ill., who made a heavy-duty, hand-operated can crusher out of treated scrap wood. "I just push down on a hinged handle to crush the can against a diamond steel plate. The compressed can falls through a slot at the back of a trough and down into a bucket," says Steele.
