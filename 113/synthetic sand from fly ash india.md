The silica sand and fly ash of each 100 g was sieved through a set of sieve having different sieve sizes (4.75 mm, 4 mm, 2.36 mm, 600 Î¼m, 212 Î¼m, 150 Î¼m, 106 Î¼m, and 75 Î¼m).

In India nearly 130 MT of fly ash is spewed out annually (Burke, 2007). Hence disposal of fly ash is the major environmental concern.  Different types of fly ash bricks such as clay- fly ash bricks, fly ash- sand-lime and fly ash -sandlime -gypsum bricks are used for construction purposes and other civil works (Bhattacharjee & Kandpal, 2002

## Fly Ash Topic - American Concrete Institute
Fly ash is a by-product from the combustion of pulverized coal, and is widely used as an ingredient in hydraulic-cement concrete. Because it improves many desirable properties of concrete, it is introduced either as a separately batched material or as a component of blended cement. Fly ash reacts with the hydrating hydraulic cement to form a cementing medium.
