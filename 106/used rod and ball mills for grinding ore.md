## Grinding Mills and Their Types - IspatGuru
Grinding mills are size reductions machines that often follow crushers in the processes where finer products are desired after crushing. Different grinding machines are usually named as mills, for example rod mills, ball mills, and attrition mills. Because of the name, verb milling is also been used as a synonym for grinding.

The general ore grinding process in most overseas ore beneficiation plants is made up of crusher, rod mill and ball mill. The rod mill is hardly used in China ore beneficiation plant. The feeding particle of ball mill is too high, which causes the large consumption of energy, grinding medium and lining plate.

Rod Mills are similar with the Ball Mills xcept they use long rods for grinding media. The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.

## Rod Mill
Overview. Rod mills are mainly used for primary grinding of crushed ore with a particle size range up to 50 mm for soft materials, and between 20 and 30 mm for harder materials where a narrow product size distribution is required (e.g. for subsequent gravity separation). Rod mills create a coarser product than do ball mills and typically operate at a slower mill speed.

## What's the Difference Between Ball Mills and Rod Mills
The finesse of the material milled by the ball mill is 0.074mm-0.4mm, only except for the two small ball mills that have a wider range of 0.075-0.89mm. However, the rod mill fine grinding fineness is about 0.833-0.147mm. In terms of the fineness of the ground material, the ball mill has a finer handling ability.
