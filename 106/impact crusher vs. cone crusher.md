The common secondary crushers are cone, roll, and impact types. The cone crusher (Fig. 13.12) is very similar to the gyratory type, except that it has a much shorter spindle with a larger-diameter crushing surface relative to its vertical dimension. The spindle is not suspended as in the gyratory crusher.

The biggest difference between jaw crusher and impact crusher is: jaw crusher is always used as the primary crusher while the impact crusher is always used as the secondary crusher. Jaw crusher has the characteristic of high impact resistance. So it is suitable for the primary crushing. The impact resistance of impact crusher is small, but it

## Comparison between Cone Crusher and Jaw Crusher - Virily
A Jaw crusher is used for the purpose of primary crushing. Thus the stones fed as input are of a large size. A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

## Impact Crushers VS Jaw Crushers
Compared with the impact crushers, jaw crushers use the compression force to break down materials. When the material is poured into the chamber and fall though chamber, it will be crushed 2 to 4 times. The reduction ratio of this machine is about 6:1. Besides the higher reduction ratios, the impact crushers is more useful to make a more cubical
