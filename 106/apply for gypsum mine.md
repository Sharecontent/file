## Gypsum Mine Trail (Cheticamp) - All You Need to Know BEFORE You Go
The Gypsum Mine was where they used to mine gypsum. Eventually the mine was closed. They turned this for trails and a lovely lake, where people swim in it, generally in the evening. Everyone we met, encouraged us to visit this abandoned mine. It was amazing. I liked the lake the most, especially since the sun was reflecting its rays on it.

## Gypsum Mineral | Uses and Properties - Geology
What is Gypsum? Gypsum is an evaporite mineral most commonly found in layered sedimentary deposits in association with halite, anhydrite, sulfur, calcite, and dolomite.Gypsum (CaSO 4. 2H 2 O) is very similar to Anhydrite (CaSO 4).The chemical difference is that gypsum contains two waters and anhydrite is without water. Gypsum is the most common sulfate mineral.
