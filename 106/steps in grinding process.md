## Grinding process
The abrasive grains are the cutting tool of a grinding wheel. They actually cut small pieces or chips off the work as the wheel rotates. The shape of each grain is irregular with several sharp cutting edges. When these edges grow dull, the forces acting on the wheel tend to fracture the abrasive grains and produce new cutting edges.

In grinding, an abrasive material rubs against the metal part and removes tiny pieces of material. The abrasive material is typically on the surface of a wheel or belt and abrades material in a way similar to sanding. On a microscopic scale, the chip formation in grinding is the same as that found in other machining processes.

For example, steel with a hardness between 35 and 65 HRC (medium-hard to hard steels) is relatively easy to prepare.

## Metal Grinding in Fabrication - Short Run Pro
Metal grinding is a process that is used extensively in metal fabrication. Metal grinding is most often a manual operation at job shops while large custom parts fabricators will automate through the use of finishing machines. Metal Grinding is used to finish off rough edges, deburr metal parts, smooth welds, create sharp edges and sometimes
