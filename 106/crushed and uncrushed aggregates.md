## Aggregate Sizing Explained - Chaney Enterprises
Fine aggregate, such as concrete or masonry sand is defined as material that mostly passes through a 4.75 mm IS sieve. This is then broken down into four types of grading Zones 1 through Zone 4 with Zone 4 being the most fine.

Relevant to mention: uncrushed aggregate is cheaper than crushed aggregate. Consequently, concrete with uncrushed aggregates will be cheaper. It can be concluded that uncrushed aggregates are appropriate for medium grade concrete for better performance in terms of workability, strength and economy.

ACI 318-05 and -08 does not appear to reward the designer for specifying crushed aggregate over rounded (usually "river rock") in structural concrete. Chapter 4 refers to ASTM C33, and leaves it at that. Certainly crushed rock has better interlock, and must have better shear friction for roughened surfaces.
