## replacement of sand by quarry dust
Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M 20.

## Behaviour of Paver Blocks With Partial Replacement of Sand Using Quarry 
The reduction in the sources of natural sand has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregate in the production of Paver Blocks. Quarry dust, a by-product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials. Granite fines or rock dust is a by-product obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust.

## Replacement Of Sand With Quarry Dust In Concrete Production
This research concludes that at the 25% replacement of the washed sample, was found to give a higher strength than that of the control mix as it approaches 14, 28 and 60 days of curing. A partial replacement of 25% gives the highest compressive strength. And according to the result, it meets up with the target strength of the control mix (MIS).

Sand is one of the important part in construction. The mining of sand also causes environmental problems which can affect the habitats and environment. The demand of sand makes the problem become very worst. To overcome this problem, partial replacement of sand can be done to reduce the amount of sand. In many country, quarry dust may become as the alternative choice to replace the sand.

## Sand or gravel under concrete slabmikmiedzyrzecz.pl
Allow about a third as much in cubic volume for sand as you buy of gravel . For 1.5 cubic yards of gravel, get about one-half cubic yards of sand . Brick pavers are most often 4-by-8 inches. This works out to 4.5 bricks per square foot, so you'll need about 540 bricks for a 120-square foot patio.

## Behaviour of Paver Blocks With Partial Replacement of Sand Using Quarry 
This present work is an attempt to use quarry dust as a Partial replacement of sand in concrete. Using this, reduction of cost and safe disposal of material is achieved. The experimental investigations were carried out by replacing sand with quarry dust in various percentage as 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%.
