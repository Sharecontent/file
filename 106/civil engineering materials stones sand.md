How to calculate materials for different-ratio concrete. When we mix cement, sand and stone chips at 1:15:3 ratio, the concrete strength of 28 days cube test's result comes around 3500 psi If we mix cement, sand and brick chips at 1:2:4 ratio the 28 days cube test result will come around 3000 psi, which is referred for slab concrete I will estimate materials,

Romans made a revolution in the civil engineering world by inventing the "Roman Concrete". Until the discovery of Portland cement in the 19th century, it was the strongest and best building material (11). Roman concrete was primarily "pit sand", which is a form of grained volcanic sand combined with limestone (11).

Sand may be obtained artificially by crushing hard stones. Usually artificial sand is obtained as a by-product while crushing stones to get jelly (coarse aggregate). Sand is used in mortar and concrete for the following purpose: 1. It sub-divides the paste of binding material into thin films and allows it to adhere and spread. 2.

## What are the Uses of Sand in Civil Engineering?
Here are some types of sand that are commonly used as a building construction material. 1. Concrete sand. Sand is the sand most widely used as a building material such as casting, wall plastering, foundations, brick and stone installation. This black sand has a very fine texture, if it is clenched by hand it doesn't clump and it will disperse.

Composition & Types of Sand. Sand is a mixture of small grains of rock and granular materials which is mainly defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. And ranging in size from 0.06 mm to 2 mm. Particles which are larger than 0. mm but smaller than 0.0625 mm are termed silt. Sand is made by erosion or broken pebbles
