## Jaw Crusher: Range, Working Principle, Application - DSMAC
Jaw Crusher Working Principle. A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws, one jaw being fixed and the other being moved back and forth relative to it by a cam or pitman mechanism. The jaws are farther apart at the top than at the bottom, forming a tapered chute so that the material is crushed progressively smaller and smaller

## Jaw crusher working principle and characteristics
Jaw crusher works When the jaw crusher is working, the movable jaws make periodic reciprocating motions to the fixed jaws, sometimes approaching and sometimes leaving. When approaching, the material is crushed, split, and impacted between the jaws; when it is removed, the broken material is discharged from the discharge opening by gravity.

## How Does a Jaw Crusher Work | Jaw Crusher | Kemper Equipment
Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart. The benefit that cone crushers offer over jaw crushers is their ability to output a more cubical product similar to impact crushers. Cone crushers have traditionally been used as secondary and sometimes tertiary crushing

A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
