An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

Introduction to Ore Deposits: Minerals form chief source of all the industrial metals and non-metals. The commonly used metals like aluminum, copper, iron, lead, zinc etc. are all manufactured using minerals as raw materials. Similarly non-metals like glass and refractories are also made from minerals. Minerals are also source of energy.

Verified. Hint: Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite, hematite, goethite, limonite or siderite. Bauxite is a rock formed from a reddish clay material called laterite soil.

Properties of pig iron. Pig iron is also known as crude iron. It is obtained from a smelting furnace in the form of oblong blocks and has a very high carbon content of 3.5 - 4.5 as it contains 90% of iron. It is produced by smelting iron ore with high-carbon fuel and reductant such as, coke usually with limestone which serves flux.

## Iron Ore Distribution in India | Types of Iron Ore - PMF IAS
Iron Ore in Karnataka. Iron ores are widely distributed. High grade ore deposits are those of Kemmangundi in Bababudan hills of Chikmagalur district and Sandur and Hospet in Bellary [Lot of Mining Mafia]. Most of the ores are high grade haematite and magnetite. Iron Ore in other states. Andhra Pradesh (1.02%): Kurnool, Guntur, Cuddapah
