Coal mining is the method of removing coal from the earth is charcoal mining. Coal is prized for its energy quality, and has been commonly used for electricity production since the 1880s. The steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for iron extraction from iron ore and for the manufacture of cement.

In the last decade, more than 300 coal-fired power plants have retired, eliminating coal-related jobs in the power sector. The decline has decimated local economies that relied on associated tax revenue like Boone County, W.Va., which used to draw a surplus of money from a state tax on coal companies.
