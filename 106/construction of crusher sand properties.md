The slump of crushed sand is smaller than the slump of reverse sand. It does not include aquatic material. The bulk density of crushed sand is 1.75 g/cm 3. The basic gravity of the crushed sand is 2.5 to 2.9 which varies on the parent rock. There is no need to correct bulking during the mixing design by using Crushed Sand in concrete.
