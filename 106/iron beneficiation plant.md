Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites, stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practice.This also applies to iron ores of the non-magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation. All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500

## Wet beneficiation of low grade iron ores, or tailings of 35-54% Fe 
The efficiency of iron recovery is 90-95% (as against 70-75% in the conventional beneficiation plants) & the left-over Fe in the tailings is only 10-15% (as against 35-45% in the conventional beneficiation plants). In the process, low grade iron ores are dry-ground, preferably to their liberation size & passed through a fluidized bed roaster.
