The occurrence and mining conditions of underground coal seams become more complex with increasing mining depth, making mining gas extraction more and more problematic (Chen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021a, b).Gas extraction efficiency directly depends on the coal seam permeability, which, in turn, is controlled by several internal factors (such as coal strength, stress loading-unloading
