Heat generated in the grinding process causes gypsum (CaSO 4.2H 2 O) to lose water, forming bassanite (CaSO 4.0.2-0.7H 2 O) or γ-anhydrite (CaSO 4.~0.05H 2 O).  Cement milling is the largest user of electric power on a cement plant, and because they can easily be started and stopped, it often pays to operate cement mills only during "off
