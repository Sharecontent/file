## How Magnets Work? | Stanford Magnets
The working principle of a permanent magnet is related to its atomic structure. Most materials are composed of molecules, molecules are composed of atoms, and atoms are composed of nuclei and electrons. Inside the atom, electrons keep spinning and rotate around the nucleus. Both of these movements of electrons can produce magnetism.

Conclusion. Copper-based pans will not work on an induction cooktop as they are not ferromagnetic. A good option is to clad it with a ferromagnetic metal like stainless steel so the magnetic conduction can take place.

## How Does a Magnetic Locator Work? - Metro Metal Detectors
A magnetic locator uses two sensors along its length to measure the earth's magnetic field. If the measurement is the same to both sensors, the locator emits a low hum. If the measurement differs between sensors, this indicates that a buried magnetic object is in the ground. The locator will emit an increasingly high-pitched tone as it nears

## Magnetic Encoders | Dynapar
Magnetic encoders are a type of rotary encoder that use sensors to identify changes in magnetic fields from a rotating magnetized wheel or ring. A series of magnetic poles around the circumference of the wheel or ring. As the wheel or ring spins past the magnetic sensor, the poles cause a predictable response in the sensor based on the strength
