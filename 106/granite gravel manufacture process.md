When a block arrives from the quarry, it goes to the saw plant. The cutting process is entirely automated; using two gantry diamond saws, each with a diameter of 11.5'. These saws run around the clock, supplemented by a diamond wire saw which allows for cutting taller blocks. On average, it takes 8 - 10 hours to saw through a single block.

## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
4 days agoTaking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

## The processing of granite: Step by step - CKP
Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth¬¥s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

Polishers grind down the naturally rough surface of the stone to whatever finish the consumer desires. Hard stones like marble and granite can be polished all the way to a mirror finish. The polisher consists of rotating pads which are surfaced with an abrasive substance. The finer and smaller the abrasive grits are, the higher the polish.
