When a block arrives from the quarry, it goes to the saw plant. The cutting process is entirely automated; using two gantry diamond saws, each with a diameter of 11.5'. These saws run around the clock, supplemented by a diamond wire saw which allows for cutting taller blocks. On average, it takes 8 - 10 hours to saw through a single block.

## 6 Granite Crushers to Maximize Granite Crushing Efficiency
4 days agoTaking the granite sand production line as an example, the crushing process is as follows: 1. Coarse (primary) crushing: Bulky granite stones are evenly fed into the jaw crusher by the vibrating feeder. 2. Secondary crushing: The coarsely crushed granite stone is sent to the cone crusher by the belt conveyor. 3.

## The processing of granite: Step by step - CKP
Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

## How Are Granite and Marble Countertops Made? | Marble
Polishers grind down the naturally rough surface of the stone to whatever finish the consumer desires. Hard stones like marble and granite can be polished all the way to a mirror finish. The polisher consists of rotating pads which are surfaced with an abrasive substance. The finer and smaller the abrasive grits are, the higher the polish.
