The primary use of iron ore is in the production of iron. Most of the iron produced is then used to make steel. Steel is used to make automobiles, locomotives, ships, beams used in buildings, furniture, paper clips, tools, reinforcing rods for concrete, bicycles, and thousands of other items. It is the most-used metal by both tonnage and purpose.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

May 25, 2021The following is a summary of the common iron ore beneficiation technology: 1.Magnetic separation of ore (1)single magnetite Most of the iron minerals in single magnetite are magnetite. This type of ore has the longest history of beneficiation. Because of the simple composition of the ore, weak magnetic separation methods are often used.
