## Why Choose Dry Process From Manufacturing Cement Methods
Dry process cement production kiln is the typical kiln type during the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. It is a big step for haft kiln. Because of its less than 1% water content dust raw materials, it reduces the most needed heat for evaporating water. So, it needs less time than wet process cement production.

## How Is Cement Produced in Cement Plants | Cement Making Process
The making process of portland cement in the modern industry can be divided into the wet process, dry process, and semi-dry process. Nowadays, the dry process is the most popular cement making process which is widely adopted by cement plants all over the world for its great advantages in energy saving and environmental protection.

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ‚Å∞C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

## What Are the Differences Between the Wet and Dry Processes of a Cement 
The wet process of cement manufacturing involves adding water to finely crushed raw material, such as limestone, clay or iron ore, in a proportion of 35 to 50 percent water to 50 to 65 percent raw material to make a slurry that is fed into a cement kiln, whereas no water is added in the dry process. Instead, the raw material is fed into the kiln in its dry state.
