## Sulphide Ore Extraction [XQFURW]
The concentrated copper sulphide ore is roasted in air when a part of copper sulphide is oxidized to copper oxide Sulfide minerals are one of the most important sources of metal values The present invention is a process to recover precious metals from sulfide ores Barite production data has been recorded from 1872 to present At about 25 to 30%
