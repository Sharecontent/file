So this aggregate was not strong. 4 CONCLUSION. The ACV value is more than 45% for aggregate used for concrete for non- wearing surface and less than 25% for wearing surface like runways and roadways. The higher the aggregate crushing value, the lower the resistance to crushing under the gradually applied compressive load. 5 REFERENCES

In road construction, the quality of aggregates is assessed by the crushing strength of aggregates.For higher quality of roads, the aggregate should possess low aggregate crushing value. Here I am going to teach you how to determine the crushing strength of aggregates.First, let us check what are the various apparatus needed for this experiment.
