## Separation of manganese from iron in sedimentary processes
Selective oxidation and precipitation by different species of bacteria can lead to partial separation of the metals, but this is probably not a major factor in the formation of large, nearly pure deposits of manganese or iron compounds.

This ensures that the iron and manganese stays in a soluble form. If the water contains less than 1.0 mg/L iron and less than 0.3 mg/L manganese, using polyphosphates followed by chlorination can be an effective and inexpensive method for mitigating iron and manganese problems. No sludge is generated in this method.
