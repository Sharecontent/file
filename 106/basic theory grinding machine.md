## Difference Between Machining and Grinding
The maximum cutting speed (rpm) used in conventional machining is typically limited to 2000 rpm (limited by the capability of machine tool, especially gears and bearings). Thus cutting velocity (m/min) is also lower. Rotational speed of grinding wheel is much higher (2000 - 4000 rpm).

## What Is Grinding and Its Working Principle and Type?
Grinding uses extremely fine micronized abrasives, and the machine tool, grinding tool, and workpiece are in an elastic floating working state. Under the action of low speed and low pressure, the convex points of the processed surface are successively ground, and the processing accuracy can reach 0. 1μm～0.01μm.

## Basic Theory Grinding Machine
Basic Theory Grinding Machine. Aluminum oxide grinding wheel is commonly used in making the grinding wheel and will be best suited for grinding the ferrous metals having high tensile strength e.g. hard steel, wrought iron etc. Silicon carbide grinding wheel is used to grind the softer, low tensile strength, high density and non-ferrous materials such as brass, aluminum and softer bronze.

Lathe machine is probably the oldest machine tool know to mankind. Its first use date back to 1300 BC in Egypt. The first lathe was a simple Lathe which is now called a two-person lathe. In this one person would turn the wood workpiece using rope and the other person would shape the workpiece using a sharp tool.

Grinding Theory. Two of the pioneers of modern grinding theory were Richard P. Lindsay from the Norton Company and Robert S. Hahn from the Heald Machine Company, who authored The Principles of Grinding in 1971. Their work took a scientific approach to metal removal during the grinding process to calculate volumetric metal removal rates.
