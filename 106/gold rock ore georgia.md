## How to Test Your Rock For Gold - 7 Simple Methods
Fill it up about halfway and then place the rock in the water (assuming it's small enough to do so). You can measure how big the rock is by how much water is displaced. If the water line moves up 3/4 of a cup then that's how big the rock is. You can use Google to convert that volume to cubic centimeters.

## Here Is The Correct Way To Effectively Recognize Gold Ore
It is possible to detect gold with a specially designated metal detector. A prospecting detector can find gold as small as a half a grain. As the size of the gold becomes larger, gold nuggets can be located at deeper depths. A single grain nugget can be found at a depth of 1-2 inches.

Gold ore is probably one of the most commonly misidentified minerals of all. I probably get at least 2 emails every week from someone asking if they have found gold, but 99.9% of the time, the gold rock that they have found is not actually gold. An important thing to understand about most gold ore is that it isn't shiny at all.
