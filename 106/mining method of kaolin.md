How is kaolinite mined? Deposits of kaolin are located by drilling holes in the earth, which can range up to 200 feet in depth. When kaolin deposits are encountered, core samples of the deposits are extracted and sent to a laboratory for testing.  Once mined, the crude kaolin is hauled to a stockpile, where the processing journey begins.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth.
