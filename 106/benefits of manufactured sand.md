## Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand (M-Sand) - Pros an Cons
Cons: 1. Large portions of micro fines: M-sand has a large amount of micro-fine content compared to natural sand due to the sand production process. This affects the strength of building concrete. 2. The technology used: Use of modern and more advanced equipment is needed in order to produce quality sand.
