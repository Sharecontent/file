Cement, water, and a variety of aggregates go into the creation of concrete, some of which, like limestone, are used in the production of quick-mix concrete. If limestone is heated to a high temperature, concrete will crack and crumble. Quartz aggregate, on the other hand, is used in various forms of concrete and is more durable than limestone.

In limestones, the higher the calcium carbonate content, the whiter the limestone.

Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.

A strong base is a key to a sturdy, long lasting fire pit. Especially one that will use stacked stone to create its walls. For our base, we use inexpensive limestone screenings. They can usually be found at a quarry, or small gravel or sand lot locations as well. At around $7 to $10 a ton, a small pick-up load usually runs around $4.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea. The gravel base is flexible and will move ever so slightly during freeze-thaw.

## Pea Gravel Mix| Concrete Construction Magazine
A.: Richard Meininger replied that there is no problem designing a concrete mixture with 3/8-inch maximum size coarse aggregate (pea gravel or crushed stone) using the ACI 211 proportioning procedures for a concrete slab placed by pumping. But the concrete will shrink more than a No. 57 mixture, so control joints must be at a closer spacing
