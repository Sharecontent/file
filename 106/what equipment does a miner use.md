## How To Use PoE To Power Your Helium Hotspot - Gristle King
First, P-O-E stands for Power Over Ethernet. It's a way to combine BOTH the power AND the Ethernet connection into one cable. You're literally running power over an ethernet cable. When deciding to use PoE, check to see if your hotspot supports it natively like the Nebra Outdoor (Option 1, below) or doesn't (Option 2.)

## How does miner's lamp management use RFID technology
Applying RFID system to mine has proved to be a severe challenge. Initially, 125 kHz low frequency and 13.56 MHz high frequency passive labels were used to customize the (mining) cap lamp battery box. A reader (transponder) is installed in the equipment distribution room and near the turnstile at the exit from the miner's lamp room to the shaft.

## Energy Use in the Mining Industry - The World Counts
The mining industry accounts for 10 percent of world energy consumption. Mining consumes gigantic amounts of energy. The energy consumption of the world's mining industry corresponds to 80 percent of the world's electricity use. Or the total energy consumption of Australia, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Canada.
