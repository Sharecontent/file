Jun 21, 2022Introduction to Rare earth elements. The global demand for rare earth elements is growing. Australia is the 4 th largest producer of rare earths in the world, and it holds 3.4% of the worlds rare earth resources. As critical minerals, rare earths elements processing is a new industry, which makes rare earth projects riskier compared to lithium projects which have a well-documented history.
