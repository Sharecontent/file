You only need a few materials to create strong, durable concrete. These ingredients are water, cement, and aggregates. The aggregates — rocks, crushed stone, sand, and other granular materials — are what actually give the concrete the majority of its bulk and strength.

## What is Aggregate And The Different Types of Aggregates
Natural Aggregate. Using natural rocks (such as limestone, granite, basalt, etc.) mined as raw materials, aggregates made by physical crushing are called natural aggregates, such as sand, crushed stone, gravel, etc. It is an important part of concrete and is widely used in urban road engineering, bridges, buildings and other infrastructure fields.

## 3 Reasons Why It's Important To Use Crushed Stone Under Concrete Slabs
Proper Drainage. Because concrete is a very porous material, it will absorb any moisture that it contacts. This can cause pooling. Without crushed stone, pooling water will settle under it and erode your slab. Adding a layer of crushed stone will add proper drainage, as well as create a barrier between your slab and the ground.

## Pros and Cons of Using Crushed Concrete - Komplet America
Permeability. Studies have demonstrated that recycled concrete has higher permeability than natural aggregates. This means that crushed concrete driveways and other projects are more vulnerable to moisture damage and the elements than new asphalt driveways. Water and humidity are more likely to cause rutting or cracks to the crushed concrete
