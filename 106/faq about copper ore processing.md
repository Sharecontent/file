## copper processing | Definition, History, & Facts | Britannica
copper processing, the extraction of copper from its ores and the preparation of copper metal or chemical compounds for use in various products. In its pure form or as an alloy, copper (Cu) is one of the most important metals in society. The pure metal has a face-centred cubic crystal structure, and there is no critical temperature at which this crystal structure changes.

The principal copper ore mineral is chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), which is commonly smelted to yield a matte containing ∼50% copper.In the presence of silica flux, iron is selectively oxidized to a slag. Figure 14 shows a PSD for the Cu-Fe-S-O system at 1 atm SO 2 as a function of temperature (Rosenqvist 1978).Unlike the system for lead, the copper and Cu 2 S melts are nearly immiscible

## Copper Ore - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In most cases, the thin-layer process was used where crushed ores (80% −0.5 in) were stacked in heaps of 3-8 m height after agglomeration and sprayed at flow rates of 6-40 L·hour −1 ·m −2 with 15-90 days duration for copper oxides and 10-18 months for sulfides. Of note, 80%-85% copper extraction was commonly achieved.
