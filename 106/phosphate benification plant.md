## The beneficiation of ultrafine phosphate - ScienceDirect
Introduction. Phosphate beneficiation operations around the world which use flotation as the principal mechanism to concentrate the phosphate bearing minerals, typically discard the "ultrafine" phosphate bearing particles, where for this study "ultrafine" is defined as particles being smaller than 20 μm.It is standard practice in the phosphate industry to separate the ultrafines by

By Dr. Fathi Habashi. Figure 1—Typical phosphate losses in Florida. Great effort is spent by the phosphate industry to beneficiate the rock to obtain a concentrate containing 30%-31% P 2 O 5 . [1] During this process, much of the phosphate values are lost to the tailings stream. For example, to obtain 1 ton of rock containing 31% P 2 O 5

## Chemical Processing of Phosphate - Florida Poly
Chemical Processing of Phosphate. The phosphate mineral as it exists in the ground is not soluble and is hard for the plant to access. To provide the plant with the phosphate it needs, in a form it can take up through its roots, the phosphate rock is converted to phosphoric acid. It is that acid that is used to make fertilizer.

The phosphate is sent to a chemical processing plant, or fertilizer manufacturing plant. Here, molten sulfur, shipped to Florida ports and trucked to the plant, is used to create sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid is then mixed with the phosphate to make phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is the main ingredient in fertilizer, but can also be
