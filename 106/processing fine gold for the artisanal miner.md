After processing the gold-containing rocks in places called loutra (where rocks are crushed into a fine powder, washed and burnt with acid to remove impurities), miners sell their production in local buying offices. These economic transactions, however, are inscribed in a broader web of social relationships, which define both the miner's and

Most artisanal miners use mercury because it is the cheapest way to separate the gold from the ore. This processing method only allows for 30% of the gold to be extracted, compared with 98% for modern techniques.  Existing artisanal gold supply chains rely on middlemen to aggregate the supply. This dynamic funnels artisanal gold into black

It is estimated that up to 50% of the gold is recovered in the milling process for the benefit of the artisanal miner leaving the remainder in the tailings for the miller.

## Processing centres in artisanal gold mining - ScienceDirect
Abstract. The aim of this paper is to reflect on efforts made worldwide to construct processing centres where artisanal miners can visit to have gold extracted from ore "free" or for a nominal fee. These centres use inefficient grinding and amalgamation processes to extract less than 30% of the gold to give back to the miners.

This process yields an 18-22 karat gold dore that is entirely mercury-free, making it impossible to identify gold produced with mercury once it enters the market place. The Broker/Dealers who purchase uncooked gold are often the same individuals who supply artisanal miners with the mercury needed to produce it.

## The Life of an Artisanal Miner - Sustainable Futures in Africa
By Grace Awosanmi. Artisanal and small scale mining (ASM) accounts for more than 90% of solid mining in Nigeria. The sector is informal and serves as a means of livelihood for more than 2 million people in Nigeria, including women and children. There has been a recent upsurge in workers in this sector as a result of unemployment and poverty.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.
