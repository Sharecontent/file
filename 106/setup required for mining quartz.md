Standard photovoltaic cells require extremely pure polysilicon, which is made from quartz - a mineral comprised of silicon and oxygen (SiO2). Many facets of a photovoltaic cell and its various production processes also use glass made from fused quartz. The stability, transmissivity to light and heat-resistant qualities of quartz have made it
