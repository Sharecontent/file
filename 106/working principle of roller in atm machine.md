## 3 Roll Bending Machine (Working Principle and Rolling Process)
The following is the working principle drawing of symmetrical 3-roll bending machine. Driven roller Ⅱ, Ⅲ is driven by motor and reducer, which rotates in the same direction at the same speed (or in the opposite direction). Because of the friction between the roller and the plate, the plate is driven forward and the roller is rotated.

A wheat milling machine operates with these rollers just millimeters apart, allowing very little room for anything to pass unhindered. The rollers operate at different speeds and spin in opposite directions, pulling anything that passes through them with great force. Bulk grains are fed into these rollers, which make quick work of them.

## The working principle of roll forming machine | TX Machinery
The station roll not only shapes metal but is the main driving force of the machine. The next part of the basic roller forming machine is the cutting press, which cuts the metal to a predetermined length. Because of the speed at which the machine works and the fact that it is a continuous machine, flying die-cutting is not uncommon.

## Hydraulic Press Machine - A Simple Working Principle
The working principle of the press machinery consists of a cylinder having a piston and a piston rod fitted with ring gears. The pressure generated by the rod, in turn, creates a vacuum which is released through ball bearings that are fitted on top of each cylinder. The piece then rotates on the moving cylinder while being pressed.
