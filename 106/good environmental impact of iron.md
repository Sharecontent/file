## What is the environmental impact of Cast Iron? - VR Foundries
With regard to the environmental impact, it must be noted that cast iron does not generally rust as it does not oxidise quickly. This process releases carbon- based iron ashes which does not harm the living environment around. They bring about the growth of plants and raises planktonic life in the ocean, thereby fighting global warming.

Tea drinking accounts for a high proportion of aluminum in the human diet. The levels are safe, but there has been some concern that aluminum traces may be associated with Alzheimer's disease.A 2013 study additionally indicated that some teas contained lead (mostly Chinese) and aluminum (Indian/Sri Lanka blends, China). There is still insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on this subject.

## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.
