The advantages of Rolling process are as follows. By rolling, uniform dimensions of the components can be obtained. It uses the same tool in the sense, the same rollers are responsible for the production of various components. Close tolerance is possible for the components in the rolling. high-speed production takes place in the rolling.

It is known, in metal rolling practice, that the amount of roll force is reduced with a smaller radius of the rolls. Smaller radius rolls, however, deflect easier and must be supported by other rolls. The four high mill uses this principle with two smaller work rolls each supported by a larger backing roll.
