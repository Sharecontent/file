## Heap Leaching - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In heap leaching the ore is usually heaped as it comes from the mine without any breaking on crushing treatment. Frequently, pieces of rock 5 or 6 feet across a face are found in the heaps. Solution is added to the ore at the surface and seeps downward by gravity and is collected in a solution sump.

Heap Leaching Basics. Traditionally, the fine particles would typically go from crushing straight to a heap, where leaching solution would be applied, and the metal would leach out. While this method is effective, its efficiency has been highly increased by the addition of a rotary ore agglomerator after crushing.
