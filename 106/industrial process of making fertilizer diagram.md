## How we make our fertilizer | Yara International
In a modern plant, nitrogen fertilizer is produced from natu­ral gas. In several transformation steps, natural gas, essentially methane, is upgraded by combination with nitrogen from the air to form nitrogen fertilizer. 80% of the gas is used as feed­stock for fertilizer while 20% is used for heating the process and producing electricity.

## Fertilizer manufacturing process | organic & compound & BB fertilizer
For making powdery organic fertilizer, you should dehydrating the raw materials such as chicken manure, cow dung and so on. And then make a compost with compost turners or using the fermentation tank for fermentation. After the fermentation, it's time for you to pulverize the fermented materials into powders.

Conclusion. Phosphate is a key component in sustaining healthy and productive crops. While most phosphate rock goes to the production of MAP and DAP fertilizers, this life-giving mineral can be made into a variety of fertilizer products and blends through the process of granulation. FEECO has been a leader in the fertilizer industry since 1951.
