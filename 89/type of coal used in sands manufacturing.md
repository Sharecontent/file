## Coal Processing Methods
Two new methods of gasifying coal have been proposed by Rummel in Germany. Both processes use a slag bath as a heat transfer medium. In the first, a single shaft gasifier, a mixture of coal, oxygen (or air), and steam is tangentially injected into a bath of molten slag.

Sand casting is divided into: Green Sand Casting: This is a low cost method of casting which does not deliver a very good surface finish. Resin Sand Casting: This casting method is widely used in the automotive industry as it delivers a good surface finish and dimensions. Also visit our Resin Cores for Sand Casting page.
