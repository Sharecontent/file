Another option of reusing copper slag is by using it as a partial replacement of concrete, it will be possible to reuse a waste by-product material beneficially. Large amounts of copper slag can be utilized by using it as fine and coarse aggregates in concrete because more than 75% volume of concrete is occupied by aggregates.

## Copper Slag in Concrete As Replacement Material
Copper slag is an industrial by-product material produced during the process of manufacturing of copper. About 2.2 tonnes of copper slag is generated, for every ton of copper production. The primary objective of this paper is to study the application of copper slag as an alternative replacement material of sand. This paper also studies the effect of replacement of Fine aggregate with copper

## Copper slag
Copper slag is mainly used for surface blast-cleaning. Abrasive blasting is used to clean and shape the surface of metal, stone, concrete and other materials. In this process, a stream of abrasive grains called grit are propelled toward the workpiece. Copper slag is just one of many different materials that may be used as abrasive grit.
