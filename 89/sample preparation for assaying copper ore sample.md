It should be noted that one meter of core sample is ~5000 gr and half of that (~2500 gr) is sent to the lab for analysis. The ~2500 gr sample (half core) is ground and homogenized, and only a 1 gr sample is actually analyzed. The analyzed portion (≤1 gr, or ~0.04% of the half core), theoretically represents the 2500 gr sample. Application
