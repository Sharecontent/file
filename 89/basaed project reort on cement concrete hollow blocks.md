##  Project Profile on Cement Concrete Hollow Blocks
Cement concrete hollow blocks are usually of the following three dimensions: 100X200X400 mm, 150X200X400 mm and 200X200X400 mm. Although hollow blocks of all the three sizes could be made using the same machinery and equipment proposed in the project, for computation purpose only one size viz 100X200X400 mm is considered in the sales turnover.

Suitable for casting common concrete blocks and different size hollow blocks. Operator's access right up to the moulds helps in easy placement of the mix in casting blocks and screeding of concrete mix in the moulds while casting hollow concrete blocks. Power required: 2.2 KW. It doesnt use pallets, just lays the blocks on a flat surfaces.

## Fast Facts: Concrete Hollow Blocks vs Poured Concrete
The walls are built by stacking concrete hollow blocks on top of one another and joined by cement-based mortar. Some more concrete are then poured to fill the voices of the blocks. The second option is to use poured concrete walls. They are built by pouring concrete in a semi-fluid state into pre-built forms.
