Cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct of refining zinc metal from sulfide ore concentrates. It is also produced as a byproduct of beneficiating and refining lead ores or complex copper-zinc ores. Cadmium minerals are not found alone in commercially viable deposits. Greenockite (CdS) is the only cadmium mineral of importance.

In its pure form, cadmium is a silvery white, malleable metal with a bluish hue. It is found naturally in the earth's crust and is a relatively rare metal, ranking 67th in abundance among the 90 naturally occurring elements on Earth. Cadmium is odorless and tasteless, and chemical analysis is most often required to detect its presence.

But it accumulates in the body, and so on average we store about 50 milligrams.

## Cadmium - Element information, properties and uses | Periodic Table
Cadmium sits right below zinc on the periodic table and therefore shares many of its same chemical properties. In the environment it is distributed nearly everywhere we find zinc and therefore when we mine zinc, we consequently mine cadmium. When we galvanize (zinc treat) a nail or some other bit of steel, a little cadmium comes along for the ride.
