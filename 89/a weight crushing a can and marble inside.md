## Natural stone strength (compression, bending, and abrasion) test
Basically, stone testing calculates the fitness of a particular stone for a specific application. As far as the potency of the stone is concerned, testing lets you know more about the ability of the stone to resist bending and crushing. The density and gravity test decides the ability of the stone to carry the weight of the stone.
