## Why is Dolomitic Limestone better - Pattison Company
What is Dolomitic Limestone. Dolomitic Limestone has been around for a very long time and has gone through many name changes over the years. Dolomitic Limestone was originally known as "Magnesium Limestone," as it contains high levels of magnesium instead of just calcium. So just about anyone who can use magnesium should be interested in it.

Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

## Limestone VS Dolomite
Jul 20, 2022Dolomite and limestone are very similar rocks. They share the same color ranges of white-to-gray and white-to-light brown (although other colors such as red, green, and black are possible). They are approximately the same hardness, and they are both soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. They are both crushed and cut for use as construction

## Limestone vs Dolostone: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
For one thing, limestone is a calcium carbonate material while dolomite is made of calcium magnesium carbonate. There are things found in limestone that are not found in dolostone such as clay, sand, and silt. Limestone costs more money to purchase than dolomite because it costs more to mine it or create it. Also, limestone is basically made up

## What Kind of Lime Is Best for Ponds? [Pros & Cons]
Dolomitic lime has high levels of magnesium and may contain traces of other elements too, as it is rarely mined in its pure form.  Crushed agricultural limestone is widely regarded as the best lime to use in ponds, but its poor solubility in water with a pH above 8.3 or alkalinity levels above 50 mg/L may render it ineffective and insoluble

Therefore dolomite limestone (crushed to form pulvertized and pelletized products) is NOT pure CaCO3. If I am correct, in both calcitite and dolomite limestone I still think there is more CaCO3 than MgCO3 (think ratio or fraction), but that in dolomite the fraction of CaCO3 is smaller (vs calcitic) and the fraction of MgCO3 is larger (vs calcitic).

Dolomitic Lime (often referred to as dolomite) is slightly different from agricultural lime. This particular material is manufactured by way of crushing dolomitic limestone into fine particulate matter. Because it is a type of limestone, you can count on the fact that it will also contain a very high calcium content.

Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.
