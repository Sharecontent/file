## How Does Quartz Form? - International Gem Society
Most quartz forms in either igneous rocks or environments with geothermal waters. In igneous rocks, quartz forms as magma cools. Like water turning into ice, silicon dioxide will crystallize as it cools. Slow cooling generally allows the crystals to grow larger. Quartz that grows from silica-rich water forms in a similar way.
