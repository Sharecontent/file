## How many hollow blocks of size 30cm times 15cm times class 10  - Vedantu
As the hollow blocks are in the shape of cuboid therefore we will apply the formula of volume of cuboid here to find the volume of one hollow block. Volume of cuboid = l × b × h. Where l = length of cuboid = 30 cm. b = Breadth of cuboid = 15 cm. h = Height of cuboid = 20 cm. Hence volume of one hollow block = 30 cm × 15 cm × 20 cm.

## hollow blocks - NGM Blocks
Hollow Blocks Line NGM Blocks produces highly durable hollow blocks that are ideal for building stable structural walls and help to enhance all types of architectural features. Those blocks are resilient to pressures of up to 13 MPA; the result of a well-balanced, scientifically studied concrete/aggregate ratio mixture of the highest calibre.
