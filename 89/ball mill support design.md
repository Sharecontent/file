You also need a rod mill work index to design a ball mill operating on a coarse feed, above about 4 mm. Q1: You design for a typical percentage of critical speed, usually 75% of critical. Then you iterate the mill diameter using a Morrell C-model or Nordberg equation to get the RPM that corresponds to 75% for that mill diameter.

For both wet and dry ball mills, the ball mill is charged to approximately 33% with balls (range 30-45%). Pulp (crushed ore and water) fills another 15% of the drum's volume so that the total volume of the drum is 50% charged. Pulp is usually 75% solid (crushed ore) and 25% water; pulp is also known as ' slurry '.

Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.
