Oza et al. (2022) further added that marble dust contains dangerous chemicals for workers, adversely affecting health. Despite the environmental concerns raised by marble extraction, it is recognised as a viable raw material used in concrete production. The following section briefly discusses the applicability of marble dust in concrete production.

## How Far Does Quarry Dust Travel - Realonomics
How Far Does Quarry Dust Travel? Research has shown that large dust particles (larger than 30Âµm) will be dispersed within 100m of the source. Intermediate sized particles (10-30Âµm) are likely to travel m. However smaller particles (less than 10Âµm) can travel much further from the source.
