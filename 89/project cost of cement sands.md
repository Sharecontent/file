Cement is a kind of powdery water-hardening inorganic cementitious material, which can be stirred with water to form the slurry and harden in the air, so that sand and stone can be firmly cemented together. It is widely applied to civil construction, water conservancy, national defense, and other projects home and aboard.

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.

Reinforced Concrete. Reinforced concrete is essentially concrete with added reinforcement, usually in the form of steel rods, bars, or meshes. Reinforced concrete is typically high in cost because the steel used alone is quite expensive. The cost of adding reinforcement can start at $.18 per square foot (source).

## Effect of Fineness of Sand on the Cost and Properties of Concrete - NBM&CW
The net cost of Concrete reduces when FM of sand increases. It reduces by about 6.5% for an increase of FM from 2.0 to 3.0. As the fineness modulus of Sand increases, the Cost/Benefit Ratio reduce by a very large factor. This is 29% when FM changes from 2.0 to 3.0. That means we can get large advantage by using concrete having Coarse Sand.
