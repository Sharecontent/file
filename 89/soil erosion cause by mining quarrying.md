## Do quarrying damage the environment?145
What is the negative effects of quarrying? Quarries are bad for the environment in several ways. They abruptly interrupt the continuity of open space, ruining habitats for flora and fauna, cause soil erosion, air and dust pollution, damage to caves, loss of land, and deterioration in water quality.. Is quarrying good for environment? Mining and quarrying can be very destructive to the environment.

Logging and mining. Logging, similar to deforestation, causes soil erosion as it removes the trees protecting the soil from the elements, anchoring it to the ground. Tree roots act to hold the soil together, and their leaves and branches form canopies that prevent the impact of the harsh elements. Image Credit: Rich Carey/Shutterstock.

## Cause and effect of soil erosion-bau-immobilien
Soil erosion decreases soil fertility, which can negatively affect crop yields. It also sends soil-laden water downstream, which can create heavy layers of sediment that prevent streams and rivers from flowing smoothly and can eventually lead to flooding.Once soil erosion occurs, it is more likely to happen again. This is a global problem.  View PDF Red and Blue Cause/Effect. 2022.
