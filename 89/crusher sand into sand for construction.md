The refractory mortar is utilized only to build fire places and shall not be applied on hot faces. Mortar, which is a mixture of water, cement, and sand, has a higher water-to cement ratio than concrete. It has a thicker consistency which makes it a great adhesive and bonding agent for bricks and tiles. Use kaowool or at least something like perlite, shred styrofoam or straw.

## Crushed Sand: Types, Advantages & Disadvantages
As previously said, crushed sand has several properties such as greater durability, better strength, reduced segregation, and permeability, and it is proving to be cost-effective as a construction material in place of river sand. In a subsequent post, we will go over additional technical aspects of produced sand. Section Under Material.
