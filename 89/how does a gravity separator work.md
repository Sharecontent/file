## Vapor-liquid Separation
The simplest separator is the gravity separator. The rule of thumb used to size a gravity separator is that the superficial velocity of vapor at the free surface should be less than 0.3 m/s. When the velocity is greater than this, the carryover increases rapidly. Kataoka, et al. (1981) describe the carryover process in some detail.

The Genius Behind Gravity Separators. You could go back to Galileo dropping two rocks (one heavy and one lighter) from a tower to Newton's confirmation of the theory of gravity to get to the beginning of a particle's terminal velocity.

How Gravity Separation Tables Work. The gravity separation table, or air table, is commonly used to separate particles by weight and density. A separation table can be used for any dry material as it moves on a "fluidized" bed of air across the table.The separator creates eccentric motion and has an adjustable uphill tilt which separates heavier particles from lighter particles.

## How Does a Magnetic Separator Work? An Intro to Magnetic Separation 
Jan 15, 2021A magnetic separator is made up of a powerful magnet that is either placed or suspended from a ceiling or device. If a tabletop magnetic separator is used, materials or mixtures can simply be passed over it. On the other hand, suspended magnetic separators are often hung over the mixture or material to remove magnetically susceptible impurities

Gravity works by using Gluons. Gluons create quantum gravity by interacting with quarks. Therefore, matter must have quarks in order to have a force of gravity and all Baryonic matter have quarks. Thus, all other fundamental particles lack gravity. Electrons, neutrinos, and photons can have mass but not gravity.
