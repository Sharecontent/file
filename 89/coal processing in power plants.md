## Capture of CO2 Emissions from Coal Fired Power Stations
Our Fossil fueled power stations produce the biggest percentage of carbon dioxide gas, emitting it straight to the atmosphere. The CO2 is formed when we burn a fossil fuel, Fuel + Air = Energy + CO2 + H2O. The amount of CO2 produced is proportional to the type of fossil fuel used, Coal -1.00T of CO2/MWh. Oil - 0.75T of CO2/MWh.

## Could the Nation's Coal Plant Sites Help Drive a Clean Energy 
7 days agoAccording to the study, if a large coal plant site is replaced by a nuclear power plant of equivalent size, jobs in the region could increase by more than 650 permanent jobs for the NuScale design example in the case study.. These jobs are spread across the plant, the supply chain supporting the plant, and the community surrounding the plant and most typically come with wages that are about 25
