This process has been operated at Chiba Steelworks, Kawasaki Steel Corporation (currently JFE Steel Corporation) since 1994. In this steelworks, stainless steel is produced by smelting reduction process of chromium ore with hot metal produced at a BF in a specialized converter-type furnace. Stainless steel dust containing Cr and Ni is generated from this smelting process.
