Dolomite-dominated rocks reflect the higher D of the mineral dolomite across all temperatures measured for similarly textured rocks. For example, Threshold marble, which is dominated by calcite, had a room-temperature D of 1.29 mm 2 s -1, but D of dolomitic marble 17-4 was nearly twice that (2.00-2.64 mm 2 s -1 depending on orientation).

Dolomite is a sedimentary rock resulting from limestone and lime mud coming into contact with groundwater that is rich in magnesium. Because of that, the rock is quite similar to limestone in its coloring and composition. Dolomite is also called Dolostone to prevent confusion with the mineral dolomite which is a significant part of the stone

## The Process Of Dolomite Mining: What You Should Know - Metis Steel
Dolomitization is the geological process in which Magnesium ions replace Calcium ions in a mineral called calcite to form carbonate mineral dolomite. It depends on specific conditions which include low Ca: Mg ratio in solution, reactant surface area, the mineralogy of the reactant, and high temperatures.

## Dolomite | Common Minerals - University of Minnesota
Dolomite forms in hydrothermal veins or as a pore-filling mineral in carbonate rocks, and more rarely as an accessory component in igneous pegmatites or altered mafic igneous rocks. By far though, most dolomite occurs in altered sedimentary marine rocks called dolostones or in marbles formed from the metamorphism of dolostone.

More than 50% of the world's hydrocarbon reserves exist within carbonates. These rocks experience sedimentary and diagenetic processes that result in a diverse variety of pore types, thus making property estimation using empirical equations challenging (Arns et al. 2005).Due to the recent interest in Digital Rock Physics (DRP), it is seen as an alternative way of determining rock properties

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.
