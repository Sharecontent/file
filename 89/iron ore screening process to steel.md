## ore screening process to steel
Dec 04, 2016 0183 32 Steel is simply low-carbon iron As such, the steel manufacturing process begins by smelting iron ore Fe 2 O 3 or Fe 3 O 4 in a blast furnace This smelting process melts out and separates iron from the original rock material Iron ore is mixed with coke, a form of very pure coal

## process of screening in iron mining
Iron ore pelletizing . This process generates iron ore filter cake which needs to be pelletized to be used in the steel making process Also during the processing of the ore to about 9 16mm size Drums typically have very high recycle rates so have a screening circuit to screen out undersize and oversize pieces to be put back through the drum .
