Native Africans had been mining gold in the Witwatersrand area since prehistory. When white settlers first found this gold for themselves in 1886, it triggered what would become the Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886. Like the diamond discoveries before, the gold rush caused thousands of foreign expatriates to flock to the region.

What made South African mining viable was a new technique using cyanidation called the MacArthur Forrest process patented in 1887. By 1898 South African gold output had expanded to 118 tons (3.8 million oz), making it the world's leading producer, and after the interruption of the Boer War it soared to 280 tons (9 million oz) by 1913.
