## Mineral Resources -Use, exploitation and conservation, effect of mining 
Possible Solution for decreasing negative impact . To decrease negative impact on the environment without significantly disrupting the supply of minerals.We believe this objective can be attained through a method of mining known as"sustainable mining. Sustainable mining is an effective way to reduce the impact of mining on the environment.

Lithium can be extracted in different ways, depending on the type of the deposit - it is generally done either through solar evaporation of large brine pools or by hard-rock extraction of the ore. In India, alongside the rock mining at Mandya, there is some potential for recovering lithium from the brines of Sambhar and Pachpadra in Rajasthan.Lithium Deposits in the United States.
