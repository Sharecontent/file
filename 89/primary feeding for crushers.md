Always check that the crusher is on level ground with no cross fall or you will get uneven feed, cause uneven wear and potentially damage the crusher. If the crusher is setup on ground that is facing uphill, the feeder will have to work harder to move the material. Flat or a 1-2 degree downhill angle is acceptable. Striker JQ1060 Jaw Crusher.
