Silica.We've determined that one paver cut releases 45 million micrograms of dust into the air. But not all of that dust is silica.Our tests have shown an average silica content in masonry materials of +/- 20%. If 20% of that dust is silica, we can calculate silica by weight: 45,000,000  20% = 9,000,000 micrograms.

## Benefits of Quarry Dust in Construction - North Hills Co. Ltd.
Using quarry dust is environmentally friendly and available. Quarry dust is much more accessible and available than regular sand for construction. Regular sand is mined from the river bed but quarry dust is a by-product of stone chippings and a good replacement for sand. Using quarry dust saves the environment by preventing sand mining.
