## Effects of acids and alkalis on aquatic life - Lenntech
Acid deposition has many harmful ecological effects when the pH of most aquatic systems falls below 6 and especially below 5. Here are some effects of increased acidity on aquatic systems: - As the pH approaches 5, non-desirable species of plankton and mosses may begin to invade, and populations of fish such as smallmouth bass disappear.

Discoloration: If you have high iron levels in your water — usually 0.3 parts per million or more — the water may be a rusty red or brown color. Your water may still be safe to drink, but it will look less appealing. Staining: High concentrations of iron in home water will stain porcelain bathroom fixtures, laundry and dishes.

## How does weathering affect limestone? - Internet Geography
Weathering is the breakdown of rock by physical, chemical or biological processes. Limestone areas are predominantly affected by chemical weathering when rainwater, which contains a weak carbonic acid, reacts with limestone. This causes the limestone to dissolve. Carbon dioxide from the respiration of animals (and ourselves) is one cause of increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Many of Florida's unique habitats are the result of the effects of weathering on the underlying limestone. Rain water becomes mildly acidic when it mixes with decaying surface vegetation. Where the overlaying clay layers are thin or absent, the acidic water dissolves the limestone.

spring, in hydrology, opening at or near the surface of the Earth for the discharge of water from underground sources. A spring is a natural discharge point of subterranean water at the surface of the ground or directly into the bed of a stream, lake, or sea. Water that emerges at the surface without a perceptible current is called a seep.
