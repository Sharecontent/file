## Wirtgen premieres new 'all-rounder' surface miner for open-pit 
Jun 23, 2022The 280 SM(i) is a high-performance surface miner designed for the reliable and selective extraction of primary resources by direct loading, sidecasting or cut-to-ground, Wirtgen says. Raw materials are extracted and crushed in-situ in purest quality in a single operation - without drilling and blasting, and with minimal environmental impact.

## Q&A About All Things Surface Mining, Terrain Levelers & More
Surface mining operators need to evaluate the power to weight ration of a surface excavation machine. Harder rock requires a heavier machine and more horsepower. In addition, the surface excavation machine a machine cuts impacts productivity. Units that cut upward are not able to utilize the weight of the machine which impacts its performance

The cutting drum for the mining of hard rock has a smaller diameter which permits high cutting performance, enabling the machine to be used in quar- ries and rock operations or trench construction. The cutting drum works in up-cut mode: the more favourable angle of approach produces a com- ma-shaped chip that breaks in an upward direction.

## Surface Miners: Evaluation of the Production Rate and Cutting 
The purpose of this research was to evaluate the production rate (PR) and cutting performance of surface miners (SM) based on rock properties and specific energy (SE). We use data from equipment manufacturers and experimental data in this study and propose a new method and equations to determine both the PR and the cutting speed of SM. The unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the rock, its
