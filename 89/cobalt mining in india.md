## Congo, Cobalt, and Consequence - Child Slave Labor News
The prevalence of child slave labor in Congo is devastating. Children are being forced to dig in Cobalt mines after being taken away from school or even their families. Their only reward for their blood, sweat, tears, and ignorance is the infuriatingly low wages of $0.81, $1.02, or $2.04 per day, depending on age and gender.

Tesla is making efforts to look for alternatives to cobalt mining. However, a massive increase in the production of batteries has created a higher demand for the mineral.

## Cobalt Mining: There's Something That the Petrol Companies Don't Want 
This is due to the fact that cobalt is also used in the refinement of crude oil, which is used to make petrol, diesel, kerosene and pretty much any fossil fuel that you can think of. The process is called desulphurisation and cobalt is used to extract sulphur from crude oil (which is a good thing). All crude oils contain up to 2.5% sulphur.
