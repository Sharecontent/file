## quartz | Definition, Types, Uses, & Facts | Britannica
Quartz has great economic importance. Many varieties are gemstones, including amethyst, citrine, smoky quartz, and rose quartz. Sandstone, composed mainly of quartz, is an important building stone.Large amounts of quartz sand (also known as silica sand) are used in the manufacture of glass and ceramics and for foundry molds in metal casting. Crushed quartz is used as an abrasive in sandpaper

## Silica Mining | Processing Equipment | Flow Chart | Cases - JXSC
Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is silicon dioxide (SiO 2). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon.  Crushing processing sandstone sandstone crushing processing technology at

## Characterization of Occupational Exposures to Respirable Silica and 
Crystalline silica quartz was detected on 80% of personal samples collected at demolition and crushing sites (n = 20)  This results could be related to a number of factors: (i) higher silica content in the material being crushed at site C (17.8% compared to 10.2% quartz in the demolished material); (ii) greater physical barriers surrounding
