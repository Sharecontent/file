## Chromatographic separation of copper with an alpha-hydroxyoxime
Two aliphatic alpha-hydroxyoximes have been synthesized and characterized. These reagents are highly selective for the extraction of copper(II) from weakly acidic aqueous solution. A column containing a hydroxyoxime on a solid support effects a quantitative separation of copper(II) from most other m .

Answer (1 of 8): Its good enough for most purposes, but Gigabit Ethernet is 1000 Mbit/sec. USB2 is only 450 Mbit/s. So even at the fundamental hardware level you lose at least half of the Ethernet bandwidth. Then there is the overhead of controlling Ethernet through USB. This will slow it down.

## copper extraction and purification - chemguide
Copper can be extracted from non-sulphide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulphuric acid to produce a very dilute copper (II) sulphate solution. Concentration of the copper (II) sulphate solution by solvent extraction.

## Copper extraction
The average grade of copper ores in the 21st century is below 0.6% copper, with a proportion of economic ore minerals (including copper) being less than 2% of the total volume of the ore rock. A key objective in the metallurgical treatment of any ore is the separation of ore minerals from gangue minerals within the rock.

## How Is Copper Obtained - Realonomics
How Is Copper Obtained? Copper can be extracted from its ore by: Underground: sinking a vertical shaft into the Earth to an appropriate depth and driving horizontal tunnels into the ore. .The ore is treated with dilute sulfuric acid. This trickles slowly through the ore dissolving copper to form copper sulfate.

Separation of Components of a Mixture: Most of the time, the substances we see are not in their purest form. Substances like Minerals, clay, soil, milk, mineral water, ocean, ghee, juice, and other natural substances do not consist of chemical purity. Hence, the substances are split into independent components using several separation techniques.

## Separation of Copper and Iron from Chalcopyrite in Molten Salt
Aug 10, 2022Around 84% of copper is produced from chalcopyrite through pyrometallurgical routes. However, iron is usually separated from copper matter and ends up in slags that produce secondary waste and wastes resources. Herein, molten salt is employed as a medium to separate chalcopyrite-derived copper-iron oxides. First, chalcopyrite was roasted to generate copper-iron oxide in the air. Then copper
