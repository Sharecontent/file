## In a screw conveyor?f
What is the working principle of screw conveyor? When screw conveyor works, the screw shaft rotates, and the material moves forward along the trough bottom of the conveyor under the push of the blade.Because of the gravity of the material and the friction between the material and the groove wall, the material does not rotate with the blade of the screw conveyor.

The pitch of the conveyor screw is the axial distance between two flight crests. The conveyor screw stays in its position and does not move axially as it rotates to move the material across its length.

## Principle Working Of Conveyor
Working principle. when the screw shaft is rotating, due to the gravity of the material and the friction between the materials and the wall, it makes the material moving forward along the conveyor bottom under the push of the blade. it looks like an unrotatable nut does translational movement along the rotating screw.
