## What are the operating failures of belt conveyors caused by the failure 
Jan 22, 2021The main driving parts of the belt conveyor are the conveyor belt, the roller and the idler. The inter-relationship of the various parts affects each other. The failure of any part itself will cause other parts to fail over time, thereby reducing the performance of the conveyor and shortening The life of transmission parts.
