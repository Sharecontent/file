## Mine Ventilation - Ventilation control of dust in coal mines - GRT
Ventilation control of dust in coal mines is important in the different types of underground coal mining such as (1) room and pillar mining, (2) longwall mining and (3) shaft mining. Type (1) is done in an ore deposit where some of the ore is left behind to form columns in the mine that prevents it from collapsing and it is used for coal mining.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.
