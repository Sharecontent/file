## Safe carriage of Iron ore & other iron concentrates in bulk
In the carriage of iron ore, the following precautions should be taken: Iron ores are heavy cargoes which occupy a small area for a large weight, ie they have a low stowage factor (between 0.24­0.80 m3/tonne). It is therefore important that the tanktop has sufficient strength to carry certain iron ores. If a bulk carrier loads a homogeneous

## Simulation to reduce variability in iron ore stockpiles
This paper describes the design and application of a simulation model used to plan iron ore handling procedures and improve quality performance. The model, written in Extend™ [2], has a dynamic graphical interface which has proved helpful both for developing the model and for constructive interaction with managers and operating staff.

Materials and methods. Vallourec's beneficiation plant produces concentrated iron ore lumps and fines in Pau Branco mine [6]. Tailings are composed of both fines (>45 μm) and ultra-fines (<45 μm). Ultra-fines are generated from the de-sliming cycloning of the magnetic concentration process, and fines are the rejects of this process.

1. Campaigning: For metallurgical reasons if there are some ore types that can cause process difficulties if mixed with other ores. The problematic ore might be stockpiled until sufficient inventory allows one to process that ore (i.e. campaign) through the mill. Such stockpiles will only grow as large as the operator allows them to grow.

Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). It almost always consists of iron oxides, the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ). Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.

First, it allows keeping the grade of the plant feed in over 95% of the time within the target range. Second, it enables meeting operational targets on throughput and utilization, since it decouples crushing and ore processing. Overall, it turned out to be financially advantageous to set up the process with a coarse ore stockpile.

Sampling of iron ore is standardised through the international standard ISO 3082: "Iron ores—Sampling and sample preparation procedures". 4 The iron ore industry has improved its conformance to ISO 3082 over  ISO 3082 therefore recommends only to extract samples as the ore is being transported to or from a ship, stockpile, bunker or silo.

There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.

The iron ore stockpile (formerly known as the "ore cutter") is a construct used to store iron blocks. It's required in order to later process these blocks at the stone cutter or stone cutter II into iron ore. It does not have any particular function of its own outside of this. Only 7 blocks of iron can be stored in a stockpile at a time. The one that can be built in the workyard, is important
