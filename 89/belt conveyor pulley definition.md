## Aspects of Belt Conveyor Design - BELT CONVEYORS .1 Definition 
The major points in selection and design of a belt conveyor are: (a) Checking/determining capacity of a conveyor. (b) Calculating maximum belt tension required to convey the load and selection of belt. (c) Selection of driving pulley. (d) Determining motor power. (e) Selection of idlers and its spacing.

Determining the correct size of pulleys should include consideration of ease of access for service. A larger diameter pulley one with a minimum pulley diameter of 600 millimeters (24 inches) would allow adequate space between the carrying and return runs for installation of a tail pulley protection plow and, if necessary, a return belt plow.
