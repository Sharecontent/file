## A whiter smile, a greener environment: cleaning up with China clay
Few people realise how big an area the China clay industry covers in Cornwall or the volumes of minerals it produces. For every tonne of clay quarried, the miners create nine tonnes of waste rock and mica. The clay operations cover 35 square miles. The clay company Imerys has created some of the biggest holes in the ground in Europe.
