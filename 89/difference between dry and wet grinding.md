## Difference Between Dry Ashing and Wet Digestion
The key difference between dry ashing and wet digestion is that in dry ashing process, the sample in a dry state whereas, in wet digestion process, the sample is in an aqueous solution. Ashing techniques are very important in analytical chemistry for the analysis of different samples in order to determine their composition. Ash is an inorganic

## CONCRETE POLISHING WET VS DRY
The wet process of polishing concrete creates a slurry on the surface which is a mixture of the grinding dust and the water. The downside to this is it has to be cleaned up and disposed of as your grinding and polishing. This can slow productivity and create a mess inside finished homes and retail stores. The upside to this is it keeps harmful

## Wet or Dry Polishing? What Is Right For Your Job
Wet has its advantages. Wet grinding and polishing also increase diamond life dramatically on medium-hard to very hard floors and allow for more aggressive grinding. Grinding wet can effectively remove a significant layer of concrete to expose aggregate. It allows the diamonds to cut faster on medium-hard and very hard floors.

## Can wet grinder be used for dry grinding?145
What is difference between wet grinder and dry grinder? The particles ride along in the liquid and are crushed among the grinding media. Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation.
