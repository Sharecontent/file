Benches are cut into the walls of the mine to provide access to progressively deeper ore as upper-level ore is depleted. Copper ore is removed from the mine and transported to beneficiation plants for milling and concentrating. The concentrate is then smelted and refined. Open-pit mining is the primary domestic source of copper. Underground

Abandoned Mine Education. In September of 2007, an all night search ended tragically Sunday morning near Chloride, a small town in northwest Arizona, after two girls, one 13-year-old and one 10-year-old, fell into an abandoned mine shaft. The girls were riding an ATV early Saturday evening when they plunged into the 125-foot-deep mine shaft.

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.

##  BENEFICIATION OF COPPER Et NICKEL ORES
Flowsheet 3.2-General flowsheet for beneficiation of copper ores (1) molybdenum sulphides 97.6%recovery was produced. Use of higher xanthates had slight improvement on the recovery. However, regrinding of the rougher concentrate and cleaning for the recovery of molybdenite had improved the grade of copper to 29.2°%, Cu with 82.2% Cu recovery in it.
