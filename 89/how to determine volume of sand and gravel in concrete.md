## Concrete Mix Ratios (Cement, Sand, Gravel) - StructX
Water/cement ratio theory states that for a given combination of materials and as long as workable consistency is obtained, the strength of concrete at a given age depends on the w/c ratio. The lower the w/c ratio, the higher the concrete strength. All materials used for a design including the water quality should be to a high standard.

Thus, the quantity of cement required for 1 cubic meter of concrete = 0.98/0.1345 = 7.29 bags of cement. The quantities of materials for 1 m3 of concrete production can be calculated as follows: The weight of cement required = 7.29 x 50 = 364.5 kg. Weight of fine aggregate (sand) = 1.5 x 364.5 = 546.75 kg.

Sand Quantity= (sand Part / Concrete Parts) x Concrete Volume. Aggregate Quantity = (sand Part / Concrete Parts) x Concrete Volume. How many yards of concrete do I need for a 24×24 slab? 7.11 yards For example, for a concrete slab that is 24′ X 24′ X 4", simply enter 4 in the Thickness/Depth field, 24 in the Width field, and 24 in the

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand Quantity for Plastering?
Plastering thickness 12 mm = 12/1000 = 0.012m. Volume of cement mortar required = ( Plastering Area x thickness ) = 100 m 2 x 0.012m = 1.2 m 3 (This is wet volume that means we need this much volume of cement mortar after mixing water, So for dry volume, we have to add 30-35% as bulkage of sand, we are using 35% and wastage as 20%)
