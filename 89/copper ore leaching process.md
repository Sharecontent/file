## Management of Copper Heap Leach Projects: A Geologist's Perspective 
Copper production by heap leaching, coupled with solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW), is a well-established technology, with an annual output of about 3.7 million tonnes (Mt) of copper metal. Ores presently amenable to copper heap leaching include copper oxides and secondary copper sulfides.

The Glycine Leaching Process is an environmentally benign hydrometallurgical process that will leach base and precious metal oxide, mixed oxide and sulphide ores.  The technology has been piloted in North America for both copper and gold ores and a demonstration plant built and operated in Costa Rica in early 2000.

## Copper Ore To Copper Process - Tulip Projects
Copper hydrometallurgy is a branch of metallurgy method to extract copper directly from those difficult-to-concentrate copper oxide ore. Traditional copper hydrometallurgy process typically consists of atmospheric leaching, solvent extraction (SX) and electro-winning (EW). It can produce either copper cathode or copper sulphate crystal.

## Copper extraction
All primary sulfide ores of copper sulfides, and most concentrates of secondary copper sulfides (being chalcocite), are subjected to smelting.Some vat leach or pressure leach processes exist to solubilise chalcocite concentrates and produce copper cathode from the resulting leachate solution, but this is a minor part of the market.. Carbonate concentrates are a relatively minor product

## WOA1 - Sulfide ore leaching process - Google Patents
The present invention discloses a new process for leaching sulfide minerals consisting of leaching crushed ore in a vat reactor, wherein the leaching solution is fed with an ORP value close to the upper limit suitable for leaching and the exiting leaching solution leaves the reactor with an ORP above the lower limit suitable for leaching the ore.
