## Conclusions - Losses in the coal supply chain
Intentional losses such as the coal left in the supports for room-and-pillar mining can be substantial, in extreme cases up to 90% of a coal reserve, but typically more like 40%. Possibly the largest source of mass loss in the coal supply chain has to be the preparation plant, removing mineral matter and inert inorganic substances that cannot

Conclusion. Careful examination of publicly available data shows that the United States has much less accessible coal than has oft been stated. Most coal-producing states have reported reserves at existing mines of less than 20 years and plans for future coal mine expansion are uncertain for geologic, economic and legal reasons.
