Conclusions. Carbothermic reduction of a commercial smelter dust resulted in the recovery of 95 pct of copper, over 80 pct of arsenic and antimony, and over 50 pct of bismuth and tin in the combined metallic copper and matte production. Copper recovery improved as the weight ratio of FeO to SiO2 in the slag approached 1.7.

10. The smelter is essentially a large pile of heat-resistant brick that can melt down various types of ore to produce bars of mostly pure metal. The bars can then be used in the construction of certain buildings, or they can simply be sold for a handsome profit. The miner also provides all smelting recipes.

Copper Smelting means that the concentrated ore is heated strongly with silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) and air in a furnace. The major steps in the extraction of copper are. Copper in Chalcopyrite is reduced to copper sulphide. Just like in Blast Furnaces, calcium carbonate is added as a flux to create the slag.

## Copper Smelting - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The major trend in copper smelting and converting is towards improved capture of the SO2 that is evolved from oxidizing CuFeS 2 and other copper sulfide minerals. Improved SO 2 capture benefits the environment and the resulting H 2 SO 4 product can be used for leaching "oxide" and supergene sulfide minerals. The improved SO 2 capture has

## Zambia's Advanced, World-Class Copper Smelter in Action
April 20, 2017. O ne of the newest and most advanced copper smelters in the world is not in China or Canada or the United States, but right here in Zambia. This $900 million marvel of technology, which started operating in early 2015, is situated at First Quantum Minerals' (FQM) Kansanshi Mine in North-Western province, just outside Solwezi.

## Detailed opex comparison of modern copper smelting technologies using 
It is well known that there are many ways to process copper concentrates into copper anodes using the pyrometallurgical route. All modern copper smelting technologies are fundamentally energy efficient and environmentally safe options, so choosing the right one depends on the desired capacity range, feed impurity levels, plant location, flexibility needs, overall energy use, and of course

World Copper Smelter Production, . Smelting is the pyrometallurgical process used to produce copper metal. In 2012, world copper smelter production reached 16.7 million tonnes copper. Recently, the trend to recover copper directly from ores through leaching processes has been on the increase. Primary smelters use mine concentrates as
