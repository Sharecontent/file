## Coal Grinding - Cement Plant Optimization
Coal Grinding. To achieve good combustion and satisfactory flame formation, coal needs to be dried and ground to a proper degree of dryness and fineness. Drying of moisture in coal is achieved normally by ducting part of the kiln exhaust gas through the mill with inlet temperatures of up to 300Â°C. Inert kiln exhaust gases with oxygen content
