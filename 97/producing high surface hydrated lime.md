Specification. Calcium hydroxide is the chemical name for hydrated lime. It is traditionally referred to as slaked lime. Hydrated lime is a colorless crystal or white powder and is obtained once burnt lime (called lime or quicklime) is mixed, or quenched with water. Hydrated lime is also known as caustic lime, builder's lime or pickling lime.

2. Why apply lime ? Lawns need lime when low soil pH starts inhibiting the availability of nutrients. Soil pH preferences vary between regional lawn grasses, but most grasses prefer soil pH between 5.8 and 7.2. Warm-season grasses tolerate slightly lower pH, while cool-season grasses prefer pH slightly higher. 1,2 When within preferred pH ranges.
