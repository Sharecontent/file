## Common hobby foundry questions
Molding sand used for iron casting often uses different clays than the regular fireclay and often has powdered coal added to it which is said to improve the surface quality of the castings. Also the heat of the iron is more likely to turn the silica sand to glass. I'm having trouble with the flowerpot furnace, it's build just as you describe

Ironsand, also known as iron-sand or iron sand, is a type of sand with heavy concentrations of iron.It is typically dark grey or blackish in colour. It is composed mainly of magnetite, Fe 3 O 4, and also contains small amounts of titanium, silica, manganese, calcium and vanadium.. Ironsand has a tendency to heat up in direct sunlight, causing temperatures high enough to cause minor burns.

Use a ratio of 5 parts sand to 1-part coconut fiber. When used together, this mix is superior to a substrate that's coconut fiber or sand alone. Coconut fiber absorbs water well, allowing the substrate to retain moisture. Sand can fill the spaces in coconut fiber, making digging and burrowing significantly easier.
