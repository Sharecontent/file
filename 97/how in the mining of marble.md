## What is marble mineral? - AnswersToAll
What are all of the minerals in marble? In its pure form, marble is a white stone with a crystalline and sugary appearance, consisting of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Usually, marble contains other minerals, including quartz, graphite, pyrite, and iron oxides. These minerals can give marble a pink, brown, gray, green, or variegated coloration.

The Mining of Marble. As a natural stone, marble is both incredibly strong and very delicate. It does not split easily and must be mined carefully in order to get sheets of similar size. Explosives can't be used, because the rock will shatter. Instead, minors outline blocks of marble and drive wedges into grooves' openings.

Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall.". The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.

Marble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, most commonly calcite or dolomite.Marble is typically not foliated (layered), although there are exceptions. In geology, the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone, but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.
