The most common method is to roast gold-bearing minerals at temperatures of 450° to 750° C (840° to 1,380° F) to destroy the interfering sulfides. Oxidation can also be accomplished by the use of high-pressure reactors called autoclaves, in

At current gold prices this is worth about US$600. Both smelter treatment charges and oxidation or bio-leach costs are at least $200/t of concentrate and payables/recovery in the 90% range, so a minimum GSR for effective downstream processing is around 0.5. Clearly this is a function of gold price, but in the current gold price and cost
