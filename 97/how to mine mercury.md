The Legacy of the Mercury Mines. The New Almaden Quicksilver Mines - established in 1847 and named for the world famous mines of Almaden, Spain - were once the richest mercury mines in North America. New Almaden mercury was used in sluice boxes during the California Gold Rush to amalgamate with gold. Between 1850 and 1875, miners extracted a

During the U.S. gold rush, hydraulic mining operations in California completely denuded forested landscapes, altered the course of rivers, increased sedimentation that clogged river beds and lakes and released enormous amounts of mercury onto the landscape.
