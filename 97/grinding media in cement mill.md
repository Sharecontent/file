## Cement Grinding in Ball Mills and Vortex Layer Devices
Grinding cement in ball mills. The principle of the ball mill operation is simple: it consists of a rotating drum and grinding media (cylinders, balls etc). The material is placed into the drum which starts rotating. The grinding media and the substance both come in circular motion and at a certain point drop from the walls the bottom of the drum.
