Mining: Aggregate materials are either used in their natural state or after crushing, washing, and sizing. The materials can be used loosely, or sand, gravel, and crushed stone can be combined with a binding media to form concrete, mortar or asphalt. The mining process begins with the removal of the overburden to reveal the materials underneath.

Limestone is a rock composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). It is the rock type most commonly used to make crushed stone in the United States. It holds this position because it is widely available and suitable for a greater diversity of uses than any other type of rock. Limestone can be used to make cement.
