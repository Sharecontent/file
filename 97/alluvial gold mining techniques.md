Plan for a three-day walk at least and a coach isn't much faster. It was hard work pushing all your belongings and equipment on a heavy wheelbarrow, but unless you had money for transport, it was the only way to get to the goldfields. Step 3. Buy a miners' licence for 30 shillings (about 30 hours' wages), which lasts one month.

## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

The gold wires enclosed lumps of schist and clay from the soil as they grew. Alluvial mining is technically simpler than hard-rock mining, so alluvial mining dominated Otago's gold mining history. Alluvial gold occurs as loose particles in the gravel, and is therefore easy to separate because of the high density of the gold.

Gold is the most vulnerable and pliable metal; a single gram can be packed down into a pane of one square meter, or a bit into 300 square feet. Gold leaf can be flattened thin enough to be converted into semi-transparent. The transmitted luminosity appears greenish blue, for the reason that gold powerfully reflects yellow and red.

The transfer of skills and knowledge of alluvial gold mining took place in the 1950s and 1960s when many residents, especially around the Wau/Bulolo area, applied for and were granted MLs. By the early 1970s, most expatriates who originally held mining leases for small-scale gold mining in the country had transferred their leases to citizens.
