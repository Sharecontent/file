The ball mill is used for the grinding of a wide range of materials, including coal, pigments, and felspar for pottery, and it copes with feed up to about 50 mm in size. The efficiency of grinding increases with the hold-up in the mill, until the voids between the balls are filled. Further increase in the quantity then lowers the efficiency.

8.3.2.2 Ball mills. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11 ). The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

1. Fill the container with small metal balls. Most people prefer to use steel balls, but lead balls and even marbles can be used for your grinding. Use balls with a diameter between ½" (13 mm) and ¾" (19 mm) inside the mill. The number of balls is going to be dependent on the exact size of your drum.

If a ball mill contained only coarse particles, then 100% of the mill grinding volume and power draw would be applied to the grinding of coarse particles. In reality, the mill always contains fines: these fines are present in the ball mill feed and are produced as the particles pass through the mill.
