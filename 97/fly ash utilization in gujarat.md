## What is Fly Ash? Physical and Chemical Properties of Fly Ash
What is Fly Ash? Fly ash, a byproduct from coal-based thermal power plants, is abundantly available in India. Estimates show that more than 100 million tons of fly ash are produced annually from around 83 major coal-based power stations. A small fraction of this is fruitfully utilized. Fly ash is a solid fine-grained material resulting.
