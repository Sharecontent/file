By Cypress Semiconductor 08.17.2011 7. Power Line Communication (PLC) is a communication technology that enables sending data over existing power cables. This means that, with just power cables running to an electronic device (for example) one can both power it up and at the same time control/retrieve data from it in a half-duplex manner.

## How electricity is generated - Energy Information Administration
Most of U.S. and world electricity generation is from electric power plants that use a turbine to drive electricity generators. In a turbine generator, a moving fluid—water, steam, combustion gases, or air—pushes a series of blades mounted on a rotor shaft. The force of the fluid on the blades spins/rotates the rotor shaft of a generator.

## Machine efficiency and man power utilization on the production line 
The production or manufacturing lines in industries can be categories into three type's i.e. automated production lines, semi-automated production lines, and manual production lines. The nature of a production line depends on the complexity of the manufacturing parts, the production volume, the sensitivity of the product and cost.
