## Natural stone strength (compression, bending, and abrasion) test
Strength testing of the natural stone. Basically, stone testing calculates the fitness of a particular stone for a specific application. As far as the potency of the stone is concerned, testing lets you know more about the ability of the stone to resist bending and crushing. The density and gravity test decides the ability of the stone to carry

## When To Use Crushed Stone As Opposed To Gravel - Atak Trucking
As opposed to certain types of gravel, most crushed stone is used as an aggregate for building and construction purposes. It can be used in its raw state without a binder or can be mixed with a binder depending on the end use. The most common uses for the material to be used without a binder are as a road base or sub-base material, shoreline
