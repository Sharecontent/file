Magnetic separation is a process used to separate materials from those that are less or non­magnetic. All materials have a response when placed in a magnetic field, although with most, the effect is too slight to be detected. The few materials that are strongly affected (magnetised) by magnetic fields are known as "Ferromagnetics", those

Gravity separation has been applied to process chrome slag by steel researchers in India. Heavy media separation (Choudhury et al., 1996) and crushing and jigging (Khan et al., 2001) are the principal techniques used. The slag is subjected to 2-stage crushing to reduce the size to −10 mm and then screened into −10 +1 mm and −1 mm fractions.

Flotation. Flotation is a gravity separation process which exploits differences in the surface properties of particles. Gas bubbles are generated in a liquid and become attached to solid particles or immiscible liquid droplets, causing the particles or droplets to rise to the surface. This is used to separate mixtures of solid-solid particles

## Difference between gravity separation and magnetic separation in 4 
Nov 16, 20201. Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.. Gravity separation is an industrial method. It separates two components, either a suspension or dry granular mixture where separating the components with gravity is sufficiently practical. 2. The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non-magnetic material

## Gravity Separation - Oliver Manufacturing - How it works
How Gravity Separation Tables Work. The gravity separation table, or air table, is commonly used to separate particles by weight and density. A separation table can be used for any dry material as it moves on a "fluidized" bed of air across the table.The separator creates eccentric motion and has an adjustable uphill tilt which separates heavier particles from lighter particles.

## Regional gravity anomaly separation using wavelet transform and 
In recent years, the gravity and magnetic method has played an important role in the pre-Cenozoic structure study and oil exploration of residual basins (Liu 2001). Based on the analysis of rock physics properties, the separated regional anomalies induced by the deep geology structures were used in pre-Cenozoic structure inversion (Xu et al 2007 ).
