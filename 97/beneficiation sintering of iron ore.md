## copper smelting pollutants
Fire copper smelting: Cathode copper is produced by melting smelting and electrolytic refining, that is, electrolytic copper, which is generally suitable for high-grade copper sulfide ore. Pyro-smelting generally involves first increasing the raw ore containing a few percent or a few thousandths of copper to 20-30% through beneficiation.

## difference between sinter plant beneficiation
Apr 08, 2020· After beneficiation & sintering / pelletization of iron ore, beneficiation and sintering of manganese ore fines attracted technology experts due to massive expansion in manganese based ferro-alloys. Fast depleting high grade lumpy manganese ore deposits made the beneficiation and sintering all the more wanted solution.

What are steel pellets used for? Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing.The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high-grade natural iron ore in the United States.

What is the difference between pellet and sinter? 2.2.1 Iron content The typical iron (Fe) content of sinter is around 55-58%, while BF pellets are normally 62-66% Fe. BF pellets have a higher Fe content as they are manufactured from low- grade ores that are finely ground prior to undergoing mineral beneficiation treatments.
