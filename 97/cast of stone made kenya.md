## What is wet cast stone & What is dry cast stone? - Premier Precast
There are two common methods of manufacturing cast stone: one is the dry tamp method and the other is the wet cast process. Both of these methods create a simulated natural cut stone look.. The most common finish for a dry tamp cast stone is limestone or sandstone while the wet cast method is capable of providing a wider array of possible finishes.
