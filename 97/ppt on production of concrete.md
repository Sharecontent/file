## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
G. Habert, in Eco-efficient Construction and Building Materials, 2014 10.1 Introduction. Cement production has undergone tremendous developments since its beginnings some 2,000 years ago. While the use of cement in concrete has a very long history (Malinowsky, 1991), the industrial production of cements started in the middle of the 19 th century, first with shaft kilns, which were later

## Concrete Production Process| marstllaroilconcrete
Cement Production. Cement is the binding agent in concrete. It's a mixture of different elements, which include calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. When water is added to it, a chemical reaction is activated. This causes the cement to harden, holding any aggregates in the mixture in place.

## Cement and Concrete: The Environmental Impact â PSCI
The Production Process of Concrete: Concrete is constructed using cement mixed with an aggregate-- a grainy blend of materials such as stone and sand. After mixing, the concrete is poured into a mold and left to harden then use in building. The aggregates are sourced from a local body of water and crushed in a natural procedure.
