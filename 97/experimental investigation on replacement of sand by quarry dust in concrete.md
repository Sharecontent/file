Quarry dust can be used as an economic alternative to the natural sand. In this investigation an attempt is made to utilize quarry dust as a partial substitute for natural sand in producing concrete. Natural sand is replaced by Quarry dust at an interval of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%. Mix proportions for M 20.
