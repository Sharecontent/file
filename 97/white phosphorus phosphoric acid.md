## White phosphorus munitions | Weapons Law Encyclopedia
White phosphorus ignites spontaneously upon exposure to air (it is pyrophoric) at a temperature of around 30-34 degrees Celsius (or lower)  In the reaction of phosphorus pentoxide with water (in the air or in the human body) phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) is formed. WP continues to burn until oxygen supply is cut off or the substance is depleted.

## white phosphorus
The isolation of white phosphorus is usually accomplished by heating a phosphate with sand and carbon in an electric furnace, 1 which is highly energy intensive. White phosphorus does not occur naturally (for obvious reasons - poof.) White phosphorus is used as an ingredient for phosphoric acid, which is highly useful

Here is how it works: You cram 15.6 pounds of white phosphorus inside a 155mm projectile and shoot it over the general target area. The shell explodes, dispersing 116 white phosphorus-coated felt wedges over an area of 250 meters in diameter. Soon as the phosphorus comes in contact with air it starts to burn with up to 1,500 Fahrenheit.

## What is phosphoric acid | uses and rust removal. - FindaTopDoc
What is phosphoric acid? Phosphoric acid is a mineral acid. This means it is an inorganic type of acid. These are derived from one or more inorganic compounds. In the case of phosphoric acid, they are derived from inorganic phosphate rocks. Acid of higher purity can also be made, by using white phosphorus.

## White Phosphorus in Spec Ops: The Line and the Transition of FPS 
Due to its chemical properties, white phosphorus can absorb more phosphoric acid (the acid that causes burns after exposure to the chemical). The way white phosphorus irritates and damages tissues has lead to it being banned from use against civilians, but this law has been overlooked in the past few years, particularly in the Gaza War of 2008

How is phosphate prepared from white phosphorus? Ans: The white allotrope can be produced using several different methods. In the industrial process, phosphate rock is heated in an electric or fuel-fired furnace in the presence of carbon and silica.Elemental phosphorus is then liberated as a vapour and can be collected under phosphoric acid.

For this reason, phosphates are the primary source of elemental phosphorus for chemical process requirements. Only 0.20 to 0.27% phosphate (0.15 to 0.20% as P 2 O 5; 0.07 to 0.09% as P) is present in ordinary crustal rocks, but nevertheless this is the location of the bulk of the phosphorus present in the lithosphere [2].

## white phosphorus: Preparation, Properties, Structure, and uses
Generally, the White phosphorus is called Phosphorus. Phosphorus is a major component of bones and teeth in the form of calcium phosphate.  Phosphorus is used to make some useful chemicals like hypophosphorous acid, phosphorus pentachloride, and Phosphoric Acid. hypophosphorous acid is also used in medicine.

Phosphorus, (IPA: /ˈfɒsfərəs/, Greek: phôs meaning "light", and phoros meaning "bearer"), is the chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol P and atomic number 15. A multivalent nonmetal of the nitrogen group, phosphorus is commonly found in inorganic phosphate rocks and in all living cells.. Phosphorus exists in several allotropes, most commonly white, red and black.

Of the several different types of elemental phosphorus, Brandt produced white phosphorus (WP), which starts to burn upon exposure to air at 30°C (86°F) in moist conditions and at 35-46°C (95-115°F) in dry conditions.  bathing the area in a bicarbonate solution will neutralize any phosphoric acid that may have been produced. Remaining WP
