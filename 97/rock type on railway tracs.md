## Railroad Tracks - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the United States, the total railroad track mileage in 1981 was 327,000. From a survey of US and Canadian Class 1 railroads for 1983, the length of line surveyed was 145,881 which was 69.5% of the total track. This therefore gives for those two countries a total mileage of 209,900 for this class of track.
