Also, like all chemical reactions, temperature has an accelerating effect on the hydration reactions. It should be noted that the time-strength relations in concrete technology generally assume moist-curing conditions and normal temperatures.

In a DR process, iron ore pellets and/or lump iron ores are reduced by a reducing gas to produce DRI or hot briquetted iron (HBI). Depending on the generation of the reducing gas, two different DR processes are commercially available: gas-based and coal/oil-based. In the gas-based DR process, the reducing gas is produced by chemically reforming

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## reduction reaction in tunnel kiln process for iron
reduced iron tunnel kiln Hitlers Hollywood. reduced iron tunnel kiln. By using tunnel kiln to produce DRI is that mix the iron ore concentrate pulverized coal and limestone powder with certain proportion and feed into material drum for being reduction and then put these drums on the kiln car and pushed it into the tunnel kiln when the material drum is heated to 1150℃ for reduction
