They are coming up with new products for concrete to make it more durable, but I just don't think it's there yet. That leaves Quartz surfaces. These products are the closest to natural stone, mainly because they typically are made mostly of quartz. Quartz products consist of 93% quartz, polymer resins and various other natural stone products.
