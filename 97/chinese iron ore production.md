## China iron ore cost summary Report | Wood Mackenzie
Report summary. Our 2021 average total cash cost of Chinese iron ore mines is US$15/tonne higher compared to 2020 due to higher energy costs, strong RMB and higher royalties and levies because of higher iron ore prices in 2021. We expect costs to increase to around US$82/tonne due to higher diesel prices in 2022.
