## New type of crushed sand to replace natural sand in concrete production 
After VSI crushing, the 0/4 mm crushed sand material was further split in two fractions - 2/4 mm and 0/2 mm. Almost 9 tons of the 0/2 mm fractions were then sent to Metso's air-classification laboratory in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, USA, for controlled removal of filler and alteration of filler grading.

## Pros and Cons of Using Crushed Concrete - Komplet America
Permeability. Studies have demonstrated that recycled concrete has higher permeability than natural aggregates. This means that crushed concrete driveways and other projects are more vulnerable to moisture damage and the elements than new asphalt driveways. Water and humidity are more likely to cause rutting or cracks to the crushed concrete
