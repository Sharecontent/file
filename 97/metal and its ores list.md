The basic extraction of metals from ores has the following steps. Grinding and Crushing. The bigger chunks of the ore extracted are crushed and ground in ball mills and crushers. It helps to increase the surface area of the chunks for better chemical actions later. In technical terms, it is called pulverisation.

Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.

## Classical element
e. Classical elements typically refer to water, earth, fire, air and (later) aether, which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances. [1] [2] Ancient cultures in Greece, Tibet and India had similar lists, sometimes referring in local languages to "air" as "wind" and the fifth element as "void".

## What Is Metal Ores - Realonomics
What are mainly metal ores? The best metal ore minerals are those that contain large amounts of metals of value. Most metallic ore minerals are native elements sulfides sulfosalts oxides or hydroxides. Ore deposits are highly variable in nature and origin. The most important kinds of ore deposits are magmatic hydrothermal or sedimentary.

Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.
