## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O â†’ 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

## silver mining chemical
Silver: A native element, mineral, alloy, and byproduct. Most of the silver produced today is a byproduct of mining copper, lead, and zinc. The silver occurs within the ores of these metals in one of two ways: 1) substituting for one of the metal ions within the ore mineral's atomic structure; or, 2) occurring as an inclusion of native silver or a silver .

Silver also occurs alongside lead, copper and zinc ores, which is why nearly 50% of mined Silver today is obtained when processing other kinds of ore. Silver is separated from this ore using a chemical process known as smelting. To begin a new Silver mine, a system of multi-layered crosscuts are made.
