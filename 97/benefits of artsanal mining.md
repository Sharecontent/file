## What Are the Benefits of Mining? - Research Summary
A mining operation must either own the land being mined or secure a contract for the "rights" (the legal right) to mine the land. But being free to mine the land is only the beginning. The mining company must invest in equipment and facilities. Beyond that, the mining company must have one or more buyers for its raw materials.

Mining helps industries to grow by providing raw materials to industries. Many industries obtain their raw materials from the mining sector. For example, building and construction industries get some of their raw materials from processed asbestos and iron ore. Heavy engineering firms obtain iron and steel from the Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company.

## Artisanal mining
An artisanal miner or small-scale miner (ASM) is a subsistence miner who is not officially employed by a mining company, but works independently, mining minerals using their own resources, usually by hand.. Small-scale mining includes enterprises or individuals that employ workers for mining, but generally still using manually-intensive methods, working with hand tools.

## Artisanal and Small-scale Mining (ASM) Formalisation Benefits
Sep 16, 2021The majority of artisanal and small-scale mining activities operate informally, which means they take place illegally without the required licences and permits. Despite the existence of legal frameworks for ASM in many countries around the world, the majority of operations remain unregulated and untaxed. Often, informal activities will have a 'social licence to operate'.
