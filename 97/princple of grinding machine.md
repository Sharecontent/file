4. Principle of the Surface grinding machine â€¢ Surface grinding is used to produce a smooth finish on flat surface. It is a widely used abrasive machining process in which a spinning wheel covered in rough particles cuts chips of metallic or non-metallic substance from a work piece, making a face of it flat or smooth.

## 8 Principles of Centerless Grinding - Metal Cutting Corporation
With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.

## Machining 101: What is Grinding? | Modern Machine Shop
Principles of Grinding. In all forms of grinding, three different interactions occur between the abrasive and the machined material. Cutting occurs where the abrasive grain is sufficiently exposed to penetrate the workpiece material and curl a chip, and sufficient clearance exists between the grain, bond and workpiece to flush the chip with coolant or throw it away by wheel action.

5. The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery. Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds. The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc. Dis advantages are high wear on the grinding medium.
