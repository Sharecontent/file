## Diatomaceous Earth General Fact Sheet - Oregon State University
If breathed in, diatomaceous earth can irritate the nose and nasal passages. If an extremely large amount is inhaled, people may cough and have shortness of breath. On skin, it can cause irritation and dryness. Diatomaceous earth may also irritate the eyes, due to its abrasive nature. Any dust, including silica, can be irritating to the eyes.

Break up any large clumps of earth with the tip of the shovel and smooth out the surface with the rake. Step 2.  The steam roller will further compress and heat the recycled asphalt so it essentially melts together and then sets up to form a hardened surface as durable as new asphalt. Allow the asphalt to cure for at least 24 hours.

## Eliminate Ants With Diatomaceous Earth - Earthworks Health
The short answer is - yes. Diatomaceous earth is very effective at killing ants and other crawling insects. It's so effective, the Canadian government has suggested diatomaceous earth as an alternative to chemical pesticides for ant control. It not only gets the job done, but it's not toxic to humans or pets.
