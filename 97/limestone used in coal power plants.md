## Limestone Used In Coal Power Plants
, the flue exhaust gases from a coal-fired power plant are commonly led through a spray of limestone slurry in a so-called scrubber. The resultant reaction typically captures 90% or more of the SO 2. Approximately 80-85% of worldwide FGD units installed in power plants use wet limestone scrubbing vs. other technologies.

## Flue-gas desulfurization
As explained above, alkaline sorbents are used for scrubbing flue gases to remove SO 2. Depending on the application, the two most important are lime and sodium hydroxide (also known as caustic soda). Lime is typically used on large coal- or oil-fired boilers as found in power plants, as it is very much less expensive than caustic soda.

## Is limestone used in coal mines? - Origin of coal
The major disadvantage of coal is its negative impact on the environment. Coal-burning energy plants are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to carbon monoxide and heavy metals like mercury, the use of coal releases sulfur dioxide, a harmful substance linked to acid rain.
