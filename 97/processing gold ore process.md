## Gold Refining Step by Step Process: A Useful Discussion
Dec 1, 2020Further processing is needed to receive pure gold. The first step is to crush the parent rock. Next, the pieces go through multiple processes. It depends on the types of minerals and materials combined with the respective gold ore. The goal of these steps is to extract the gold from all these elements.

## gold processing - Mining and concentrating | Britannica
The nature of the ore deposit determines the mining and mineral processing techniques applied. Oxide ore deposits are frequently of such low grade (e.g., 3 to 10 parts per million) that extensive mineral processing cannot economically be justified. In this case they are merely shattered by explosives and then piled into heaps for extraction by cyanidation (see below).

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.
