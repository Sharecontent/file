## The lives of coal miners in the early 20th century | Britannica
Over the years, there have been many improvements in the mining industry. Women now work alongside men, and, though still dangerous, the work isn't as deadly as it used to be. In 1917, 2,696 coal mining deaths were recorded. In 2017, the number was 15. Despite that progress, though, mining is still very hard work.

## Why Coal Mining Is Bad - Realonomics
Why Coal Mining Is Bad? Coal mining releases toxic materials into the soil and water. Bad mining can start coal fires which can burn for decades - releasing "fly ash" and smoke filled with greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals. It releases coal mine methane which is 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.

## SPECIAL REPORT: Why is mining still so dangerous?
But this inherent danger, and the relentless drumbeat of death, induces a fatalism, and is an obstacle to attempts to make mining safer. Miners are expected to accept that dying at work is part of the job. And those who do make it to the surface face a host of diseases and injuries. Silicosis. Black lung.
