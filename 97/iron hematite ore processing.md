Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## Iron Ores (Hematite and Magnetite) - GeeksforGeeks
Nov 9, 2021An ore is a mineral deposit that contains a metal that can be extracted using existing technological methods. Iron can be extracted from two types of iron ores: Magnetite and hematite. Magnetite is composed of iron in the form of Fe 3 O 4. Hematite is a mineral that contains iron in the form of Fe 2 O 3.

The minerals that are mostly used as ore for making iron are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ). Iron is quite soft and easily worked, but it has a very high melting point of 1538°C. Iron and some alloys of iron are also magnetic. Hematite and hematite powder on streak plate. Source: Geoscience Australia.

Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content. However, hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus, alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.

## Hematite and magnetite are important ore minerals of ________ found in
Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world. Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.
