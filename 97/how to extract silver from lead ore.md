The lead and other impurities are absorbed into the bone ash, and the molten silver is drawn off. Silver is extracted from lead ores in large furnaces, a process called cupellation. Most silver is extracted from ores with a froth flotation process, which was discovered early in the 20 th century. In this process, crushed ore is placed in a bath.

Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.

## extracting silver from lead ore
The Romans very quickly began extracting silver from lead ore around Britain after their conquest in the first century AD, and German mines became the primary source of silver in medieval times. Today, Europe still produces 17% of new silver in the world and recycles 37% of the worlds silver.
