## Forged vs. Cast Irons: Which is Best for Your Golf Game?
The difference between forged and cast irons is the way that they are manufactured. A forged iron is made from one piece of steel. However, the steel is then heated and worked on to shape into a proper club head. The cast irons are made from a mold. Essentially steel is heated to a liquid material, poured into a mold, and then allowed to

## What is Cast Iron?- Definition, Properties, and Uses
What is Cast Iron? Cast iron is a group of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content of more than 2 to 4 percent. In addition, varying amounts of silicon from 1 to 3% by weight and manganese as well as traces of impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus. Cast iron is made by reducing Iron Ore in a Blast Furnace.

## Cast iron
Cast iron is a class of iron-carbon alloys with a carbon content more than 2%. Its usefulness derives from its relatively low melting temperature. The alloy constituents affect its color when fractured: white cast iron has carbide impurities which allow cracks to pass straight through, grey cast iron has graphite flakes which deflect a passing crack and initiate countless new cracks as the

## Cast Iron: Properties, Processing and Applications - Matmatch
Cast iron is an iron alloy containing 2 wt.% - 4 wt.% carbon, 1 wt.% - 3 wt.% silicon and smaller amounts of minor elements [1]. In comparison, steel has a lower carbon content of up to 2 wt.% and a lower silicon content. Cast iron can also be further optimized by alloying with small quantities of manganese, molybdenum, cerium, nickel, copper, vanadium and titanium before being cast.

Generally, chrome ore is required The particle size is 40/70 mesh, or even coarser. However, in the past ten years, small castings in the automotive engine industry have also used chrome ore in large quantities. This is mainly due to the high refractoriness of chrome ore, which can result in smooth and high-quality castings.

## White Cast Iron - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
J.W. Martin, in Materials for Engineering (Third Edition), 2006 White cast iron. White cast iron has a low silicon content and may contain carbide-stabilizing elements (such as Cr). When cooled rapidly from the melt, graphite formation does not occur and the microstructure may be predicted from Fig. 3.21 to consist of dendrites of austenite in a matrix of eutectic (iron carbide + austenite).
