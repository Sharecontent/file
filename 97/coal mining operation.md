## Mining Industry Profile | Department of Energy
The energy-intensive nature of mining is evident by the recovery ratio of the various materials being mined. Coal, with an average recovery ratio of 82%, requires the mining of 1.2 tons of material to recover 1 ton of coal. Industrial minerals have an average recovery ratio of 90%, while metals have an average recovery ratio of 4.5%.

## Basic Information about Surface Coal Mining in Appalachia
Once coal removal is complete, final regrading takes place and the area is revegetated. The operation is required to reclaim the mine to "AOC" or "approximate original contours" unless this requirement has been waived by the agency that has granted the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) permit for the operation.

## The coal mining life cycle - Mining for schools
Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was the primary purchaser of steam coal in the 1950's and 1960's from Gentry.

Thus, surface mining operations became an economic alternative to underground mining. Surface mining involves the excavation of all the rock and soil above the desired coal seam, exposing it at the surface. With the rise of surface mining, coal production steadily increased until 1970. Since this time, production has decreased.
