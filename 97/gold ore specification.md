## Gold Ore - Official Terraria Wiki
Gold Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is to make Gold Bars, which can be used to make the Gold tier of equipment, as well as crowns, Thrones, and several other items. The equivalent of Gold Ore is Platinum Ore, which will sometimes replace Gold in a world. Gold Ore has a small chance to appear as a bonus drop from slimes.

## Gold Ore - Item - TBC Classic - Wowhead
Last night I was making the circuit around the Alterac mountains and I found a total of 5 Gold Veins (two spawned in a row in the exact same place behind one of the synidcate camps north of Strahnbrad) and 4 Silver Veins (got the usual 2-4 ores per vein, no gems from the Gold but one of the Silvers yielded a gem).
