## Mining Processes: Surface Mining
Mining is the process used to obtain valuable resources from the Earth. This is done to acquire supplies that cannot be produced or manufactured through artificial methods. There are numerous techniques to extract these materials. The most commonly used procedures are underground mining, surface mining, placer mining and in-situ mining.

## Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation | ArcNews - Esri
Surface coal mining involves disturbing overlying rock layers ( overburden) to expose and extract coal reserves using the area mining method wherein the overburden above the uppermost coal seam and the innerburden between the lower coal seams are removed in parallel strips (pits) across the coalfield until the area is mined.

## Coal Processing - Multotec
Coal surface mining is implemented when coal is less than 60 metres underground. Large machines remove the topsoil and layers of rock known as overburden to expose coal seams. Mountaintop removal is a form of surface mining where the tops of mountains are dynamited and removed to access coal seams. Underground mining, or deep mining, is

coal mining, extraction of coal deposits from the surface of Earth and from underground. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel on Earth. Its predominant use has always been for producing heat energy. It was the basic energy source that fueled the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries, and the industrial growth of that era in turn supported the large-scale exploitation of coal

Coal Mining Coal seams can be mined by surface or underground methods ( Figure 4.3 ), with the choice of mining method dictated by both technical and economic factors. The most important technical factors are the thickness of the coal seam, the depth of the coal seam, the inclination of the seam, and the surface topography.

Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.

Mining & Processing. Coal in Wyoming is uncovered and removed by large machines in a process called surface mining. Before the coal can be removed from the ground, the topsoil and dirt above it is removed using scrapers. This soil is usually removed ahead of the pit and carried behind to place on top of reclaimed areas or backfill.
