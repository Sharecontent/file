## Dirty Gravel or Clean Gravel for a Driveway/Parking Area?
 I used the "Crusher run" until it was a stable base then added a course of P-57 gravel (stones about 3/4") over the. base. Now the dust is gone and the tracking too. The water goes under the p-57 stone leaving a cleaner surface for driving on. I like it so far. I'll try to post the latest picture of the new car barn in NC

## crushed run or 8 line
1 Answer. Crushed gravel is the media of choice for providing drainage. What you want is to have the maximum amount of airspace in the drainage layer so water has somewhere to go. Normally you would use 5/8" or even 7/8" crushed gravel but 3/8" will do. Pea stone gravel would not be my first choice as it will pack down over time and provide

Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.
