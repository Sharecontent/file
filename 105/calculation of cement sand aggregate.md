Sand Volume - 0.423 m 3. Coarse Aggregate - 0.845 m 3. Water Cement Ratio Calculation. From the IS Code standard, Assuming the water-cement ratio for M20 is 0.55. Therefore required water quantity = Cement Volume X WC Ratio = 0.282 X 0.55 = 0.1551 m 3 Unit weight of water = 1000 Litres / m 3 Water Quantity in Litres = 155.1 Litres

There are two main ways to design the concrete mix. Design mix method :- In this method, materials are proportioned based on the procedure and rules given in IS 456 (2000) and IS 10262) code . In this method, cement, sand and aggregates are always batched in terms of weight, and concrete can be designed for different environmental conditions and different needs.
