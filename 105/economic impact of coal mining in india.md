## Over 13mn dependent on coal economy in India: Study
Nov 23, 2021November 23, 2021, 13:09 IST. New Delhi: A study to assess the ' Socio-economic impacts of coal transition in India ' released on Monday has said that at a conservative estimate, more than 13 million people employed in coal mining, transport, power, sponge iron, steel, and bricks sectors will be impacted due to the impending coal transition.

## Why Coal Reforms Are So Important For The Indian Economy
After nationalisation of coal industry in India, India never witnessed demand-supply gap until 1991. Soon after came the liberalisation of India with a clear impact on economic growth. In 1993, to focus on the increasing energy demand, the government decided to allocate coal mines to various players for captive consumption.

## Environmental degradation in India's oldest coal mining belt leaves 
Decades of unabated coal mining can irreversibly change the character of an area and that is the story of Raniganj Coalfields, India's oldest coalfield area spread over West Bengal and parts of Jharkhand. Although mining started in this area in 1774, environmental degradation worsened when open-cast mines made their appearance 30 years ago.

## OPINION: Mining sector in India post COVID-19
As per the Indian Mineral Yearbook 2018 of Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), the mining sector employed around 4.77 lakh people in FY18, excluding atomic and minor minerals. Bulk of these people were employed by coal PSUs. However, many casual laborers are employed across most mines and the real employment in the sector is likely to be much higher.
