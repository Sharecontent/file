What type of gravel is the best for my shed foundation? I usually recommend 3/4″ stone, which is also called 57 Granite. Another option is "crusher run," which is a mix of 3/4″ stone and smaller stones. Which type of gravel you should use depends partly on whether or not your shed will be located in a wet area.

## What Is #57 Stone? - Dirt Connections
Crushed stone varies in size. The number "57" is a number that refers to the size sieve that was used to screen and sort the stone. It means that the stone was put through the #57 sieve which produces gravel stones of about 1" to 1.5" in size. #1 crushed stone refers to the largest sized crushed stone. It is about 2″ to 4″ in size.
