## How we make our fertilizer | Yara International
In a modern plant, nitrogen fertilizer is produced from natu­ral gas. In several transformation steps, natural gas, essentially methane, is upgraded by combination with nitrogen from the air to form nitrogen fertilizer. 80% of the gas is used as feed­stock for fertilizer while 20% is used for heating the process and producing electricity.

Ammonia production depends on plentiful supplies of energy, predominantly natural gas.Due to ammonia's critical role in intensive agriculture and other processes, sustainable production is desirable. This is possible by using non-polluting methane pyrolysis or generating hydrogen by electrolysis of water (or steam) utilizing zero carbon electricity from renewable energy sources or nuclear power.

Advantages of Urea Fertilizer 15. • Highly soluble in water so requires better packaging quality. • Not as stable as other solid nitrogenous fertilizers. • Decomposes even at room temperatures that results in serious loss. • If urea contains impurities more than 2 percent, it cannot be used as a fertilizer, since the impurities are toxic.

## Fertilizer life cycle perspective | Yara International
Urea has a lower carbon footprint at the production stage of the fertilizer life cycle than ammonium nitrate. Mainly due to the fact that part of the CO 2 generated in ammonia production is captured in the urea. However, the CO 2 is released as soon as the urea is spread on the field.
