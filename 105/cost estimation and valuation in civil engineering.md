## Construction Cost Estimating: Basics and Beyond |Smartsheet
Value engineering, which examines the function-to-cost ratio of a project, aims at making the design as cost efficient as possible. Finally, all cost estimates add at least a tenth, and sometimes closer to a fifth, of the construction total to account for contingencies. Contingencies are allowances held in reserve for unexpected costs.

Annual Depreciation, D = (original cost of the asset - Scrap Value)/life in years. For example, a vehicle that depreciates over 5 years, is purchased at a cost of US$17,000, and will have a salvage value of US$2000, will depreciate at US$3,000 per year: ($17,000 ? $2,000)/ 5 years = $3,000 annual straight-line depreciation expense.

## What is Estimation and Costing in Civil Engineering?
Mar 5, 2022Estimation is done to determine the cost of a project, whereas costing is done to determine the cost of a single item of work. Estimation is necessary to calculate the cost of a project in order to know if it's worth doing or not. Cost estimation in civil engineering doesn't take into account depreciation, which makes the cost estimate
