## The setting mechanism of mineral trioxide aggregate - PMC
Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is a powder containing calcium silicate composed of hydrophilic particles which harden at the presence of moisture.  Soluble components react at different speeds and rates, heat occurs during the reaction, and new products form. The resulting new products cause the setting of MTA cement and provide bonding to

## Mineral aggregate - Big Chemical Encyclopedia
Ore. A mineral or aggregate of minerals from which a valuable constituent, especially a metal, can be profitably extracted. A (4-Hydroxyphenyl)glycine. This derivative (23) forms aggregate spheres or shiny leaflets from water. It turns brown at 200°C, begins to melt at 220°C, and melts completely with decomposition at 245 —247°C.

## Mineral
A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids. Some rocks, such as limestone or quartzite, are composed primarily of one mineral - calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone, and quartz in the latter case. Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar.

A mineral is a naturally occurring inorganic element or compound having an orderly internal structure and characteristic chemical composition, crystal form, and physical properties. Common minerals include quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, olivine, and calcite. A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals, or a body of undifferentiated mineral matter.

## Aggregates: Mineral information, data and localities.
Aggregate is a broad classification of coarse to medium-grained rock material intended for use in construction. This can include sand, gravel, crushed stone and mine waste, and rocks of all types can be mined or quarried for aggregate - making use of what is locally available for local construction rather than bringing higher quality rock from elsewhere at greater expense.
