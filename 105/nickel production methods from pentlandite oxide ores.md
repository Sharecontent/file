Production and use There are two commercial classes of nickel ore, the sulfide ores (pentlandite and pyrrhotite) and the silicate-oxide. Most nickel is produced from the sulfide ores, and the two largest producers, Canada and the Russian Federation, account for 20-25% each of total annual production, which was 784.82 thousand tonnes in 1988 (5).

Ores Sulfides. Canadian ores are sulfides containing nickel, copper, and iron. The most important nickel mineral is pentlandite, (Ni, Fe) 9 S 8, followed by pyrrhotite, usually ranging from FeS to Fe 7 S 8, in which some of the iron may be replaced by nickel. Chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, is the dominant copper mineral in these ores, with small amounts of another copper mineral, cubanite, CuFe 2 S 3.

Pentlandite is an important ore of nickel. However, it does not produce good crystals and is generally only found in massive form. It is commonly associated with other sulfides such as pyrite, chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite in basic igneous rock intrusions. These sulfide ore bodies are probably produced through magmatic segregation.
