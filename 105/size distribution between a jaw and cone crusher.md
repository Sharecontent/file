## Type of crushers and their difference - JXSC Mining
Jaw crusher is used as primary crusher, it's reduction ratio is usually 6:1. It uses compressive force to break the material, this mechanical pressure is achieved by the two jaws of the crusher.  These stages are used to better control and size the output. Impact crushers and cone crushers tend to be used during these stages to better

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

Source Babu and Cook The product of a jaw crusher will have a size distribution such that the -80 fraction size (d80) is slightly less than the open-side setting of the crusher. For example if the open- side setting is 6 inches the d80 product size will be 5 inches.

## Should I Choose an Impact Rock Crusher or Cone Crusher? - Sepro Aggregates
Cone Crusher Applications. Cone crushers, a type of compression crusher, have less versatility than a horizontal impact crusher, but a great capability to guarantee a finished product size. If set at 2", typically 80% of the final product will meet the 2" target which is not something that can be replicated by jaw crushers or impact crushers.

## Difference between standard medium and short head cone crushers
What's the difference between them? 1. The shape of crushing chamber is different. The parallel belt of the short head cone crusher is longer, the medium-sized one is the second, and the standard type is the shortest. 2. The particle size of crushed products is different. The short head cone crusher with long parallel belt can crush fine materials.

A jaw crusher is able to crush a material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is used for secondary crushing. The input to the cone crusher is much smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher. The granularity of the materials that are crushed in the cone crushers is about 35mm to 350 mm.

Performance Different. 1. The rotating speed of the movable cone of the gyratory crusher is low, the stroke is small. And the ore is mainly crushed and broken and bent. The cone crusher has 2.5 times higher rotating speed and 4 times larger swinging angle than the gyratory crusher, so the ore is impacted quickly.
