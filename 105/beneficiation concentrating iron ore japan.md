## Iron ore beneficiation - PDF Free Download
In terms of average production of iron ore in the United States from 1942 to 1946 about 15 per cent represents beneficiated intermediate ore from the Lake Superior district, three per cent from the Northeastern district, and one per cent from the Southeastern district. Thus the bulk of the concentrate comes from Minnesota.

In general, iron ore beneficiation is done at the mining site. The concentrated iron ore is subsequently sintered or pelletized, depending on the grain size distribution, before it is charged to an ironmaking plant.  These measures allowed the iron content of the iron ore concentrate and the resulting pellets to attain 69.2% and 66.5%
