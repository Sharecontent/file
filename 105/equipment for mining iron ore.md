By the late 1600's and early 1700's, iron ore was still being mined in Virginia and western Massachusetts. Small scale bloomeries, the most primitive form of smelting, reduced the ore into a porous mass of iron slag called bloom or sponge iron .The bloom was hammered into a low quality wrought iron by using hand held or large, heavy hammers

## Iron ore extraction techniques - ScienceDirect
Iron ore was won by drilling and blasting ().As mining technology generally developed, so did drilling techniques and the explosives used. Smith (1990) reported that the Cleveland deposit was associated with a very strong stone roof rock (known as "dogger") allowing mine drivages to be self-supporting. However, he states that in later years where the mining had progressed to the dip, this

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Mining is a skill that allows players to obtain ores and gems from rocks. The higher a player's Mining level is the more likely they are to successfully extract ore. With ores, a player can then either smelt bars and make equipment using the Smithing skill or sell them for profit. Mining is one of the most popular skills in RuneScape as many players try to earn a profit from the skill.

When any ore body lies a considerable distance below the surface, the amount of waste that has to be removed in order to uncover the ore through surface mining becomes prohibitive, and underground techniques must be considered. Counting against underground mining are the costs, which, for each ton of material mined, are much higher underground than on the surface.
