Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

The sulphur in pyrite reacts with water to form sulphuric acid. Chemical companies used to produce this from pyrite ore, but now the useful chemical comes from a by-product of natural gas and crude oil processing. This has caused pyrite's economic value to plummet, and miners now only extract the mineral for specimen purposes. Cinnabar
