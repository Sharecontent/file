Iron Discovery . Discovery Date: Ancient Times Name: Iron derives its name from the Anglo-Saxon 'iren'.The element symbol, Fe, was shortened from the Latin word 'ferrum' meaning 'firmness'. History: Ancient Egyptian iron objects have been dated to around 3500 B.C. These objects also contain approximately 8% nickel showing the iron may have originally been part of a meteorite.

## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

## Physical Properties of Iron - Science Struck
Physical Properties of Iron Element. Pure iron is known to be a soft metal, with a silver white or grayish color. Some of its most important properties are ductility, malleability and thermal conductivity. Malleability lets Iron be beaten into sheets, without cleavage and ductility makes it possible for thin wires to be drawn from it.
