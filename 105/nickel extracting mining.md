The dissolving of the nickel anodes follows the same general pattern, the products being pure nickel cathodes and an anode slime containing the bulk of the platinum group metals. In this case the electrolyte is a neutral solution of nickel sulphate containing boric acid as a buffer and has to be continually purified to produce a pure cathode.

Nickel is almost completely extracted by LIX64N prior to cobalt solvent extraction. Typical nickel-copper raffinate contains only about 0.01 g/l Ni and <0.001 g/l Cu. Zinc, on the other hand, is crowded (displaced) from LIX64N by the maximum loading of nickel and copper. Therefore, zinc will remain in the nickel-copper raffinate.

Feb 15, 2021The rise in nickel mining is attributed to the Kambalda region in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia. Nickel ore grades in the 1960s had 4% nickel but within a decade the nickel ore grade in Australia fell to 2%. Over the last 20 years, low grade laterite or sulphide deposits have posted an average ore grade of about 1.2%.

## Nickel element extraction, mining technique - flash, electric smelting 
After producing the nickel matte, auxiliary processing is completed by means of the Sherrit-Gowden development. 1st copper is unconcerned by toting up hydrogen sulfide, parting a muse of solitary cobalt and nickel. Solvent extraction then proficiently disconnects the cobalt and nickel, with the final nickel focus 99%.

## Mining for electric car batteries 'hundreds of times' better than 
In 2035 over a fifth of the lithium and nickel, and 65% of the cobalt, needed to make a new battery could come from recycling. Europe will likely produce enough batteries to supply its own EV

## nickel processing | Britannica
The mining of laterites is basically an earth-moving operation, with large shovels, draglines, or front-end loaders extracting the nickel-rich strata and discarding large boulders and waste material. The ore is loaded into trucks at the face, as would be the case in an open pit, and hauled to the smelter.
