## New World Iron Ore Farming (How to Farm, Locations & Uses)
Farming Iron Ore is quite simple, you simply need to have a Pickaxe of any kind and will need to search for Iron Veins to mine. Iron Veins can be mined with any mining level and can be tracked once your mining level reaches 25 and above. You will mostly find Iron veins in groups of three along hills and mountains, a bigger chance to spot them
