## The working principle of a washing machine is? - Vedantu
So, we can say that the working principle of the washing machine is centrifugation. Correct answer is option (C) Note: A body moving on a circular path has two forces acting on it. One is centripetal force and the other is centrifugal force. A body moving in a circular path will constantly change direction and hence will change velocity.
