Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done. Ore is first crushed and then undergoes various processes depending on the nature of associated minerals. Processing low-grade ore is relatively simple while higher grades require more extensive processing.

## hard rock gold extraction process
Gold mining is the process of obtaining gold or gold ores from the ground. A variety of techniques are typically used to obtain gold including, placer mining, gold panning, sluicing, dredging, rocker box, hard-rock mining, and by product mining. Dating back to at least 4700 BC, gold mining has been a major industry for thousands of years.

Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

This is a mining method that employs the processes that increase the concentration of gold in the ore by selectively removing the lighter materials. This is the most effective method when gold is found in rocks or other hard soils. First the rock containing the gold ore is crushed to decrease its grain size.

## Hydraulic mining
Hydraulic mining is a form of mining that uses high-pressure jets of water to dislodge rock material or move sediment. In the placer mining of gold or tin, the resulting water-sediment slurry is directed through sluice boxes to remove the gold. It is also used in mining kaolin and coal.. Hydraulic mining developed from ancient Roman techniques that used water to excavate soft underground deposits.
