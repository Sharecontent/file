Uses Of The Abrasion Test. For an aggregate to perform satisfactorily on the pavement, it must be difficult enough to resist the abrasive effect of traffic for a long period of time. Soft aggregates will be quickly crushed into powder, while hard aggregates are quite resistant to crushing. The test will also determine the quality of the aggregate.

Aggregate Water Absorption Test. Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate. Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength, impact and hardness tests. Water absorption shall not be more than 2% per unit by weight.
