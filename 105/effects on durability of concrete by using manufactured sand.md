has become a viable alternative to the river sand. Ready mix concrete (RMC) is playing vital role in fast-track construction particularly in Tire-II cities in India. The strength and durability concerns about using 100% manufactured sand along with mineral admixtures in RMC plant needs to be addressed through suitable experimental demonstrations.

Effect Of Msand On Durability Properties Of The Concrete the manufactured sand and the cement are mixed in appropriate proportions to make concrete. since the particles of msand are evenly shaped and are of the same size and fine in nature, the amount of void in the concrete is reduced making it even more durable without having to rely on the excessive cement for durability and hardening.

## Use of Manufactured Sand in Concrete and Construction An Alternate to 
The Civil engineers, Architects, Builders, and Contractors agree that the river sand, which is available today, is deficient in many respect. It does content very high silt fine particles (as in case of Filter sand). Presence of other impurities such as coal, bones, shells, mica and silt etc makes it inferior for the use in cement concrete.
