## Properties of recycled aggregate and recycled aggregate concrete 
In the present investigation, an attempt was made to study the influence of the strength of parent concrete on the properties of recycled aggregates and recycled aggregate concrete. In this study, four grades of normal concrete mixes: M20, M25, M30, and M40 were considered as parent concrete to produce the recycled coarse aggregates and recycled aggregate concrete. Four recycled coarse

## Different Grade of Concrete: M20, M25, M30, their Mix ratio and Uses.
While M20 grade concrete is used for RCC works (for mild exposure) such as the construction of slabs, beams, columns, footings, etc. 2. Standard Grade: M25, M30, M35, M40, and M45, fall in the category of the standard grade of concrete. The concrete grades ranging from M25 to M35 are mostly used to construct RCC works such as footings, columns

## Strength and durability of concrete containing recycled concrete aggregates
The 28 day compressive strength of concrete specimens containing natural aggregates and specimens containing recycled concrete aggregates were determined by testing cubes of size 150 mm × 150 mm× 150 mm as per IS:516 in a compression testing machine of capacity 2000 kN.
