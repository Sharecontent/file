Yes. Crater lakes atop volcanoes are typically the most acid, with pH values as low as 0.1 (very strong acid). Normal lake waters, in contrast, have relatively neutral pH values near 7.0.The crater lake at El Chichon volcano in Mexico had a pH of 0.5 in 1983 and Mount Pinatubo's crater lake had a pH of 1.9 in 1992.

## Why Are Acidic Cleaners Dangerous to Use on Granite?
Why Acids Damage Granite. The reason acidic cleaners damage natural stone is because stone contains some concentration of calcite, which reacts to even weak acids by dissolving. Marble and limestone have a high amount of calcite and are most susceptible to etching, but granite is not impervious. In addition to some calcite, granite also has

## But wait, I thought granite was immune to acid damage?
Nov 29, 2021A strong acid will eat almost anything, including granite. This is doubly true when the acid is in contact with the stone for a long time, as is the case with a bottle of cleaner left on the countertop. The chemistry of the ways various minerals dissolve in acids is complex, but the bottom line is that strong cleaners can damage natural stone.

I think it's saying that the lake will suffer more damage, because the granite will not mitigate the effect of the acid. The runoff that fills the lake will have basically the same pH, as opposed to limestone, which will tend to neutralize the acid. Its lack of reaction means that it won't be weathered much by acid in rain.

To reduce the appearance of etching in kitchen countertop applications, choose a honed, white marble with a low-moderate absorption rating. To reduce the appearance of staining, always wipe up spills immediately. Oil and highly-pigmented liquids can penetrate and stain the stone and may need poultice to remove the stain.
