## processing cobalt ores with shaker tables
Production of cobalt from copper-cobalt ores on the Sep 01, 2020 Sep 01, 2020 Gravity separation is used to upgrade cobalt-rich ore, usually as a pre-concentration process to reduce the gangue load to the plant. Jigs, shaking tables, and dense media separation (DMS) plants have been used (Shengo et al., 2019).

The ore was shown to contain high Fe and As concentrations and negligible Zn and Ni concentrations. Cobaltite (CoAsS) and erythrite (Co 3 (AsO 4) 2.8H 2 O) made up the two main cobalt‐bearing minerals in the ore. The washing processes that were conducted based on a historical text rendered the ore more enriched with erythrite.
