## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Working Principle of Crusher
Crusher. Industrial crushers crush or deform materials through impact or pressure, thereby reducing large pieces of rock, ore, or waste to a smaller size. During the primary crushing operation, the boulder size feed is reduced from 20 to 100 inches to the secondary crusher size of 1 to 20 inches or the ground feed size of 0.5 to 3 inches.

Jaw crushers are used as primary crushers, or the first step in the process of reducing rock. They crush primarily by using compression. The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal, one of which then moves inwards towards the rock, and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing metal piece.
