In the production of cement, firstly, the limestone and clay are crushed through a crusher then, this produced powder put into a mixer and this goes to rotating heater with the help of pipe which is attached between the mixer and rotating heater. The flame is also used to heat the crushed powder. after it, the output is grinder in the grinder.

In general, we can divide the cement production line into three main steps: raw material preparation of cement, clinker production, and cement grinding. Each step has some cement manufacturing machines, such as raw mill, cement crusher, cement mill, cement kiln, cement cooler, cement dryer, cement silo, cement packer, etc.
