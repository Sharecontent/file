## electrowinning of iron from sulphate solutions
A South African mining group is investigating the use of electrowinning (EW) to recover iron and H 2 SO 4 from an iron sulphate waste solution produced during metal beneficiation. For the purpose of this paper, the term electrowinning, as is commonly applied for this process, is used throughout the paper.

## Zinc smelting Hero Dictionary
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc. Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless specific

## Etching copper without acid
It takes 35 min to get a deep etch. The etch time can be altered with different ratios of water to ferric chloride. WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT THIS PROCESS 1. Best of all, we have no solvents in our studio therefore no crazy smells. 2. Our etching solution gives off no toxic vapors and as a result has no potential for violent reactions if there is a spill.

In recent years very little has been published in the literature about electrowinning of iron from mineral ores in acid electrolytes. However, a related problem has been addressed in connection with the recovery of Zn and Fe from spent pickling solutions (Csicsovszki et al., 2005).Here iron deposition from hydrochloric solutions was studied in a two-compartment cell using an ion-exchange membrane.
