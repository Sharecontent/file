## Is Painting Brick a Good Idea & Which Paint to Use? - Ecohome
Applying mineral paints and dyes to bricks should offer you a maintenance-free service life of 20-30 years. Silica paints and dyes are odorless, non-toxic and do not contain any volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In addition, they are incombustible, and in addition to being healthier, they are safer to work with.

Types of Building Materials Used in Construction 1. Natural Construction Materials  Bricks were widely used as a construction material in the 1700, 1800 and 1900s.  The most common form of concrete is Portland cement concrete, which consists of mineral aggregate (generally gravel and sand), portland cement and water.

Bricks and tiles are made from clay minerals. When wet, the clay can be shaped, and then fired to make floor, wall, and roof tiles, as well as house bricks. You can see why we make bricks from clay. As well as being an ingredient in bricks, clay minerals also make up much of the material used to stick them together - Portland cement.

Concrete is, after water, the second most widely used material on the planet. The manufacturing of concrete generates about 4.5 percent of the world's human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. Replacing even a small portion of concrete with irradiated plastic could thus help reduce the cement industry's global carbon footprint.

## Wool Bricks? An Interesting Collaboration Between Sheep and
Wool bricks are made by adding wool fibers to the regular clay material used to make bricks, then combined with an alginate conglomerate, a natural polymer extracted from the cell walls of seaweed. They are naturally dried (rather than the energy-intensive and polluting process of firing) and the result is a brick that is less prone to cracking

## The Classification of Fire Bricks - RS Kiln Refractory Bricks
Clay bricks are mainly composed of mullite (25% - 50%), glass phase (25% - 60%), and cristobalite and quartz (up to 30%). Usually, hard clay is used as raw material to pre-calcinate into mature materials, then mixed with soft clay to form semi-dry or plastic forming. The temperature is fired at 1300~1400 C to produce clay brick products.

Silica: It exists in clay either as free or combined. As free sand, it is mechanically mixed with clay. In combine form, it exists in chemical composition with alumina. A good brick material should contain about 50% to 60% of silica. The presence of this constituent prevents cracking, shrinking and warping of raw bricks.
