## Crushed Concrete Aggregates - Properties and Uses of Recycled 
Shear strength of recycled aggregate concrete is lesser than of normal concrete. This is because the recycled aggregate from field-demolished concrete for example can be relatively weaker than a typical natural aggregate. In general, there is a 10% decrease in strength when recycled coarse aggregates are used. Uses of Crushed Concrete Aggregates

Aggregates with lower crushing value show a lower crushed fraction under load and would give a longer service life to the road and hence a more economical performance. If we used a weaker would get crushed under traffic loads, would produce smaller pieces not coated with a binder, and these would be easily displaced or loosened out resulting in loss of the surface/layer.

## Recycled Concrete Aggregates - Its Uses, Properties, Advantages 
History. Recycled concrete aggregates or Crushed concrete aggregates has been in use since the ancient times, only to be integrated with gravel, sand, and cement to ensure durability. The practice was first recorded in the 1860s. US construction companies were reluctant to use the technique at first since crushing cured concrete proved to be much more cost-intensive in terms of labor.

From this point the rock is tapered away on a "3-to-1" slope to an eventual distance of 9 feet,.

The recycled aggregate controls comparatively fewer bulk density, impact and crushing values, and higher absorption of water in comparison with natural aggregate. The strength of recycled concrete is comparatively fewer, up to 10-14% than natural concrete. The variation turns on to obtained original concrete.
