## Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag as a Cement Replacement in 
Feb 23, 2022The goal of the current study is to determine the dissolving effect of slag in water. Five percentage values of slag were taken up for the study: 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. The study is based on two methods of mixing. The first method is the traditional mixing process, which involves addition of slag directly with other concrete proportions such as cement, sand, water, coarse aggregate, and

## Electric arc furnace granulated slag for sustainable concrete
Granulated blast furnace slag (GBS) is the most important steel industry by-product. The production is almost 0.23 tons of slag for each ton of cast iron and 0.1 ÷ 0.2 tons for each ton of steel [12]. According to EUROSLAG data [13], the production of granulated blast furnace slag was 23 million tons in 2012.

A substantial amount of portland cement (PC) is required in grouting practice for soils and rocks. These grouting applications are relatively new areas in which PC could be substituted by high amounts of granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and fly ash (FA) to produce grouts with low cost, environmental friendliness, good workability, and excellent long-term performance.

## Green concrete with ground granulated blast-furnace slag activated by 
This paper studies the mechanical properties and hydration of green concrete which is made from ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS), desulfurization gypsum (DG) and electric arc furnace reducing slag (EAFRS) as cementitious materials. The green concrete with a water to cementitious materials ratio of 0.32 yields a compressive strength over 50 MPa at 28 days. The hydration mechanisms of

## Special Concrete: Types, Uses, Advantages and Disadvantages
10. GGBS, Slag-based concrete: GGBS (Ground Granulated Blast-furnace Slag) is a cementitious substance that is a by-product of the blast furnaces used to make iron. About 1,500 °C is the operating temperature of blast furnaces, which are supplied with a precisely regulated mixture of limestone, coke, and iron ore.
