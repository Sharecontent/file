## Data Warehouse Schema (Chapter 13) - Data Mining and Data Warehousing
It defines how the data are organized and how the relations among them are associated. Data warehouse schema consists of the name and description of records including associated data items and aggregates. A database uses relational models whereas a data warehouse uses different types of schema, namely, Star, Snowflake, and Fact Constellation.

Data mining consists in a series of statistical techniques that analyze the data in a warehouse in order to discover useful knowledge that is not easy to obtain from the original data. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are measurable organizational objectives that are used for characterizing how an organization is performing.

## Aggregate (data warehouse) - HandWiki
Aggregates are used in dimensional models of the data warehouse to produce positive effects on the time it takes to query large sets of data.At the simplest form an aggregate is a simple summary table that can be derived by performing a Group by SQL query. A more common use of aggregates is to take a dimension and change the granularity of this dimension.
