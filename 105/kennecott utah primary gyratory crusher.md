A crusher of these dimensions will break 40 tons per hour to 2½-in. size with a power consumption of 30 h.p. On the other hand, a 14-in. gyratory crusher, working as it should at full capacity, will crush 100 tons per hour to the same size with a power consumption of 70 h.p. ; at 40 tons per hour, it would still require about 50 h.p.
