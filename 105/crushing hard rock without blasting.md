Choose correct type of Dexpan® based on ambient and core temperature. Core temperature is the temperature inside of the rock or concrete, which can be different from the ambient temperature. In a bucket, combine 0.4 gallons (or Three 500mL bottles) of cold water with one 11 Lb. (or 5 Kg.) bag of Dexpan®. Mix well to a slurry, no lumps.

## Rock Excavation Cost | Specialty Grading
The cost of a typical residential excavation work averages at around $3500. Land excavators usually measure cost by cubic yards of dirt moved, which can run anywhere from $50 to $200 for every cubic yard. Rock excavation can cost much more than the usual excavation. Depending on the site, rock excavators can charge between $40-100 per cubic yard.
