## Conveyor Belt Design |authorSTREAM
The conveyor belt design can be determined by both the function it is intended to perform and the facility in which it will be used. There are simple linear belt conveyor systems that simply take materials from one place to another until the end product is created. Other businesses, however, may require more complicated processes; the conveyor

## Factors to Consider When Designing Conveyor I
The dimension and type of the conveyor belt determine the driven and driver pulley diameter. The essence of having the right diameter is to ensure that no undue stress is put on the belt in times of operation. The length from the center pulley accounts for the length of the belt, considering the distance parallel to the belt line.

A transfer conveyor belt is usually driven at a low constant speed. Accordingly, a gear head induction motor with a reduction ratio of 60:1 is selected here as a driving power source. To transmit this driving power efficiently to the flat belt pulley for driving the conveyor belt, a chain-driven power transmission system is applied here:

The tubular conveyor belt has a much greater influence on the performance of the conveyor system than a standard belt. The main factor is the stiffness of the tubular belt, as the belt is wound into a tube from the flat shape, the inherent flexural stiffness of the belt becomes the contact pressure on the surrounding rollers.

One small scale drying conveyor system found was built by a custom manufacturing company, Bemdorf. The conveyor is equipped with a hopper for loading product, an almost fully enclosed heat box and a discharge outlet as seen in Figure 1. The single belt conveyor is driven by an electric motor in the rear of the conveyor which drives the rear
