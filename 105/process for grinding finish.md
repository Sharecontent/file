## Grinding: accuracy and precision in the finishing process
Grinding has taken on a major role in the mould industry, thanks to its ability to provide extremely high levels of precision in finishes. In fact, one or more surfaces of many precision parts are ground in order to provide them with the necessary finish, in which high levels of concentration and accuracy are crucial, in order to avoid deviations.

The fraction of finish for annealed steels is 1/2 for rough grinding and 1/6 for finishing; for hardened steels, the rate is 1/4 for rough grinding and 1/8 for finishing. For example, a l-inch-wide wheel is used to rough grind a hardened steel cylinder with a work RPM of 300. Table travel = (25.4 x 1/4 x 300) ÷ 100 » 19 m/mint

As the abrasive oscillates, the workpiece rotates or oscillates under a cup or cylinder, producing microfine chips. The process removes as little as 0.5 micron (0.00002 inch) or as much as 20 microns (0.008 inch) of material.

Surface finish refers to the process of altering a metal's surface that involves removing, adding, or reshaping. It is a measure of the complete texture of a product's surface that is defined by three characteristics of surface roughness, waviness, and lay. The surface roughness is the measure of the total spaced irregularities on the surface.

## Grit Size And Its Impact On The Grinding Process
Grit size, concentration, bond type plus hardness, and the grinding process (machine, wheel speed, coolant, work-piece) all greatly impact the surface finish achieved. Our engineers take all of these factors into consideration when optimizing custom grinding tools for our clients. Contact CDT for engineered superabrasive grinding solutions.
