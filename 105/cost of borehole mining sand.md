##  Selection of technological parameters in borehole mining  - TUKE
The intent of this article is to introduce borehole mining to a wider spectrum of drilling and mining professionals. The BHM method is based on in-situ water jet cutting of rock mass. On Fig. 1 the schematic of the method is presented. The borehole-mining tool 1 is lowered into the borehole 2 and high-pressure water 3 is pumped down.
