## What Are Some Pros and Cons of Quarrying?
Despite the benefits, quarrying also has negative impacts. The blasting needed in extracting the rock contributes greatly to noise pollution. The dust from the rock blasting is a major form of pollution. Roads frequently used by trucks to and fro the quarry industry may be expensive to maintain as they will require regular maintenance.

Quarries. Stone quarrying is a process by which rock is extracted from the ground and crushed to produce aggregate, which is then screened into desired sizes. This screened aggregate is then used for the construction of roads, rail lines, bridges, hospitals, schools, airports, factories, and homes, all of which has crucial impact on economic development of any country.

## 3. The Environmental Impacts of Aggregate Extraction | Toronto 
Aggregate is mined from the earth, either dug out of pits or blasted out of quarries. This process has many significant environmental impacts. [1] Creating the pits or quarries requires the removal of virtually all natural vegetation, top soil and subsoil to reach the aggregate underneath. Not only does this lead to a loss of existing animal

Sand, gravel or crushed rock excavated from a quarry is called aggregate. Aggregate is used in construction to create stable foundations for things like roads and railroad tracks. Aggregate is also used to make concrete and asphalt. For this reason, asphalt and concrete plants are often built next to quarries.
