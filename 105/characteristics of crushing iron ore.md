## Iron ore crushing and screening process
The iron ore processing and production process mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is more modern and suitable for high-hardness iron ore crushing and can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the subsequent grinding efficiency.

History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

Crushing involves reducing the ore size from various sizes ranging from particles as big as a human body, or just the size of your head or toe to an average 90 to 140mm for primary crushing or 40 to 55mm for secondary. Note the size depends on the plant design but generally it's a reduction in ore size from about 1000mm to 150mm for clarity's sake.
