Basalt. Basalt is a mafic volcanic rock consisting primarily of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene minerals.Common accessory minerals can include other pyroxenes, olivine, quartz, and nepheline.Basalt is the volcanic equivalent of the plutonic rock gabbro, and as such has a low silica content (48% - 52%). Like other volcanic rocks, basalt cools quickly after it erupts and therefore generally

Lunar basalt is found in groups 1, 3, and 4. Basaltic volcanic and lava rocks are found primarily in the Lunar mares. Their darker color differentiates them from the lighter pristine highland rocks. They were formed km below the surface, rose to the surface, and erupted (1, pg 184). The process is exactly the same as what happens on Earth.

Basalt is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon.Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.. Volcanic rock (or lava) that characteristically is dark in color (gray to black), contains 45 to 53 percent silica, and is rich in iron and magnesium.

## Cadmium In Basalt Rock
 The mean concentration of cadmium in basalt is 130 Î¼g/kg (range 6-600 Î¼g/kg; Page et al. 1987), which is relatively high for igneous rock. Therefore, it may be expected that background levels of cadmium in soils derived from the weathering of basalt are higher than that obtained from the weathering of other types of igneous rock.

Basalt is a fine-grained rock and therefore will not absorb a large amount of water. In addition to this, basalt is an igneous rock which makes it relatively sturdy. As a general rule, it is okay to climb on wet basalt after it rains as long as the basalt formation is in good condition and was previously climbable when dry.
