The United States reopened its Mountain Pass rare earths mine in California, which went bankrupt in 2017. The mine produced 26,000 metric tons of light rare earth oxide in concentrate form in 2019 and accounted for 12 percent of global production, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey. This helped reduce China's dominance of the first-stage.

Chambishi has the capacity to produce 55,000 tonnes per year of grade A copper cathodes and 6,800 tpy cobalt in the form of broken cathode, though output of the latter has been declining in recent years due to declining output from Boss Mining. Chambishi produced about 2,300 tonnes of cobalt in 2018.

In 2019, the country was the world's 7th largest producer of copper.. The Zambian economy has historically been based on the copper-mining industry. The industrialization of the copper industry is owed partly to Frederick Russell Burnham, the famous American scout who worked for Cecil Rhodes. By 1998, however, output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 tonnes, continuing a 30-year decline
