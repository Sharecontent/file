## Iron ore in focus 2: Ex-China demand downturn hits pellet trade
The downturn ex-China has prompted iron ore exporters to divert more supply to China, boosting pellet trade from Russia, Ukraine, Sweden and India. Brazil is the world's biggest exporter of pellets, despite a drop in shipments from 54 million mt in 2015 to 27 million mt in 2019. Key to this was the Fundão tailings dam disaster in late 2015
