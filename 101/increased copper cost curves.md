## The Law of Supply and Demand - Copper - Electrical Contractor Magazine
Economics is based upon the law of supply and demand (i.e., the study of the allocation of scarce resources). According to a study from geologists at Yale University, new discoveries of copper have raised global reserves by just 0.63 percent per year since 1925 but usage (final demand) has risen at 3.3 percent per year.

## Overview of Cost Curves in Economics - ThoughtCo
There are a few features to note about the total cost curve: The total cost curve is upward sloping (i.e. increasing in quantity). This simply reflects the fact that it costs more in total to produce more output. The total cost curve is generally bowed upwards. This isn't necessarily always the case- the total cost curve could be linear in

On a graph the TC curve is the same shape as the VC. The distance between the two curves is equal to the value of the Fixed costs. Marginal Cost: Marginal cost is the change in total cost divided by the change in quantity (MC = ∆TC/∆Q). Usually the change in quantity is just 1 so MC is the cost associated with producing just one more unit
