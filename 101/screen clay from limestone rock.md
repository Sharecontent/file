Limestone is a sedimentary rock with high concentrations of, or entirely of, calcium carbonate that mostly came from decomposed marine organisms.. Limestone is usually white, but it gets grayish to almost black in color with the presence of carbon or any organic matter. Traces of manganese or iron oxide can also discolor limestone rocks to a yellowish or reddish tinge.
