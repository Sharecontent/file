Copper Ore is the first ore to being mined, and is mined from Copper Veins. A mining pick and the Mining profession are required to mine. Copper Veins may be found in many starting areas where the typical creature level is between about 5 and 18. Mining Copper stops giving skillups at 100. The most common zones to have Copper Veins are: Elwynn Forest - High Dun Morogh - High Mulgore - Venture.

## Cobalt mineralra-cardenas
Cobalt helps us to power mobile phones, laptops, and electric cars. But while the metal is high in demand for green technology, getting it is the hard part.  Cobalt can also be found up north, as the NWT becomes a more interesting mineral destination for companies. 160km from Yellowknife is a gold-cobalt-bismuth-copper deposit being developed. Cobalt is a silvery gray metal that has diverse

## Why the world is demanding more cobalt, and why new methods for cobalt 
In terms of impurities, manganese is the most troublesome impurity for cobalt recovery, specifically from copper-cobalt ores, in which Mn is present in high quantities. Air/SO 2 or O 2 /SO 2 mixtures are used to oxidize and precipitate manganese from sulfates, commercially adopted at DRC copper-cobalt plants (Tenke, Fungurume, and Ruashi).
