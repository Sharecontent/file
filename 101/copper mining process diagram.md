## Copper Mining and Processing: Life Cycle of a Mine | Superfund
The stages in the life cycle of a mine are: Prospecting and Exploration. Development. Extraction. Closure/Reclamation. Each of the stages may overlap with the next and is very lengthy and expensive. 1. Prospecting and Exploration ("Finding and Defining it") Prospecting and exploration are precursors to mining and often occur simultaneously

## Hardrock Mining Techniques|Underground Mines|Minings Method
Underground mining (hard rock) Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals such as those containing metals like gold, copper, zinc, nickel and lead or gems such as diamonds. In contrast soft rock mining refers to excavation of softer minerals such as coal, or oil sands.

## Copper Mining and Extraction | Copper Mining Processing
Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

Open-pit mining is the process of extracting rock or minerals from the earth through their removal from an open pit or borrow. Figure 8.8. Open-pit mine [16]. Surface mining is usually used to develop coal seams and deposits of many other minerals, but their feasibilities vary with the nature of the body ore.
