## Collecting Rocks - USGS
Thousands of different types of rocks and minerals have been found on Earth. Most rocks at the Earth's surface are formed from only eight elements (oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and sodium), but these elements are combined in a number of ways to make rocks that are very different. Rocks are continually changing.

The study of geology is the study of the Earth, and so is ultimately the study of rocks. Geologists define a rock as: A bound aggregate of minerals, mineraloids, or fragments of other rocks. The use of the word 'bound' means that a rock must have structural integrity, e.g. an aggregate of sand does not become a rock until the grains are bound

Types of Rocks. Rocks usually differ in their formation, color, and composition. While there is an array of naturally colored stones out there, most of them have a prominent criterion which is the formation process of how rocks are made. Based on this, science has divided rocks into three categories-. Igneous Rocks. Sedimentary Rocks.

Minerals like magnetite, pyrrhotite, ilmenite, maghemite, awaruite, and sometimes garnet, and peridot are attracted by magnets. Serpentinite and ironstone are two types of rocks of strikingly different origins that are also attracted by magnets. Iron is an agent that gives rise to magnetic properties.

Rocks cannot be eaten. Minerals may be eaten. For example, salt. Rocks have no atomic structure or chemical content. Minerals have a distinct chemical content. Rocks come in a variety of forms, sizes, and colours. Minerals also have different shapes and colours. For example, basalt, granite, and so on.

Rocks and minerals are important for learning about earth materials, structure, and systems. Studying these natural objects incorporates an understanding of earth science, chemistry, physics, and math. The learner can walk away with an understanding of crystal geometry, the ability to visualize 3-D objects, or knowing rates of crystallization.

Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers. Metamorphic rocks result when existing rocks are changed by heat, pressure, or reactive fluids, such as hot, mineral-laden water. Most rocks are made of minerals containing silicon

Sep 1, 2022Minerals and rocks are technically different things. A mineral is an inorganic compound with a distinct chemical structure. Rocks are solid masses that consist of minerals and other compounds. A rock can contain multiple minerals or just a single mineral. A rock that contains just one mineral can be called a mono-mineralic rock.

There are two basic types: Intrusive igneous rocks crystallize below Earth's surface, and the slow cooling that occurs there allows large crystals to form. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite. Extrusive igneous rocks erupt onto the surface, where they cool quickly to form small crystals.
