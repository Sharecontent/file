## Some Problems in the Crushing and Grinding Stage of Mineral Processing
Some Problems in the Crushing and Grinding Stage of Mineral Processing. In order to select useful minerals from ores, it is necessary to crush the ores first so that the useful minerals in the ores can reach the state of monomer dissociation. The preparatory work before separation usually consists of two stages: crushing-screening and grinding
