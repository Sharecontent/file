## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Aggregates are mixed into the overlay topping material and applied to the old concrete to give it a new look. The "secret" to exposing the aggregates is keeping the top layer of cement paste soft while the underlying concrete hardens. This is done by spraying on a surface retardant immediately after installing the concrete and aggregates.

The main benefit that silicate provides is increased concrete surface strength. However, silicate isn't typically recommended for exposed aggregate. Instead, it's best used on polished concrete surfaces. While it's not quite as durable as silane, you can still get 15 to 25 years out of the sealer before having to reseal.

## What do you mean by recycled aggregate concrete?
What is an aggregate concrete? Concrete aggregates are composed of geological materials such as gravel, sand and crushed rock. The size of the particles determines whether it is a coarse aggregate (e.g. gravel) or a fine aggregate (e.g. sand). The resulting concrete can be used in its natural state or crushed, according to its use and application.

Fill a space with concrete (150 lb/ft³) Let's say we need to fill in an area of space measuring 5 feet long, 3 feet wide and 2 inches deep with concrete which costs $50 per US short ton. I want to work out an estimate for the volume of concrete required, how much it will weigh and the total expected cost of the project.

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
The proper concrete mixing ratios are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4 for cement, sand, and stone.  Aggregate (stone) You can use 3/8", 1/2", or 1/5" stone for aggregate  The sand tends to make the concrete a little more easier to work with. The less sand the rockier the mix is going to be. Cool things you can make by mixing your own concrete.
