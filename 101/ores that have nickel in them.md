## Nickel Ore and Metals Analysis - Johnston - Wiley Online Library
The section on nickel ores is divided into two broad classifications: sulfide and lateritic ores. Greater emphasis is given to the sample preparation of laterites since they are more difficult to handle and many laboratories do not have as much experience working with them as with sulfides. Each broad classification is broken down into the

## Nickel laterite ore; an ingredient for stainless steel
Data from the US Geological Survey mentions that nickel lateritic ores comprise about 60% of nickel resources and nickel sulphide 40%. Global nickel consumption is dominated by stainless steel (approximately 66% to 73%), followed by alloys, special steels, electroplating, batteries, and other uses. Up to 2016, the production of stainless steel

## Earth:Lateritic nickel ore deposits - HandWiki
Genesis and types of nickel laterites. Lateritic nickel ores formed by intensive tropical weathering of olivine-rich ultramafic rocks such as dunite, peridotite and komatiite and their serpentinized derivatives, serpentinite which consist largely of the magnesium silicate serpentine and contains approx. 0.3% nickel. This initial nickel content is strongly enriched in the course of lateritization.

## Uses of Nickel | Supply, Demand, Production, Resources - Geology
There were no active nickel mines in the United States in 2011, although small amounts of nickel were recovered as a byproduct from processing copper and palladium-platinum ores. Several deposits in Minnesota and Michigan have potential for development.. Recycled nickel is an extremely important source of supply. In 2011, recycled nickel accounted for approximately 43 percent of U.S. nickel

## Nickel Ore Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Nickel (element #28, symbol Ni) is a silvery shiny, metallic element. It can be hammered into thin sheets, which means it is malleable. Nickel was discovered in 1751 by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt. Iron, cobalt and nickel (numbers 26, 27 and 28 on the Periodic Table) are the only three elements known to be ferromagnetic (the strongest type of
