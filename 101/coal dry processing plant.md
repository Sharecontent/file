Safety features. Safe handling and processing of coal is of utmost importance. The system is designed with core safety principles: 1) Using low-temperature waste heat to slowly dry the coal without driving off volatiles; 2) processing the coal at just the right time before combustion to minimize the opportunity for moisture reabsorption and spontaneous combustion; and 3) using operating

Electrohydrodynamic drying. Like HVACP, electrohydrodynamic drying (EHD) uses ionized air. It creates an airflow, called "ionic wind," by running electricity through a pair of electrodes on either side of the food to be dried. The ionic wind dries food faster than conventional convective drying, due in part to the heat generated by the process.
