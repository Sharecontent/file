## Kaolin Processing Technology and Characteristics
Gravity separation. Gravity separation is mainly used in the beneficiation and purification of sandy and soft kaolin. The process is to add kaolin, water and dispersant to the ramming machine to mix a certain concentration of ore slurry, and pass the high-speed rotating impeller in the ramming machine The kaolin is separated from other minerals and organic matter such as quartz and feldspar
