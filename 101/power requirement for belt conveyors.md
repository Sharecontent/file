Thus TSHP is calculated as follows: TSHP = 0.256 + 1.320 = 1.576 H.P. Assuming a drive efficiency of 85% resulting in a total drive horsepower of 1.853, a standard 2 horsepower motor would be selected for the drive input. The horsepower required for the above conveyor may also be determined graphically by the use of the two horsepower nomographs.

For a belt drive system, the motor torque required during constant velocity is simply the total axial force (F a) on the belt multiplied by the radius (r 1) of the drive pulley. Tc = torque required during constant velocity (Nm) Fa = total axial force (N) r1 = radius of drive pulley (mm) η = efficiency of belt drive system.

## Conveyor Motor Power Calculation
Power calculations are typically considered the product of equivalent tension multiplied by belt speed. For belt conveyors, this may be equivalent tension (Te) (sum of friction, material acceleration and lift forces, in N) multiplied by conveyor belt speed (in m/s). Frication force is nominally the product of an artificial friction factor (unit

## Power Roller Conveyors | Electric Conveyor Belts
A Wide Online Selection of Power Conveyors & Electric Conveyor Belts. Belt conveyors provide smooth, completely flat transport of materials and products. Box-style, slider bed, and wire mesh conveyors all fall under the belt conveyor name. These have great qualities such as variable belt speed, heavy duty belt materials, and a variety of lengths.

## 14. Calculaiton of power required - John King Chains
Get in Touch. Once the MAXIMUM CHAIN PULL has been established, the following calculation for head shaft power requirements should be employed. Where: = Torque (Kg m) = Power CV.Hp or KW) = Head Shaft RPM. = total chain pull. = PCD of Drive sprockets (m) From these two relationships it is concluded.
