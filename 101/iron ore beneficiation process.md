## EmergingTech_BeneficiationprocessforOreExtraction - Vedanta Spark
When the ore is extracted from the mines it is not excavated in the purest form which can be processed. There will be resulting gangue minerals (Mn at 3%) along with the ore concentrate which needs to be refined. This process generates two by-products, which include high grade ore and waste streams. The beneficiation can be done either

## Iron ore crushing and screening process
The iron ore processing and production process mainly includes three processes: crushing, grinding and beneficiation. In the crushing process, the three-stage closed-circuit crushing is more modern and suitable for high-hardness iron ore crushing and can complete the work of ore crushing and partial dissociation, thereby improving the subsequent grinding efficiency.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

## Beneficiation
Beneficiation. In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy, beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals, which results in a higher grade product ( ore concentrate) and a waste stream ( tailings ). There are many different types of beneficiation, with each step

There are many mineral processing methods, and there are two commonly used methods (1). Roasting magnetic separation Roasting magnetic separation is one of the effective methods to separate fine to fine (< 0.02mm) weakly magnetic iron ore. When the minerals in ore are complex and it is difficult to get good indexes by other methods, magnetization roasting magnetic separation should be used.
