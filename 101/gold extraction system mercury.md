July 2, 2015. Fine Gold Recovery, Gold Prospecting, Recent Posts. In the 1800's the use of mercury to extract gold from ore (called Amalgamation) was the most commonly used method by small scale prospectors for this purpose. It has been a highly controversial method of extraction to say the least because of both the physical and environmental

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury

## Gold extraction
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores. The great majority of gold is extracted from dilute ores using a combination of chemical processes.  (1997) mercury was first in use for extraction at about 1000 BC, according to Meech and others (1998), mercury was used in obtaining gold until the latter period

By mixing mercury with crushed ore, even the finest particles of gold could be collected. After heat-treating the resulting slurry, miners could separate the mercury and gold for processing. Gold cyanidation dates back to 1783 when Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered that gold could be dissolved in an aqueous cyanide solution.
