Iron is the backbone of the world we have built around us and it is the basic ingredient of steel (iron plus carbon). Iron is a very useful metal because it can be mixed with other metals to make a whole variety of 'alloys' which are even stronger and don't rust easily and can be shaped into products from cars to pins, household appliances to buildings, bridges to railways, food cans to tools.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

When an iron-containing material oxidizes, its surface layers turn into iron oxide. 16 different types of iron oxide are known, some of which take on a specific color. For this reason, the various iron oxides were used as pigment from the earliest forms of painting and are found in cave paintings thousands of years old. The main iron oxides are:

The term iron ore pellet refers to he thermally agglomerated material formed by heating a variable mixture of iron ore, limestone, olivine, bentonite, dolomite, and miscellaneous iron bearing materials in the range of 1,250 deg C to 1,350 deg C. Iron ore pellets can be made from beneficiated or run of mine iron ore fines.

## Types of Metal and Their Applications | Classification of Metals - Fractory
Classification by Iron Content. The most common way of classifying them is by their iron content. When a metal contains iron, it is known as a ferrous metal. The iron imparts magnetic properties to the material and also makes them prone to corrosion. Metals that do not have any iron content are non-ferrous metals.

History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.
