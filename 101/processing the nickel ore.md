## Commodity Nickel - Everything you need to know about Nickel - Agiboo
The making of nickel is a process which involves a number of steps: 1. Mining. Nickel mined from lateritic ore is mined from various depths beneath the surface using large earth-moving equipment. The other nickel containing type of ore, sulfidic ore, is usually found in combination with copper ore and is mined underground.

## Nickel
Nickel is a silvery-white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish. It is one of only four elements that are magnetic at or near room temperature; the others are iron, cobalt and gadolinium.Its Curie temperature is 355 °C (671 °F), meaning that bulk nickel is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of nickel is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.

## Nickel Heap Leaching - Brazilian Nickel PLC
Nickel Heap Leaching. Heap leaching is a process that extracts valuable metals from ores by dissolving the metals in a solvent. The valuable metals can then be recovered from the solution by a variety of methods. Heap Leaching is an ancient process; leaching metals out of ore goes back nearly 500 years. Mines in Hungary recycled copper-bearing

Cobalt Ores. Nearly all cobalt is found associated with ores of copper, nickel, or copper-nickel. In the copper-cobalt ore bodies of central Africa and Russia, cobalt occurs as sulfides (carrollite, linnaeite, or siegenite), the oxide minerals heterogenite (hydrated cobalt oxide) and asbolite (a mixture of manganese and cobalt oxides), and the carbonate sphaerocobaltite.
