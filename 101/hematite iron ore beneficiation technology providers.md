The process uses coal gas for pre-heating & for partial reduction. Hematite / limonite / goethite ores get converted into magnetite ore in 1-10 minutes depending on the size of iron ore, at temperatures of degree C. The left-over heat, after reduction, is utilized for 3 stage pre-heating of iron ore.

In this figure, the total gangue content was determined as the sum of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 contents in iron ores. All the iron ores were divided into three groups according to the total Fe and gangue content.

## 5 Important Iron Ore Beneficiation Process Introduction
The crystalline fine scaly hematite aggregates with metallic luster are called mica hematite. Hematite Ore. Beneficiation process. Hematite is one of the important iron ore minerals. The ore needs to be selected, the cut-off grade is 25%, and the industrial grade is 28-30%. There are usually 3 hematite beneficiation methods:
