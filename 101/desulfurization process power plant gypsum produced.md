## High quality FGD gypsum with flue gas desulfurization - Eurosilo
The flue gas desulfurization process produces high quality FGD. gypsum. Compared to mined natural gypsum, the industrially produced gypsum is more pure and. therefore offers a wide range of environmentally friendly applications. This turns the output of flue. gas desulfurization into a basic material for industries around the world.

## The desulfurization of flue gas at the Mae Moh Power Plant Units 12 and 
The arrangement and the capacity of all the power plant units are as shown. In 1989, EGAT started the work on the flue gas desulfurization system of Mae Moh power plant units 12 and 13 as planned. A study has been conducted to select the most suitable and most economical process for flue gas desulfurization.

##  Basic Properties of Flue-Gas Desulfurization Gypsum - TUKE
70% gypsum and accordingly 30% water could be produced with our laboratory equipment. A similar strength was measured for composites made of 50% gypsum, 15% fly ash as filler and accordingly 35% water. A 20% decrease in the gypsum content can be the significant in cutting cost if grey colour of the products can be allowed instead of white.
