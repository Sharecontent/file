## Steel Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Steel is typically made in an integrated steel mill (ISM) (see Fig. 16.1), located close to a large river or a deep sea harbour, which typically receives coal and iron ore (oxide, either hematite or magnetite) by ship, usually from far afield, Brazil, Australia or South Africa, for example.
