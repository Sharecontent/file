Particle crushing during compaction is a main cause of size 0-2.5 mm materials, whereas some fine particles are washed away due to the effect of water seepage, which is a main cause of weight loss. Non-Darcy seepage properties of the crushed limestone are strongly influenced by compaction and particle size distribution.

Limestone and chalk enrich soils with lime, which is generally favourable, but there is a marked north-south contrast. The limestone areas of southern France tend to be swept almost bare of soil by erosion; the soil then collects in valleys and hollows. The soils of the higher mountains are naturally stony and unfavourable.
