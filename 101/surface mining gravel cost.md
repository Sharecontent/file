##  Section III: Surface Gravel - US EPA
gravel will often be blamed on the maintenance operator. But the operator cannot make good gravel out of bad gravel. Bad or poorly graded gravel can not be changed to good gravel without additional costs, but it is often well worth it. One common practice of improving surface gravel is to add new, clean, virgin fine gravel. Good surface gravel

Mar 23, 2021Similar to underground mining, Surface mining also has a few upsides and downsides. The most common are: Most of the surface mines recover quickly. About 95 - 100% of mines recover after the mining is done. There are no obstacles to using machines. Miners have the freedom to operate heavy machines. Surface mining is cheaper than underground ming.
