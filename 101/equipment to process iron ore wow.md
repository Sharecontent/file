## equipment is needed for processing iron ore
Equipment for Iron Ore Sintering Process and Steel  Sinter is the primary feed material for making iron in a blast furnace. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the sintering process converts fine-sized raw materials, including iron ore, coke breeze, limestone, mill scale, and flue dust, into an agglomerated product, sinter, of suitable size for charging into the blast
