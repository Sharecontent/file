Crushed stone aggregates are produced by crushing quarried rock, then screening it to sizes appropriate for the intended use. Production of crushed stone has three stages: Primary crushing to break down the stone to a manageable size; secondary and tertiary crushing to render the rocks into sizes specific to their applications; and screening to separate the crushed stone for further processing

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.

Sand and Gravel . Natural sand and gravel is usually dug or dredged from a pit, bank, river, lake or seabed. In most cases, minimal processing is needed beyond washing and screening the material to separate it by particle size. While they share common uses and applications, crushed stone and sand and gravel differ in their physical properties
