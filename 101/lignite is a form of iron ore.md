## Limonite: an iron oxide used as pigment and iron ore - Geology
Limonite has been used by people since prehistoric times. Their first use of limonite was probably as a pigment. It is found in many Neolithic pictographs, and throughout history it has been one of the most important pigments for creating paints in the yellow to brown color range known as ocher. Its use as a pigment continues today.

Lignite contains 25%-35% carbon and has the lowest energy content of all coal ranks. Lignite coal deposits tend to be relatively young and were not subjected to extreme heat or pressure. Lignite is crumbly and has high moisture content, which contributes to its low heating value. Lignite accounted for 9% of total U.S. coal production in 2020.

Lignite, often referred to as brown coal, is a soft, brown, combustible, sedimentary rock formed from naturally compressed peat.It has a carbon content around 25-35%, and is considered the lowest rank of coal due to its relatively low heat content.When removed from the ground, it contains a very high amount of moisture which partially explains its low carbon content.
