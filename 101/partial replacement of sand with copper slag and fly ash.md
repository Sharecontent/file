Copper slag is a waste product of copper extraction by refining. Slag that is extinguished in water produces precise granules which are discarded as waste. Copper slag can be utilized part of concrete creation as a halfway swap for sand. Copper slag is utilized as a building material, shaped into pieces.

In this investigation replacement of fine aggregate with copper slag was done to depict the compressive strength of cubes, flexural strength of beams and split tensile strength of cylinders. The copper slag was added with sand to find out the results of concrete proportion ranging from 5, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%.

Answer (1 of 3): Fly ash has similar properties as CEMENT, it's going to do its work no matter what we think it should be doing. The surface area of fly ash is higher than Fine Aggregate. It requires more cement to coat the extra area due to higher addition of fly ash. If you are using Fly the
