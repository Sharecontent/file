INFOGRAPHICS | March 26. 2020. 6:01. Mapped: The world's coal power plants. Since 2000, the world has doubled its coal-fired power capacity to around 2,045 gigawatts (GW) after explosive growth in China and India. A further 200GW is being built and 300GW is planned. More recently, 268GW has closed due to a wave of retirements across the EU

Countries from around the world are calling for an end to new coal power. During the UN General Assembly, a coalition of seven countries launched the No New Coal Compact in an effort to keep global temperature rise to 1.5°C. The Compact calls on nations to halt the construction of unabated coal-fired power generation projects by the end of this year.

A coal fired power plant is the most inefficient source of energy; it is costly and environmentally hazardous. This is how it works: Firstly the coal is dig from the mines and is supplied to the location where the coal-fired power plant is set up. This supply is made through a highway truck, railways or a barge.
