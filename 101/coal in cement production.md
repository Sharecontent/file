## Cement production | Climate Technology Centre & Network | Tue  - CTCN
Cement is a global commodity, manufactured at thousands of plants. The industry is consolidating globally, but large international firms account for only 30% of the worldwide market. The principal and most visible market for cement is the construction industry in a multitude of applications where it is combined with water to make concrete. Most modern civil engineering projects, office

## Using alternative fuels in cement production - GCPAT
Sep 15, 2020Timber waste. The use of alternative fuels in the manufacture of cement has been growing rapidly, due to the need to find responsible ways to dispose of these materials and due to their economic advantage to the cement producer. Kiln fuel typically represents approximately 25% of clinker production costs, with fossil fuels costing around $100/t.

## Impact of coal shortage on cement price in India - Comaron
Rising Coal Cost Impact on Cement price. Coal is the chief fuel for manufacture of cement in India, by reason of high cost and insufficient availability of oil and gas. The ingesting of coal in dry process system arrays from 20-25% of clinker production. That denotes 0.20-0.25 t of coal is consumed to produce 1 tonne of clinker.

## Emissions from the Cement Industry - State of the Planet
Cement manufacturing is highly energy- and emissions-intensive because of the extreme heat required to produce it. Producing a ton of cement requires 4.7 million BTU of energy, equivalent to about 400 pounds of coal, and generates nearly a ton of CO 2. Given its high emissions and critical importance to society, cement is an obvious place to

## Unavailability of quality coal and lockdown impacts cement production 
The cost escalation of low ash coal is of a serious concern, although there is no change in rate with SMCL coal. Cement plants cannot use SMCL coal alone without blending with low ash coal. The cement plants will suffer from serious implications in a long run if the situation does not improve. The price of coal is almost increasing by 100 percent.
