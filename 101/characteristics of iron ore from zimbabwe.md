## Metal Profile: Iron Properties and Characteristics - ThoughtCo
History . Iron was likely originally discovered and extracted as a result of wood burning on top of iron-containing ores. ﻿ ﻿ The carbon within the wood would have reacted with the oxygen in the ore, leaving behind a soft, malleable iron metal. Iron smelting and the use of iron to make tools and weapons began in Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq) between 2700 and 3000 BCE.

Given the great number and diversity of iron ore deposits, this chapter will deal largely with the mineralogical and geologic characteristics of the most common sources of iron ore, the iron formation-hosted iron ores, and CIDs, with far less attention to all other iron ore deposit types. Table 2.3. Modal mineralogy of some typical iron ores.
