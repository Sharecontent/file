Global coal consumption is estimated to have fallen by 7%, or over 500 million tonnes, between 2018 in 2020. A decline of this size over a two-year period is unprecedented in IEA records, which go back as far as 1971. Based on the assumption of a global economic recovery in 2021, we expect both electricity demand and industrial output to increase.
