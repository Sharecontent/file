Compact Concrete Crushers for non-spec material (jaw or impact) start at $150,000. Small bucket crusher attachments go for a little less but are very slow and lack the ability to separate rebar efficiently. Large closed-circuit tracked impact crushers can go upwards to $750,000 - $1,000,000. Of course, there are numerous options in between.
