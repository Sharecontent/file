## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

1.1 Overview. Nearly 50% of the electricity generated in the world uses coal as the primary fuel. The function of the coal-fired thermal power plant is to convert the energy available in the coal to electricity. Coal power plants work by using several steps to convert stored energy in coal to usable electricity.
