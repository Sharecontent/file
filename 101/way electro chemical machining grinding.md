## What is Electrochemical Grinding and How it Works?
As per the name, it is the metal removal process which is nothing but the combination of the grinding process and electrochemical process. It is also termed as the "electrolytic grinding" and "anodic machining". In this technique, the workpiece plays the role of the anode while the grinding wheel works as a cathode.

## Electrochemical Deburring: Definition, Parts or Construction, Working 
The use of electrochemical machining started in the early 1900s. Experiments were made till 1929. In 1956 electrochemical machining became commercial and the use of electrochemical energy to remove metal became common.  Then the tool has to be designed in such a way that its height should be more than 15 + 2 = 17mm.  Electrochemical

Electrochemical machining is founded on the principles outlined. As shown in Figure 3, the workpiece and tool are the anode and cathode, respectively, of an electrolytic cell, and a constant potential difference, usually at about 10 V, is applied across them.A suitable electrolyte, for example, aqueous sodium chloride (table salt) solution, is chosen so that the cathode shape remains unchanged
