## process of limestone for cement productiona
Slag cement is the byproduct of steel production. It is formed by the molten slag in blast furnaces used to process iron ore to make steel. Finely ground limestone can replace 5% to 15% of portland cement. Portland-limestone cements require less energy to produce because the limestone is not pyroprocessed like the portland cement it replaces.

The Cement Manufacturing Process - CMA India. The cement manufacturing process starts with the mining of limestone that is excavated from open cast mines. Then this limestone is crushed to -80 mm size and is loaded in longitudinal stockpiles. Limestone is taken out diagonally from these stockpiles for grinding in raw mill hoppers.

After crushing, the crushed limestone is piled longitudinally by an equipment called stacker / reclaimer. The stacker deposits limestone longitudinally in the form of a pile. The pile is normally 250 to 300 m long and 8-10 m height. The reclaimer cuts the pile vertically, simultaneously from top to bottom to ensure homogenization of limestone.
