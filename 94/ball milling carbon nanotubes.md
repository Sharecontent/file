## Pulmonary and systemic responses of highly pure and well-dispersed 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are fiber-shaped substances that consist of graphite hexagonal mesh planes (gra-phene sheets) in a single layer or as multiple layers with nest accumulation.  Muller et al. (2005) reported that MWCNTs ground by a ball mill (average tube length: 0.7 Î¼m) induced greater inflammation than non-ground bulk MWCNTs

Applications of conducting polymers: 1. Conducting polymers are useful in discharging large quantities of static electricity in computer industries and in chemical industries. This can be accomplished by coating the conducting polymer over an insulating surface. Hence conducting polymers are used as antistatics. 2.

Ball Milling of Multiwalled Carbon Nanotubes. As the length of the carbon nanotubes is thousands of times larger than their width, ball milling of MWCNTs is a common procedure to generate short and open-ended nanotubes. Ball milling apparatus consists of tungsten carbide lined bowls containing tungsten carbide lined ball.

## Ball milling effect on the structure of single-wall carbon nanotubes 
Ball milling is regularly applied to carbon materials. Applying graphite, it was used to produce highly curved nanostructures [1], [2], to insert lithium [3] or to improve the hydrogen storage capacity of the material [4], [5]. In this paper, we propose to use this grinding method on single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).

## BallâMilling Modification of SingleâWalled Carbon Nanotubes 
Ball-Milling Modification of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: Purification, Cutting, and Functionalization. Noelia Rubio,  Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) can be successfully cut with relatively homogeneous sizes using a planetary mill. The optimized conditions produce highly dispersible SWNTs that can be efficiently functionalized in

## Effect of ball-milling time on mechanical properties of carbon 
Microstructure and its evolution of the mixture powders and the fabricated composites were Received in revised form 23 July 2012 examined and the mechanical properties of the composites were tested. It was indicated that the CNTs Accepted 28 July 2012 were gradually dispersed into the Al matrix as ball-milling time increased and ac

Mechanical ball milling The particle size of the carbon material has a greater relationship with its charge and discharge performance.  Carbon nanotubes are mixed with graphite and form nano-scale micropores with graphite to increase the space for intercalation of Li and increase its reversible capacity to 341.8mAÂ·h/g, and the doped carbon
