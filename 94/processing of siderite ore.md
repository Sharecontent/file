## Direct Reduction of Siderite Ore Combined with Catalytic CO/CO2 
processing of siderite ore is challenging. The state-of-the-art process is based on a two-step route with calcination in a sinter plant and consecutive reduction in the blast furnace. In the first step, siderite is calcinated in air to release CO 2 and form hematite (Fe 2O 3, Eq.(1)). In the second step,
