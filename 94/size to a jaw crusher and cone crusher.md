## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Selecting the right crusher for your operations - Quarry
Best suited for secondary crushing applications, cone crushers are designed to crush pre-sized materials, usually 100mm, 150mm or 200mm, depending on the size of the crusher. Cone crushers can form finished products down to 12mm or less. Like the jaw crusher, the cone crusher provides a relatively low cost crushing solution, but there are

## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
The price of the cone crusher is much more expensive and its capacity is stronger than a jaw crusher of the same gape. For example, if your material is 250mm, you want better processing capacity with an adequate budget, you'd better choose the cone crusher because its capacity can be 85-170 t/h, while jaw crusher only 16-105 t/h.

## Jaw Crushers | McLanahan
As a rule, Jaw Crushers have a 6:1 or 8:1 ratio for crushing material. Still using the 32 x 54 Jaw Crusher example, the top size of the feed entering the crushing chamber has to follow the F80 rule that 80% of the top size feed material is smaller than the gape opening.
