Limestone is a type of sedimentary rock containing 10% of all rocks. Limestone is chiefly containing calcium in various chemical formats including calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and known as Calcite in the geological term. However, common people hardly familiar with professional terminology so it is better to simplify it.
