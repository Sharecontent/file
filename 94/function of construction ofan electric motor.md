An electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft. An electric generator is mechanically identical to an electric motor, but operates with a reversed

## What is Electric Motor? Definition & Types - Circuit Globe
A machine that converts the DC electrical power into mechanical power is known as DC motor. Its work depends on the basic principle that when a current carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, then a force exerted on it, and torque develops. The DC motor is classified into two types, i.e., the self-excited motor and separately excited.

The stator is the fixed part of an electrical machine that. Together with the rotor, it is a fundamental element to transmit electric current (in the case of electric generators) or power in the case of electric motors. By electric machine we mean both electric motors and electric generators. The moving part of an electric motor is called a rotor.

The electric motor is the main element of the electric drive. In some operating modes of the electric drive, the electric motor performs the reverse energy conversion, that is, it operates in the mode of an electric generator. By the type of created mechanical motion, electric motors are divided into rotating, linear, etc.

Cooling is necessary to continuously transfer the heat to a cooling medium, such as the air. The different methods of cooling rotating machines are classified in the standards IEC 34.6 and AS 1359.21. For AC induction motors, cooling air is usually circulated internally and externally by one or more fans mounted on the rotor shaft.
