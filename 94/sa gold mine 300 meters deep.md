Increasing demand for metals caused by global economic growth and exploitation of shallow mineral deposits forces mineral extraction to go deeper. A direct consequence of this development is an increase in rock pressure-related mining problems. The role of rock engineering in the design and operation of deep mines is discussed in detail. Critical issues are the rock fracturing around mining
