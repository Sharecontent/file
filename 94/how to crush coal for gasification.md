## Coal Gasification Pros and Cons - HRF
The Pros of Coal Gasification. The introduction of process for utilizing coal has brought a number of advantages which include the following: 1. The core of gasification lies in the gasifier that takes water, air and coal applying heat under pressure in order to produce syngas, which is the mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide.

## How To Crush Coal For Gasification
Coal is first crushed and sometimes dried, then fed into gasifier, in which coal reacts with steam and either air or oxygen. The gasification reaction usually occurs at high temperatures from 800 to 1900 C and high pressure up to 10 MPa.
