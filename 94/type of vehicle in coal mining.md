In particular, surface mining is used to retrieve sand, gravel, stones, coal, iron and other metals. There are five recognized types of surface mining, each with specific variations depending on the minerals being extracted. These include strip mining, open-pit mining, mountaintop removal, dredging and highwall mining.

When a coal seam is too deep to efficiently mine the coal from the surface, underground mining techniques are used. The underground method of coal mining currently utilizes two main techniques: room and pillar mining, and longwall mining 1. Room and pillar mining involves cutting a system of rooms within the coal seem.
