CESL Gold Process. Gold and Silver Value in Copper Concentrates Gold and silver occurring in copper sulphide ores generally follow the copper into the flotation concentrate in fairly high yield and, given current precious metal prices, the amount of gold and silver required to be economically significant is quite low.

## gold processing - Refining | Britannica
Gold extracted by amalgamation or cyanidation contains a variety of impurities, including zinc, copper, silver, and iron. Two methods are commonly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more readily than gold does at temperatures equal to or

As expected, the copper in the circuit reduced to a low level, but when sulfide copper-gold ore processing resumed, the copper concentration in the leach circuit did not attain previous levels even though a higher copper orebody was being mined. The copper recovery plant was operated intermittently for a few months and was eventually shut down.

Once a concentrate has been produced containing copper and other metals of value (such as gold and silver), the next step is to remove impurity elements.

## Copper Processing | Multotec
Copper processing begins with mining copper ore, which contains less than 1% of copper, and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper (cathodes). Copper mining generally takes place through open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper into the earth. Yet, it can also be mined underground, through horizontal tunnels.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## Copper and Gold - Comparison - Properties - Material Properties
Gold is used extensively in jewellery, either in its pure form or as an alloy. About 75% of all gold produced is used in the jewelry industry. Pure gold is too soft to stand up to the stresses applied to many jewelry items. Craftsmen learned that alloying gold with other metals such as copper, silver, and platinum would increase its durability.
