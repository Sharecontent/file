Primary world nickel production in 2020 was 2430.7 kt Ni; 69% (1677.7 kt) of them came from oxidized nickel ores (laterites) and 31% from sulfides. Production-wise, 87.7% of the 1677.7 kt came from pyrometallurgical and 12.3% from hydrometallurgical processes. For a long time, Fe-Ni had a 20-40% Ni analysis, but in 2006 a new Fe-Ni quality came into the scene.

Since direct reduction takes place entirely in the solid phase and preferably up to 95% - 97% reduction, LKAB has introduced the following concepts as measures of reducibility in isothermal reduction: t95 = time required to reach 95% reduction, expressed in minutes. R40 = rate of oxygen loss at 40% reduction, expressed in % O/min.

## Direct reduced iron
Direct reduced iron (DRI), also called sponge iron, is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore (in the form of lumps, pellets, or fines) into iron by a reducing gas or elemental carbon produced from natural gas or coal.Many ores are suitable for direct reduction. Direct reduction refers to solid-state processes which reduce iron oxides to metallic iron at temperatures below the melting

## direct reduction of nickel
Oct 01, 2020· A coal-based direct reduction process was used to reduce the nickel laterite ore under a constant C: O ratio (1.2: 1) and reduction time (90 min). The effect of basicity and reduction temperature on microstructure and reduction characteristics and of carbon-bearing nickel laterite ore pellets was investigated.

## DRI production | International Iron Metallics Association
DRI production. Direct reduction of iron is the removal of oxygen from iron ore or other iron bearing materials in the solid state, i.e. without melting, as in the blast furnace. The reducing agents are carbon monoxide and hydrogen, coming from reformed natural gas, syngas or coal. Iron ore is used mostly in pellet and/or lumpy form.
