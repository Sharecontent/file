## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.
