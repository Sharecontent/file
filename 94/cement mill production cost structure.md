## Cement Plant Cost Influencing Elements - Cement Factory Cost | AGICO
Power and fuel are the primary cost of cement production (about 30% of the total cost). Among them, electricity and coal as the main energy consumption have a direct impact on the running of the cement plant. The electricity is used in many stages from raw material crushing to clinker grinding. It supports the operating of the whole cement

## How cement companies create value: The five elements of a successful 
It's no secret that cement companies continually struggle to generate returns on invested capital (ROIC) greater than their cost of capital. (See "The cement industry at a turning point," on McKinsey, December 2015.)That chronic underperformance stems in part from structural factors such as large fixed costs and fluctuations in supply and demand.

## Use Cement Ball Mill Grinding Cement Clinker | Cement Ball Mill Operation
The cement ball mill operation is more practical and the energy-saving effect is better. In terms of production capacity, the output of cement ball mill produced by us can be increased by 15% - 20% compared with the one made by other cement ball mill manufacturers, while the power consumption is reduced by 10%.

## Cement mill
A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.
