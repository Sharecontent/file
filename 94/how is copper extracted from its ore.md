Feb 22, 2022According to the copper mineral embedding characteristics, the raw ores are grinded to 50-70% under 200 meshes. A large number of tailings are discarded in roughing and scavenging. Through the roughing concentrates grinding, the copper concentrates can be required two or three times of concentrating.

(ii) Copper matte contains Cu 2 S and FeS. In the blast furnace, copper matte is added with powdered coke and silica. The oxidation of ore takes place in this process. As a result, cuprous oxide and ferrous oxide are produced. The role of silica in this process is to remove the iron oxide obtained as 'slag'.

## Copper mining. From ore to copper..uk
About 80% of all copper extracted comes from sulphide ores. A typical ore contains only 0.5% to 2.0% copper. It is a measure of the value of copper that it is worth extracting it from such small concentrations. The ore is a mixture of minerals and rock (called gangue). The most common copper minerals are:

Copper is extracted in large amounts from the Earth's crust by mining of sulphide ores and also oxide ores. Studies reveal about 80% of copper is produced by its extraction from sulphide ores. Chalcopyrite is a certain kind of suphide ore that can be converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores

The barren rock, or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore. By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper, iron and sometimes other metals. Such ores originate from sulfur-bearing volcanic magmas, which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.
