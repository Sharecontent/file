## environmental effects of iron mining - Welcome to Tables & Thyme
Open-pit mines can create several environmental problems common to other iron- mining methods, including AMD, soil contamination, and destruc- tion of vegetation. However, air pollution by fugitive dust—from tailings, waste rock, overburden, and ore piles—is an environmental impact closely associated with open-pit mining.

## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry?
Mining adversely affects the environment by inducing loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, and contamination of surface water, groundwater, and soil. Mining can also trigger the formation of sinkholes. The leakage of chemicals from mining sites can also have detrimental effects on the health of the population living at or around the mining site.

## Positive and Negative Effects of Mining
Mining Contributes To Global Warming. Natural resources extracted through mining contribute heavily to global warming. Coal and oil are burned to power cars and our electric grid, releasing dangerous CO2 into the environment. Beyond being fueling these processes, mining itself creates a lot of pollution.

But hydraulic mining was still widely used in placer gold mines on Alaska in the early 20 th century. Today, hydraulic gold mining is only rarely practiced on an industrial scale, but gold mines on Alaska sometimes use it. It survives mostly in artisanal form in remote, undeveloped and largely unregulated areas of the world.

## The Potential Negative Effects Of Mining On The Environment, Animals 
In some countries, mining is responsible for significant amounts of water use, as well as water waste. Environmentally, potential negative effects of mining can include air, land/soil and water pollution of different kinds. Mining produces potentially hazardous/toxic tailing waste, and can leach toxic chemicals, heavy metals and air pollutants.
