## How to Use an Angle Grinder Tool (DIY) | Family Handyman
Mount a metal cutoff wheel in your angle grinder. Prop up the long side of the rebar and hold it securely. Drop the cutoff wheel through the metal, allowing the weight of the tool to do most of the work. Allow the short end to drop freely to avoid binding the blade. If you're patient, you can cut most metal with a hacksaw.

## What Causes Angle Grinder Accidents & How To Prevent?

It happens when the tool grabs or jams on the cutting materials, then forcing back towards the operator. This accident leads to severe hand injury or hurts to arms, hands, legs, neck, face, or the groin region.

## How To Use a Lathe - American Machine Tools
General machine practice is to use a depth of cut up to five times the rate of feed, such as rough cutting stainless steel using a feed of 0.020 inch per revolution and a depth of cut of 0.100 inch, which would reduce the diameter by 0.200 inch. If chatter marks or machine noise develops, reduce the depth of cut.
