## Iron Ore Processing Explained - Mining-pedia
Aug 31, 2021The specific process of iron ore processing is as follows: iron ore is gradually separated from iron after crushing, screening, grinding, classifying, magnetic separation, flotation, gravity separation, roasting reduction, filtration, and dehydration. Thus, a mineral aggregate containing iron element or iron compound that can be used

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
