Barite is a Sulfate mineral. Sulfates are a group of minerals whose crystal structure has four Oxygen atoms forming a square with a Sulfur atom in the center. There are approximately 200 types of Sulfates, with Gypsum and Barite being very common and the rest being quite rare. Barite is usually white, but it can also be blue or green.
