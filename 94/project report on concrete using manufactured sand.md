## Manufactured Sand for Construction - Structural Guide
Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is used as a substitution to the river sand in construction. River sand is becoming a decaying resource in some parts of the year due to the lack of rains to collect the sand on the river beds. Manufactured sand can be considered as a by-product of the process of producing coarse aggregates.
