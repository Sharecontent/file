##  Research into Artificial Limestone Composites with Cotton Waste
limestone powder waste and cotton waste composites having low thermal conductivity can reduce energy requirements. A strong relationship is also found among the thermal conductivity, unit weight and ultrasonic  the specimens are as small as those of common brick materials used in buildings. There is no significant reduction in the thermal

## Cotton and Limestone Powder Wastes as Brick Material
The majority of cotton wastes (CW) and limestone powder wastes (LPW) is abandoned, and causes certain serious environmental problems and health hazards. This paper presents a parametric
