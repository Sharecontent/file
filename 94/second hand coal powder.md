## Why Pulverized Coal is Used in a Power Plant
Modern boilers powder the coal to a very fine dust so that while burning, it is almost like a fluid stream. The size of the coal particles is in the range of 75 microns. This means every particle comes into contact with the air. The loss due to unburned carbon is only in the range of 0.5 % or less making the boilers very efficient.

## Coal Mill in Cement Plant | Vertical Roller Mill & Air-Swept Ball Mill
The ball mill is a traditional coal pulverizer machine, which has been widely used since it was invented. In the cement plant, the new dry process cement manufacturing requires the moisture content of coal powder to be 0.5% ~ 1.5%, while that of raw coal is 1.5% ~ 4.0%. Therefore, the ball mill should have a drying function besides grinding.

Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was
