## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

The First Open Pit Mining Site - The Jackson Mine. Discovering iron ore was easier than mining it. This first open pit mine in the Lake Superior region started as a mountain of ore 150 feet high. Workers began prying ore from the surface with a bar and pick. Later they hand- drilled holes and filled them with explosives to fracture the ore body.
