## Why is Australia still opening coal mines? | The Lighthouse
Old energy: Australia is opening coal mines, while countries such as Germany are closing them down. And yet, while the rest of the world is looking at transitioning away from fossil-fuels such as coal to renewables (Germany is in the process of closing down all its 84 coal-fired power plants), Australia is still opening new mines.

How big a deal is this particular mine, and the future CO2 emissions from the coal mined there? This mine would produce 168 million tonnes of coal over the next 25 years. Over its lifetime, the mine would be responsible for 370 million tonnes of carbon dioxide - for context that is two-thirds of all of Australia's emissions from 2019.
