## Plastic pollution
Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g. plastic bottles, bags and microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat. Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, making them very adaptable for different uses; as a result

The industry is four times more polluting than air travel. Making it more sustainable is critical to protecting our health and the climate. Concrete mixing machines line up at the construction site for high-rise buildings on April 10 in Kolkata, India. Buildings of the future will be grown on-site, says Wil Srubar.

Effect on Water System: New storm-drainage systems reduce flooding during storms. Less damage is done to basements, yards, and streets. Water is actually injected into recharge wells to put water back into underground aquifers. Reusing wastewater means less pollution, more water conservation, and additional water for recharging aquifers.
