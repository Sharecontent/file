## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview - IntechOpen
Iron ore and iron ore pellets are important sources of iron for manufacturing steel. The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries, such as China and India. However, the content of iron ore in deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed.

## Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process - IspatGuru
Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production. For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely, the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process. In the STG process, a stationary bed of pellets is

The blast furnace process is primarily used in the carbothermic reduction of oxides, such as iron, zinc, and lead. Most of the iron ore bodies commercially explored consist of iron oxides. Consequently, rich iron ore and/or iron oxide pellets formed from concentrate can be added directly to a blast furnace (see Iron Production).

## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes
Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %). Normally pellets are reduced considerably faster than sinter

## Iron ore pellets as a solution to steel—making raw materials at the 
Under the scenario as discussed earlier, production and use of iron ore pellets provide a viable solution to steel-making raw materials at the present cross road. Pellets are also considered the dominant constituent of basket of iron ores available for export in future. This is based on the premise that there are huge stacks of fines of minus

## USB1 - Production of iron ore pellets - Google Patents
A process for producing fired pellets by granulating finely-ground iron ore and subjecting the resulting granules sequentially to drying, dehydration, preheating, and firing, wherein said process comprises adding an additive to said finely-ground iron ore at the time of granulation, said additive reacting with iron ore to form a compound which has a melting point lower than the preheating
