Definition of fine grinding. Fine grinding is usually performed in a mill rotating on a horizontal axis and containing balls, rods, or pebbles (grinding media), which serve to grind the ore in the mill. The different mills used in fine grinding are known as ball mill, pebble mill, Hardinge mill, tube mill, autogenous, etc. Ref: Newton, 1.
