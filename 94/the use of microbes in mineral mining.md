## Bioleaching: metal solubilization by microorganisms
Bioleaching is a simple and effective technology for metal extraction from low-grade ores and mineral concentrates. Metal recovery from sulfide minerals is based on the activity of chemolithotrophic bacteria, mainly Thiobacillus ferrooxidans and T. thiooxidans, which convert insoluble metal sulfides into soluble metal sulfates. Non-sulfide ores

## Heavy Metal Mining Using Microbes | Annual Review of Microbiology
Abstract. Abstract The use of acidiphilic, chemolithotrophic iron- and sulfur-oxidizing microbes in processes to recover metals from certain types of copper, uranium, and gold-bearing minerals or mineral concentrates is now well established. During these processes insoluble metal sulfides are oxidized to soluble metal sulfates.

Microbes interacted with minerals for billions of years before multicellular organisms started to evolve. A better understanding of the mineral microbiome and its mechanisms of mineralisation and solubilisation could help with the exploration, production and ultimate recycling of mineral resources.
