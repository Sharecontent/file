The type of bulk feed bins we are talking about are most popular with farmers and ranchers who have poultry houses, pig houses, horse barns and dairy barns. Adding a bulk feed bin system will increase productivity in a poultry or livestock operation because they provide the ability to monitor the feed intake of each animal or group.Bulk feed.. best waterless car wash for ceramic coating

## Gyratory Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gyratory crusher shown in Figure 2.6 employs a crushing head, in the form of a truncated cone, mounted on a shaft, the upper end of which is held in a flexible bearing, whilst the lower end is driven eccentrically so as to describe a circle. The crushing action takes place round the whole of the cone and, since the maximum movement is at the bottom, the characteristics of the machine are

## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Cone crushers were originally designed and developed by Symons around 1920 and therefore are often described as Symons cone crushers. As the mechanisms of crushing in these crushers are similar to gyratory crushers their designs are similar, but in this case the spindle is supported at the bottom of the gyrating cone instead of being suspended as in larger gyratory crushers.

The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the following ranges are common for cone crushers: 6:1 - 8:1 for secondaries 4:1 - 6:1 for tertiary and quaternary crushing.
