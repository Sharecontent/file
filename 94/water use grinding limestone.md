## water use grinding limestone
Jan 13, 2022An acid soil reacts slowly with limestone because limestone is not very water soluble. Grinding limestone finer improves its solubility and speeds up reaction with soil. When limestone reacts with soil, acidity (or hydrogen ions) is removed. Hydrogen attached to the clay is exchanged with calcium from the soluble limestone.

## How To Mine Limestone - Realonomics
How To Mine Limestone? Limestone is extracted from the rock either by blasting or mechanical excavation depending on the hardness of the rock. rough crushing. After crushing the stone is sorted into different fractions by screening after which it goes to be processed further. In the grinding process the limestone is ground to a fine powder.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Even very pure calcium carbonate (limestone) is not very soluble in water, so it must be finely ground to effectively neutralize soil acid. While grinding finer increases effectiveness, this also increases cost and drift loss. To avoid drift, many quarries will only grind limestone to an average of 30 mesh.
