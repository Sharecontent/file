6. The Empire Mine tailings waste was generated from a magnetite ore by a magnetic separation process. This waste, with an initial solids content of 46% and a residual concentration of thickening aid, quickly developed an interface during settling tests and subsequently settled as a hindered suspension.

## Iron Ore: From Mining to Processing to Dust Control
Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## How to generate value from tailings with reprocessing to be future 
A standard method of reprocessing involves dragging tailings from an existing dam back to the concentrator and using required mineral processing solutions to liberate the valuable metals. The discarded tailings are then dewatered and dry stacked, and the water recycled within the plant or properly disposed back to nature.

## Taconite Iron Ore Processing: National Emission Standards for  - US EPA
Apr 5, 2022A taconite iron ore processing facility separates and concentrates iron ore from taconite, a low-grade iron ore, and produces taconite pellets, which are approximately 60 percent iron and about ½ inch in diameter. These pellets are then utilized, mainly, in blast furnaces making iron and steel and in the cement industry. Rule History
