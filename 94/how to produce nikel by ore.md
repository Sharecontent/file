Nickel. Nickel is a silver metal with a slight golden tinge with the symbol Ni and is atomic number 28. Nickel occurs mostly in combination with sulfur and iron. The commodity Nickel can only be economically mined from two types of ore deposits, the first one being laterites and the second being magmatic sulfide.

Ore grade has a direct effect on mine investment costs expressed in US$ per annual tonne of nickel. Consider two identical ore bodies, one containing 1.25% Ni ore and the other containing 2.5% Ni ore. Achievement of an identical annual production of nickel in ferronickel requires that the 1.25% Ni ore be mined at twice the rate of the 2.5% Ni ore.

What is Nickel Ore? Nickel ore is an ore of nickel that is used as the source of nickel in the production of ferrous and non-ferrous alloys. As such, it is an important mineral in the mining industry. Nickel ore is generally extracted from sulfide ore deposits. The nickel content may vary from less than 1% (low grade) to 65% or more (high grade).

Nickel ore is an uncommon ore that yields nickel and small amounts of platinum. Obtaining. Nickel ore is about as common as gold ore, but it occurs at fewer levels (layers 5-20). Veins of nickel ore are also relatively small. Nickel ore must be mined with an iron pickaxe or better. If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.
