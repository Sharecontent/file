## Excess air in boilermeforyou.shop
Lower excess air levels starve the reaction for oxygen, and higher excess air levels drive down the flame temperature, slowing the rate of reaction. NOx reduction is the area of most concern today. Thermally produced NOx is the largest contributor to these types of emissions.  NOx in boiler > burners can be reduced with either pre-combustion.

## Pulverized coal-fired boiler
A pulverized coal-fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.. The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.
