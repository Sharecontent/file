## What is open pit coal mining?f
How does open pit coal mining work? Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.  To create an open-pit mine, the miners must determine the information of the ore that is underground. This is done through drilling of probe holes in the ground, then plotting each hole location on a map.

The two mining methods used in coal extraction are surface "Open Pit" mining and Underground mining. Simply put, surface mining is peeling back the earth and collecting coal near the surface. Whereas, underground mining requires tunneling and building shafts. The mining method chosen by companies depends on the coal deposit being extracted.
