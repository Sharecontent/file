The diamond cutting process involves marking, cleaving and/or sawing, bruiting, faceting, and placing and polishing. Marking. The first step of the diamond cutting process is marking the stone. A planner examines each uncut diamond to decide how it can be cut to maximize its value. After a thorough examination of the imperfections and how they.
