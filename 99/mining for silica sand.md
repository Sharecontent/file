Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.

Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). Silica sand deposits are most commonly surface-mined in open pit operations, but dredging and underground mining are also employed.

A mined silica sand site. Figure 4. The ravenous topography resulted from large scale open cast mining. sand falls by gravity to the bottom. After washing, the sand is then sent to a surge pile where water adhering to the sand particles infiltrates back into the ground. From the surge pile the sand is sent to the dryer and screening.
