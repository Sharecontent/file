## Solvometallurgy: An Emerging Branch of Extractive Metallurgy
This position paper introduces the reader to the concept of solvometallurgy, the term used to describe the extraction of metals from ores, industrial process residues, production scrap, and urban waste using non-aqueous solutions. Here, non-aqueous is not used to imply anhydrous, but rather a low water content. The unit operations are as follows: solvent leaching; separation of the residue

The SX/EW Process is a hydrometallurgical process since it operates at ambient temperatures and the copper is in either an aqueous environment or an organic environment during its processing until it is reduced to the metal. Because of its dependence on sulfuric acid, the SX/EW Process is at present not a substitute for, but rather an adjunct

## Copper Extraction Techniques - Hydrometallurgical Extraction - Oxide Ores
Such oxide ores are usually leached by sulfuric acid, usually in a heap leaching or dump leaching process to liberate the copper minerals into a solution of sulfuric acid laden with copper sulfate in solution. The copper sulfate solution (the pregnant leach solution) is then stripped of copper via a solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX-EW
