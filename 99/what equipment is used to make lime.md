Plasters made of hydrated lime are less brittle and less prone to breakage, which does not require expansion joints. The high pH of lime acts as a fungicide preventing mold from growing in the lime plasters. Disadvantages of lime plaster: Hydraulic lime plaster is not as hard as cement plaster. When the plaster dries, the pH drops to about 8.6.

## Lime (material)
Lime is a calcium-containing inorganic material composed primarily of oxides, and hydroxide, usually calcium oxide and/or calcium hydroxide.It is also the name for calcium oxide which occurs as a product of coal-seam fires and in altered limestone xenoliths in volcanic ejecta. The International Mineralogical Association recognizes lime as a mineral with the chemical formula of CaO.

## Lime and its Production
Combining Quicklime (CaO) and water (H20) produces Calcium Hydroxide (Ca (OH)2 - slaked lime and heat. There are three main ways of slaking the Quicklime: in a shortfall of water to produce a powder - hydrated or bag lime; in damp sand to produce a hot mix. Lime sets by absorbing water soluble Carbon Dioxide from the air.
