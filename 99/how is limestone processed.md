## A Look Into Carving Limestone
Limestone originates in the ocean, and is composed mostly of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate appears chalky and powdery, and gives limestone its malleable qualities. Because limestone is such a soft yet durable stone, it's ideal for carving! The Carving Process. Limestone is soft enough that it's relatively easy to carve.

## Influence of limestone waste as partial replacement material for sand 
Limestone waste is obtained as a by-product during the production of aggregates through the crushing process of rocks in rubble crusher units. Using quarry waste as a substitute of sand in construction materials would resolve the environmental problems caused by the large-scale depletion of the natural sources of river and mining sands.
