## Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding - 2 Amazing Grinding Method  - Milkwood
The primary advantage of using a wet grinde r instead of a dry grinder is cost. A typical wet grinder costs around $10,000-$20,000 compared to an average price tag of $50,000-$100,000 for a comparable dry grinder. This difference comes largely because wet grinders don't require expensive high-speed motors, bearings, seals, lubrication systems

## Fundamentals of OD Grinding - Metal Cutting Corporation
Despite the name, OD grinding is not just about shaping the outside diameter (OD) of a part. As a type of cylindrical grinding, it requires that the object being ground has a central axis of rotation. In fact, OD grinding occurs on the external surface of a workpiece between the centers — and that is a critical distinction.
