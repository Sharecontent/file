## Use Range and Attentions of Gyratory Crusher - Luoyang Dahua
The gyratory crusher is a large crusher which makes use of the gyratory movement of the crushing cone in the inner cone cavity to extrude, split and bend the material for various kinds of rocks and stones. Gyratory crusher is a typical coarse crushing equipment in a large mineral dressing plant. Both gyratory crusher and jaw crusher can be used as coarse crushing machinery.

## Types of Crushers: What You Need to Know - Machinery Partner
The Gates' gyratory crushers were preferred by the mining industry for almost two decades until the turn of the century, circa 1910, when Blake's jaw crushers saw a resurgence in popularity. The demand for large-mouthed jaw crushers skyrocketed as the industry began to understand their potential as primary crushers in rock quarries.

The gyratory crusher can, just like a jaw crusher, accept boulder sizes close to 1.5 m (for the largest equipment). - This crusher can handle products with a Mohs hardness that is not necessarily less than 5. - As is the case for jaw crushers, there is not any mutual sliding on grinding surfaces, but simply rolling of the nut on concaves.
