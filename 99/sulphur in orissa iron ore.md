##  Beneficiation Studies on Iron Ores From Orissa
The ore is to be upgraded to about 65% Fe, in connection with a new trade agreement being negotiated for export of iron ore to Japan. The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.
