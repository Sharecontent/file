## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

Gyratory crushers and cone crushers, while looking the same and performing similar duties, are two different machines.A quick look at a machine will allow you to determine if it is a gyratory or a cone In simple terms, if you look at the top of the crusher and it has supporting arms ("spider arms") going out to the centre of the machine (normally 2 or 3) it's a gyratory.

## Choosing the Right Rock Crushing Equipment - Amcast
Gyratory Crusher. A gyratory crusher consists of a concave surface and a conical head constructed from heavy steel casting. It works by using a mantle that gyrates within a concave bowl. This rock crushing equipment uses compressive force to fracture the rock and this happens when the mantle makes contact with the bowl during gyration.

Cone Crushers; Typically, the initial crushing stage is completed using either gyratory crushers or jaw crushers. It is often the case that there will be only one crusher installed, and this will be referred to as the 'Primary Crusher'. Cone crushers are typically used for 2 nd, 3 rd & 4 th stage crushing steps (although not always).
