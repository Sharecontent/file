## Coal gas
Coal gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made from coal and supplied to the user via a piped distribution system. It is produced when coal is heated strongly in the absence of air. Town gas is a more general term referring to manufactured gaseous fuels produced for sale to consumers and municipalities.. The original coal gas was produced by the coal gasification reaction, and thus the burnable

What is Underground coal gasification? The process involves pumping oxygen and steam through a small borehole into the coal seam to produce a small and controlled combustion. Unlike coal-bed methane, therefore, the actual coal is converted from a solid state into gas. The hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and CO2 are then siphoned off through

Coal gasification is a thermo-chemical process in which heat and pressure break down coal into its basic chemical constituents. The resulting "syngas" is comprised primarily of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and occasionally other gaseous compounds. Syngas can be used for electricity production, used in energy-efficient fuel cell technology

## Coal Gasification - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal gasification can also be carried out on seams that are still in place, the coal being converted to gaseous fuels without an intermediate mining operation. This process, known as in situ or underground gasification, typically involves drilling boreholes to intersect the seam in at least two places, and providing a passage for gas through the seam from one intersection to the other.

Gasification is a commercial technology that can convert any material containing carbonâ€”such as coal, petroleum coke (petcoke), biomass or wasteâ€”into synthesis gas (syngas).. Syngas can be burned to produce electricity or further processed to manufacture chemicals, fertilisers, liquid fuels, substitute natural gas (SNG) or hydrogen..

Charcoal gasifiers are considered updraft gasifiers. Meaning the air is brought in form the bottom of the reactor, burned and the escaping gases are vented through the media (unburned charcoal) and out the top of the reactor. Charcoal is also extremely dusty. Dust particles can hitch a ride on the outbound gases and find its way into your engine.
