## Gravity Concentration Separation
Gravity Separation Concentration Glautocoa. Gravity concentration is the separation of minerals based on differences in specific gravity. A gravity concentration process is designed to recover very high grades of valuable ore material into very small masses. The resurgence of gravity concentration in mining has come about due to its simplicity

The separation effect of heavy medium gravity separation is mainly determined by the density of the ore particles, and the influence of the size and shape of the ore particles is small, so the separation precision is relatively high, the minerals with a small difference in density (such as 0.1 g/cm3) can be well separated.
