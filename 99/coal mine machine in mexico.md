Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

Humate is either weathered coal or organic-rich mudstone that is found in a coal-bearing sequence. Humate is primary used as a soil additive or as a drilling mud additive. The important factors in determining humate quality are the amounts of humic and fulvic acid. Several humate mines are located in the San Juan Basin.

Coal mines operated without electricity. Electricity began to be adopted in mining and manufacturing in the late 1880s and the 1890s. (Electricity was first introduced into Ohio's bituminous coal mines in 1889.) The introduction of electricity in coal mines greatly facilitated the introduction of laborsaving machinery. 1891.
