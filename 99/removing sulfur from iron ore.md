## Why iron sulphide is a compound?f
Score: 5/5 (56 votes) . Iron and sulfur are both elements from the periodic table of elements.  When these two are heated together, the iron atoms combine with the sulfur atoms to make a compound known as iron sulphide. A compound is different from elements in that it is made from the chemical union of two or more elements.
