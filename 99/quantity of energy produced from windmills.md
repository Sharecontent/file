## The power from windmills - ecolo
The power produced by a windmill is given by the following formula: Power produced by a windmill (in Watts) = C (constant) x k (efficiency factor) x (Diameter of the windmill in meters)2 x (Speed of the wind in m/s)3. This formula is proportional to the square of the diameter of the propellers, which helps us to understand why modern windmills

On average, therefore, wind turbines do not generate near their capacity. Industry estimates project an annual output of 30-40%, but real-world experience shows that annual outputs of 15-30% of capacity are more typical. With a 25% capacity factor, a 2-MW turbine would produce. 2 MW × 365 days × 24 hours × 25% = 4,380 MWh = 4,380,000 kWh.

During the early days of modern wind turbines the argument was simple and appealing. Every kWh electric energy generated by wind replaces a kWh produced by a conventional power plant. As a result the fuel needed to produce it, is saved and the CO 2 that would be produced is not released in the earth's atmosphere.

## How Many Wind Turbines Can Fit On One Acre? - Semprius
Wind Turbine Spacing. Wind turbines need to be spaced appropriately to maximize efficiency. In order to produce electricity, wind turbines need a steady flow of wind, which necessitates a lack of obstacles.This includes other wind turbines. The turbines extract energy from the wind and create an area of turbulence in the immediate area. Wind turbines that are spaced too closely will be less

## Wind Energy Explained - Knowledge Bank - Solar Schools
Wind energy is a clean energy source. Once installed, wind energy farms produce no air pollutants or greenhouse gases, so the impact on the environment is only minor compared to other forms of energy production. Wind power is inexhaustible. The wind blows day and night, which allows wind turbines to produce electricity throughout both the day

## Overblown: Wind turbines don't take more energy to build than they will 
A 2010 analysis of fifty separate studies found that the average wind turbine, over the course of its operational life, generated 20 times more energy than it took to produce. This level was "favourable" in comparison to fossil fuels, nuclear and solar power. Many wind turbines have a designed service life of 20 years, although the actual
