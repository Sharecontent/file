## Aluminium production process
At an aluminium smelter, alumina is poured into special reduction cells with molten cryolite at 950℃. Electric currents are then induced in the mixture at 400 kA or above; this current breaks the bond between the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in liquid aluminium settling at the bottom of the reduction cell.

## What Aluminum Extraction Really Does to the Environment
Compared to producing virgin aluminum from raw bauxite, recycling old aluminum consumes just 5% of the energy and releases a mere 5% of the greenhouse gases . Infinitely recyclable, aluminum loses none of its integrity even when it is melted down repeatedly, plus, the whole recycling process can be achieved in less than 60 days flat.

## Aluminum extraction machinery manufacturer_Factory directly 
Recycling processing of Aluminum extraction machinery When the waste aluminum foil, waste aluminum foil plastic was sent into the plant, they will use the aluminum separator to directly produce, aluminum foil and plastic can be completely separated. The recovery aluminum can be used to smelting the aluminum ingots and also are the upper materials.

## The Aluminium Effect: Carbon Footprint of Recycled Aluminium - Cozero Blog
Jul 20, 2021On average, recycling aluminium emits 0.5 tCO2e/t of aluminium. The process requires less energy than primary aluminium production (only 5% of the energy used). According to ISO 14021, there are two types of materials in general: Pre-consumer material: Material diverted from the waste stream during a manufacturing process. Excluded is
