## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.

## Column Flotation for the Beneficiation of Iron Ore Fines - CORE
Indian iron ore industry is one of the world's largest and growing at a rapid pace. Optimum utilization of iron ore resources have become a national priority. As per the recent national steel policy, our country will be producing about 110 millions tons of steel per annum by 2020 requiring around 42 million tons of iron ore.

## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore  - SpringerLink
Characterization Studies. Particle size distribution of the iron ore fine sample is given in Table 1.It was observed from Table 1 that 50% sample is below 1800-μm size. Chemical analysis given in Table 1 indicated that, as particle size decreases, Fe content decreases up to 54.54%. Further, the size distribution of samples revealed that maximum quantity (66.60%) of Fe(T) was distributed in
