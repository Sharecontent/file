The material formed in the kiln is called 'clinker'. After cooling, the clinker may be stored temporarily in the clinker storage hall, or it may pass directly to the cement mill, which grinds the clinker to a fine powder. A small amount of gypsum is ground up with the clinker to control the setting properties of the cement when water is added.

The clinker is ground in a ball millâ€”a horizontal steel tube filled with steel balls. As the tube rotates, the steel balls tumble and crush the clinker into a super-fine powder. It can now be considered Portland cement. The cement is so fine it will easily pass through a sieve that is fine enough to hold water.
