## Folk limestone classification - Oxford Reference
A widely used classification of carbonates, based on the type of particles and the nature and proportion of the matrix and/or cement present. In his original classification Robert L. Folk defined three main components to limestones. These are allochems, comprising various grains and particles; micrite (microcrystalline calcite mud matrix); and sparite (sparry calcite cement).
