## Improving iron ore sintering process performance - CSIRO
Iron ore is one of Australia's largest export commodities worth around $50-60 billion annually. According to 2017 figures, Australia produces more than 800 million tonnes of iron ore a year, mostly for use in steel production. Research to improve iron ore sintering is helping to maintain one of Australia's major exports.
