The pattern of shot-holes drilled for solid blasting in coal in galleries of bord and pillar working is: 1. Wedge cut, or . 2. Fan cut . Drivage of a narrow gallery in coal without an undercut can be compared with drivage of a drift in stone. Blasting out coal in the centre of the face in the wedge cut pattern gives free face for the remaining

As underground coal mining has occurred in NSW for over 100 years, it is possible for the position of old mine workings to differ slightly from that shown on the Mine Survey Plans. To account for possible discrepancies in the position of old mine workings, the Underground Coal Mining Areas include a buffer zone around historical mine workings.

Andrew P. Schissler, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004 2.3 Strip Mining.Strip mining is employed in coal reserves where the overburden is removed in rectangular blocks in plan view called pits or strips. The pits are parallel and adjacent to each other. Strip mining is fundamentally different from contour or area mining on how the overburden is displaced, called spoil handling.
