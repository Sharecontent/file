## Are your Gears Grinding: Hip Flexor Pain or Hip Impingement?
As always, all of the above conditions are caused by overload, or too much water in the damaged tissue's bucket.

## Grinding Sand to Determine its Mineral Composition
Sand is a very common unconsolidated sedimentary rock, with its particle size varying between 0.063 and 2.0 mm. It also has an extremely variable mineral composition. Many types contain quartz or silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Sand is primarily used in the glass and construction industry because of its chemical and physical characteristics.
