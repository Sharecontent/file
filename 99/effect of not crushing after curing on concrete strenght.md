## Concrete additives for strength-point.shop
Addition of ETONIS® makes fresh concrete more pliable, which has a positive effect on its flow properties, pumpability and sedimentation stability. Higher Elasticity In hardened concrete, ETONIS® lowers the modulus of elasticity while keeping compressive strength high, making concrete ductile, even though it is concrete. In actual construction.

## Effects of cracks in concrete structuresdent.shop
When considering the effects of movement on a structure, there are two approaches that can be adopted. The first is to avoid cracking, by limiting the stresses induced in the concrete by restricting the amount of movement and/or the level of restraint. The second is to assume that cracking will occur and to control crack widths by providing.

Concrete needs the right amount of moisture in order to set at maximum strength. Too much water will see the concrete cure too fast, resulting in poor overall structural integrity and strength, too little and the concrete will be much harder to work into place.  The concrete needs time to cure and set before any third party forces are. Subscribe our Youtube Channel.
