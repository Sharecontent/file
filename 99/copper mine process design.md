## Cadia East Gold/Copper Mine Project, Australia - Fluor
The Cadia East orebody is one of the world's largest gold deposits, comprising a Mineral Resource of 2,347Mt containing 33.2Moz of gold and 6.59Mt of copper, along with a current Ore Reserve of 18.7Moz of gold and 3.16Mt of copper. It will underpin production from the Cadia Valley for at least the next 30 years.

## Make your copper mine more efficient and more sustainable - FLSmidth
This mechano-chemical process can leach 97-99% copper directly on site, from concentrates as low as 5% copper in less than six hours. This makes it feasible for you to produce cathode copper from concentrate directly at the site rather than to sell the concentrate to a smelter. The ROL process can even leach copper from arsenic-ladden concentrates.

However, by far the greatest extension in the use of copper resulted from Michael Faraday's discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 and the way that the effect could be used to generate electricity. The same principle was used to develop electric motors. The electric lamp was invented by Sir Joseph Swan in 1860 and brought to a commercial design by Thomas Edison in 1879.

Prospecting and exploration are precursors to mining and often occur simultaneously; together, they can take two to eight years to complete, and may cost from $500,000 to $15 million overall. Prospecting is the process of searching the region for mineral deposits. Historically, prospectors would explore a region on foot with a pick and shovel.

The long hole stopes are retreated from an extraction development drive with rib pillars left between stope lines for ground stability. Ore is extracted from the mine with 45-tonne haul trucks utilizing a 15% ramp to surface. The underground operations are currently producing

## Copper Flotation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Copper Flotation. Although basic porphyry copper flotation and metallurgy has remained virtually the same for many years, the processing equipment as well as design of the mills has continually been improved to increase production while reducing operating and maintenance costs. Also, considerable attention is paid to automatic sensing devices
