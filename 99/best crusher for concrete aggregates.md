## RECYCLED CONCRETE AGGREGATES - Fibo Intercon
Small pieces of scrap metal often go through the concrete crusher. After processing, it can be removed using an electromagnet. The concrete may go through a jawbreaker first, then an impactor and finally sorted using a screener. The screener will stockpile the crushed concrete into aggregate size, for example, 25mm 12mm 5mm to dust.

Impact Crushers are best used with softer rock, such as limestone and sandstone, and for recycling processed materials like concrete and asphalt. Impact crushers tend to produce more "fines" than Jaw crushers. Jaw Crushers have two opposing ribbed panels, or jaws, with one jaw moving forward and back to crush raw material against the fixed jaw.

Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

Cone crushers are compression machines that take in raw materials and reduce them in size by crushing them. A variety of industries rely on these tools, such as the concrete, aggregate, mining, coal, and natural gas industries. Inside the crusher, a piece of steel, known as the mantle, rotates eccentrically.
