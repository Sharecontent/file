## The processing of granite: Step by step - CKP
Granite quarrying. Granite is a type of rock formed deep below the earth´s surface from slowly cooling magma. Large machinery is brought in to extract (or quarry) the granite from open-pit mines using wire saws or diamond wire saws. Quality control already starts here. After quarrying, much of the stone is sold in blocks, and that which is cut

## Building Stone in Architecture | Bleck & Bleck Architects
November 12, 2013. For centuries, building stone has been used in architecture for its attractiveness, durability, and strength. Building stone has been admired by philosophers, writers and artists for centuries. "Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it." -Michelangelo.
