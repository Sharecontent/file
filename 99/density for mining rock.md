Sandstone. 2.2-2.8. Shale. 2.4-2.8. Slate. 2.7-2.8. As you can see, rocks of the same type can have a range of densities. This is partly due to different rocks of the same type containing different proportions of minerals. Granite, for example, can have a quartz content anywhere between 20% and 60%.

## Characteristics of explosives : Pit & Quarry
As mining engineering professor Richard Ash stated in 1963, an explosive is simply a tool for performing work.  Density. Ammonium nitrate has a base density of 1.73 g/cc, but commercial explosives never exhibit densities close to that. Typically, ANFO ranges from 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, with an average range of 0.84 to 0.86 g/cc due to the fact

## How can we measure the in situ density of rock mass in  - ResearchGate
Normally, one can take rock samples and take them to a Lab and measure the density. However, if you want to estimate the density of rocks in-situ, probably you have to carry our a detailed gravity
