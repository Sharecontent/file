## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate Quantity in Concrete 
Concrete Ingredients Calculation. For Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate. This is a Volumetric Calculation. Assuming we need 2 m 3 of concrete for M20 Concrete Mix, (Mix Ratio, M20 = 1 : 1.5 : 3) Total Part of the Concrete = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts. Therefore, Cement Quantity = (Cement Part / Concrete Parts )  Concrete Volume
