## How is fiber cement board manufacture
Fiber cement board manufacturing process also makes use of autoclave technology. In autoclave technology, polymer based composites are manufactured by applying intense heat and pressure to eliminate moisture from fibre cement materials. This leads to composite consolidation and the result is an extremely strong and robust fibre composite material.

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Cement manufacturing process involves various raw materials and processes. Cement is a greenish grey coloured powder, made of calcined mixtures of clay and limestone. When mixed with water becomes a hard and strong building material. It was first introduced by a British stone mason, Joseph Aspdin in 1824, who cooked cement in his kitchen.

## Cement Manufacture - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The dry process of cement manufacture is most often used, but some plants utilise the wet process, which avoids the necessity of drying the slag. In Germany the slag is used both in the manufacture of the Portland cement clinker by the dry process and for grinding subsequently with the clinker to form the Portland blastfurnace cement.

Cement manufacturing is a two-stage process. Materials such as limestone that contain calcium oxide are mixed with silica and alumina materials such as sand, shale or clay. The raw materials are usually dried and ground, and then the mixture is heated in a rotary kiln to form clinker. The clinker is then mixed with gypsum and other materials

The cement-making process can be divided into two basic steps: Clinker (the main constituent of cement) is first made in a kiln with gas up to 2000°C, which heats raw materials such as limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (e.g. clay) to 1,450°C. During this process, known as calcination
