##  Underground Coal Mining: Factors, Cost, and Time Considerations
Definition of Longwall Mining • A high extraction method of mining along the face of a predefined block of coal, referred to as a panel, while allowing the immediate roof to collapse upon advancement • Panel Configuration - Panels generally range in size from 500 to 1,000 feet in width and lengths exceeding two miles

## Underground mining - block caving, bore hole, drift fill, hard rock
Retreat mining is a process that recovers the supporting coal pillars, working from the back of the mine towards the entrance, hence the word retreat.Room and pillar mining advances inward, away from the entrance of the mine. Other underground mining methods include Hard rock mining, bore hole mining, drift and fill mining, long hole slope

## A Beginner's Guide to Underground Mining | An Underground Miner
Generally speaking, all underground mining can be placed into one of two categories. Those categories are hard-rock mining and soft rock mining. Different types of mining require different techniques and different tools. Some miners focus on both types of mining, while others decide to specialize in a single type. Now that you know the

## Underground mining of thick coal seams - ScienceDirect
Introduction. Thickness of a coal seam is an important geological parameter during selection of a suitable underground mining method for its efficient extraction. A coal seam of around 3-4 m thickness is, generally, observed to provide normal working height for efficient extraction and is suitable for most of the conventional mining methods.

Underground Mining Underground modes of access include drift, slope, and shaft mining, and actual mining methods include longwall and room and pillar mining. Drift mines enter horizontally into the side of a hill and mine the coal within the hill. Slope mines usually begin in a valley bottom, and a tunnel slopes down to the coal to be mined.

## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Underground Mining - Mining and Geomorphology
Longwall mining is a method of underground mining, usually used in coal mining. The method is fairly basic. A tunnel is created by basically cutting back the coal with a rotating drum and shearers. The coal fragments are then conveyed up to the surface. A series of hydraulic jacks (aka., chocks, are used to support the cavity wall, temporarily).

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) takes advantage of the same chemical reactions of coal to produce product gases, as those occurring in conventional gasifier reactors. The main difference is that in UCG the underground coal seam itself becomes the reactor, so that the gasification of the coal takes place underground instead of in a manufactured gasification vessel at the surface.1 Obviously

The techniques are the same, but each mining method uses specific equipment types to help with the mining process. Some years ago, miners used to use the old method known as "charge-and-blast" while clearing the rooms out. Nowadays, things are different, and miners depend on machines, which are used to drill a room until it is completely excavated.

Conventional mining is the oldest method. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining. In continuous mining, a machine known as a continuous miner cuts the coal from the mining face, obviating the need for drilling and blasting.

Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

##  Task 2.5 - Coaltech
The project is aimed at identifying and evaluating potential underground mining methods  Through the research it was established that approximately 1.1 billion tons of potentially mineable coal were left underground in the form of coal pillars during the period 1970 to 1997. This number is growing by approximately 110 million tons per annum
