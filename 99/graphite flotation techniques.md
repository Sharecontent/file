Sep 1, 2021In the graphite flotation process, 2% oil, cresol acid, and camphor oil are often used as frother. Among them, 2 # oil is the most commonly used frother in mineral processing plants, and its main component is terpineol (c9h17oh), with a general content of 40-60%.

Therefore, exploring emulsified kerosene as a collector for graphite flotation, especially for those reagent-costly fine graphite resources, is believed to provide valuable insights into the future development of high-efficient and economic flotation techniques. This work aims to prepare a stable HIP W/O kerosene emulsion for graphite flotation.

## Increasing the Fine Flaky Graphite Recovery in Flotation via a Combined 
In the study, the existence form of graphite and relationship of graphite with the associated gangue minerals were estimated by optical microscope analysis. The results indicated that the fine flaky graphite particles embedded with gangue minerals like a honeycomb, making it difficult to be beneficiated using the typical flotation technique.
