After nationalisation of the coal industry in India, India never witnessed demand-supply gap until 1991. After liberalisation reforms in 1993, to focus on the increasing energy demand, the government decided to allocate coal mines to various players for captive consumption (in captive mining coal is taken out by a company for its own use and it won't be able to sell it in the market).

## Coal Mines in India - Reserves, Largest Production & Types - IAS Babu Ji
Gondwana coal accounts for 98% of India's total coal reserves and 99% of the country's coal production. Gondwana coal is dry and high in phosphorus and sulfur. Because of its much younger age, Gondwana coal has a lower carbon concentration than Carboniferous coal, which is 350 million years old and nearly non-existent in India.
