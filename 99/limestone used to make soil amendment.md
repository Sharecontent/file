## Understanding Lime - Earth Science
Lime as a Soil Amendment. Lime has several benefits when used as a soil amendment. First, it can raise the pH of acidic soils. Although some plants (like azaleas and blueberries) require strongly acidic soil conditions, most plants prefer a pH that is closer to neutral (pH 7.0). Acidic soils can reduce nutrient availability to plants, including

## Using Powdered Lime (Calcium Carbonate) in the Garden
Effects of Garden Lime. Using garden lime in your soil does a few things for your garden. For starters, it puts calcium back into your soil, which is an essential nutrient for growing just about everything and prevents things like blossom-end rot from occurring. In addition, garden lime makes your soil less acidic in terms of pH.

Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

A: If you sell your compost in a state with a fertilizer or soil amendment law, and you make related claims, then the simple answer is YES! If you make soil amendment claims, you need to register as a soil amendment. If you make nutrient claims, then you register as a fertilizer. There are a few states that exempt compost from registration.
