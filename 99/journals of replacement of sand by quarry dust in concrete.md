river sand. Quarry dust and Marble powder contains similar properties as that of river sand and hence accepted as a building material. The present paper focuses on investigating maximum percentage replacement of river sand by Quarry dust and Marble powder in varying equal percentages 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% for M25 mix designations.

Yes, but it is a bad idea. First of all, you must compact the soil firmly before laying the paver . That means the soil must be perfectly flat, which is almost impossible to do. With sand, you can easily add more or take some out. Secondly, the sand allows water to drain out under the pavers .

## Review of Durability, Workability and Strength of Concrete by Replacing 
Because of increasing the use of natural sand as construction material, we need to focus on the use of alternate materials to protect the nature. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to emphasis the use of quarry dust and foundry sand in concrete as the placement of fine aggregate. Quarry dust and foundry sand are the waste by-products formed by stone crushing process and metal

## Replacement of cement by glass powder and sand quarry dust
5. • Test on Materials: 1. Compressive and flexural strength: Concrete prepared with different percentage replacement of cement by 5% to 40% at interval of 5% each and were tested at 28 days and 60 days. 2. Workability test: In this experimental work, the slump value of fresh concrete was in the range of 80mm to 100mm.
