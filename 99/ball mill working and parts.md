## Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses, Advantages and
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## Tumbling Mill Working Capacity Influencing Factors
Valid data shows that the suitable loading degree of the tumbling ball mill is 80%-90% of the total volume. Generally, the total load should not exceed five-quarters of the total capacity of the tumbling ball mill. Therefore, grinding steel balls generally account for 45%-55% of the total volume. In this range, the tumbling ball mill has the
