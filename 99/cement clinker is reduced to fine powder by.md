## How Cement Is Made
These ingredients, when heated at high temperatures form a rock-like substance that is ground into the fine powder that we commonly think of as cement.  After the clinker is cooled, cement plants grind it and mix it with small amounts of gypsum and limestone. Cement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.

## Cement hydration - Understanding Cement
Clinker is anhydrous (without water) having come from a hot kiln. Cement powder is also anhydrous if we ignore the small amount of water in any gypsum added at the clinker grinding stage. The reaction with water is termed "hydration". This involves many different reactions, often occurring at the same time.
