## Advantages & Disadvantages of Manufactured Sand (M Sand) in Constr 
The M-sand also provides strength to concrete during the construction phase hence the rise in the use of manufactured sand m-sand for concrete. Environment-friendly solution One cannot ignore M-sand's positive or should one say less harmful impact on the environment. M-sand is the only environmentally friendly solution in the market right now.

Lesser impurities and good working properties: Manufactured sand is free of silt and clay particles, and has denser particle packing than natural sand. It also offers higher flexural strength, better abrasion resistance, higher unit weight and lower permeability.
