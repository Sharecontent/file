## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher. The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended, as in the gyratory, but is supported in a curved, universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2). Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V-belt or direct drive.

## Jaw Crusher vs Cone Crusher: A Comparison - Sepro Aggregates
Cone crushers take care of secondary and tertiary crushing applications. Fine and medium-sized aggregates (used in asphalt and concrete, for example) are created by an eccentrically rotating shaft that grinds the rocks between a robust metal cone and a fixed wall. The Blackhawk 100 Cone Crusher is an example of a powerful cone crushing machine.

## Difference Between Standard and Short Head Cone Crusher
The maximum feed size is 300 mm, and the discharge size is about 20-40 mm. The short head cone crusher can be used for tertiary or quaternary crushing (fine crushing). The maximum feed size is 120 mm, and the output size is 5-20 mm. There are three designs for standard head and end cone crusher: "coarse", "medium" and "fine".

## Gyratory and Cone Crushers - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Gyratory crushers and cone crushers, while looking the same and performing similar duties, are two different machines.A quick look at a machine will allow you to determine if it is a gyratory or a cone In simple terms, if you look at the top of the crusher and it has supporting arms ("spider arms") going out to the centre of the machine (normally 2 or 3) it's a gyratory.
