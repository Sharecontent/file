Silver Ore is a naturally-occurring ore that, once harvested, can be refined into Silver Bars. When underground, the ore takes on a bright silver hue amongst the dirt and rock. It can be found farther underground in the early game, but later on becomes more common above ground as well. Silver Ore is primarily smelted at a Furnace to produce Silver Bars. Silver Ore may be refined for 15 Pixels

Silver Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers as well as on Floating Islands. Its primary use is to make Silver Bars, which can be used to make the Silver tier of equipment. The equivalent of Silver Ore is Tungsten Ore, which will sometimes replace Silver in a world.
