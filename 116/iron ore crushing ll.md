Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron. Ore greater than 60% iron is known as natural ore or direct shipping ore, meaning it can be fed directly into iron-making blast furnaces.

Crushing. As-mined iron ore contains lumps of varying size, the biggest being more than 1 metre (40 inches) across and the smallest about 1 millimetre (0.04 inch). The blast furnace, however, requires lumps between 7 and 25 millimetres, so the ore must be crushed to reduce the maximum particle size. Crushed ore is divided into various fractions

Most useful metal in the world, Iron, is extracted from iron ore. It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Iron ore is a mineral substance which, when heated in the presence of a reductant, will yield metallic iron (Fe). The iron ore, usually, very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3). Iron ores are mostly dark

Iron ore crushing. The extracted iron ore will be transported to the primary crusher. Over-sized and wet ore will be sent to the ROM stockpile for pre-treatment before it is sent to the primary crusher. Primary and secondary crushing followed by screening will result in lumps and fines sized between -32mm +8mm and -8mm respectively. The lump
