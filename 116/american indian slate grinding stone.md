The large stone metate had a bowl-like hollow that held food. The mano was held and used to grind the food against the hard surface of the metate. The resulting grounds had a mealy texture. Some Native American tribes would use a large, communal rock for grinding, and the women of the tribe would gather to socialize while working.
