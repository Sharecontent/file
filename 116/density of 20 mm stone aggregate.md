## Density of Construction Materials in kg/m3 and lb/ft3
It is represented by symbol called row ( p). Density represents the degree of compactness of material. If the material is of more density, it is more compacted material. Density is defined as the ratio of mass to volume. p = m/v Units = kg/m 3 or lb/ft 3 Conversion: 1 kg/m 3 = 0.624 lb/ft 3.

## Aggregate sand and gravelert-durch-elf
There is a 1:2:3 ratio of bags of cement and sand and gravel in 1 cubic meter. As a general rule of thumb, you can approximate this by percentage: If the total number of units of cement and aggregates in 4.5 cubic meters of concrete at a 1:2:3 ratio is 6. One-sixth of an inch equals 0.75 centimeters of cement.
