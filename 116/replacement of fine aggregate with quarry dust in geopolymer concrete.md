Plastic granules were used as the replacement for fine aggregates. The compressive strength and the tensile strength of different specimen were conducted to check the property of plastic granules and how effective is the specimen compared to normal concrete. Six mixes were made to compare with the increments of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%.

## Review of Durability, Workability and Strength of Concrete by Replacing 
Because of increasing the use of natural sand as construction material, we need to focus on the use of alternate materials to protect the nature. In this paper, a literature review is conducted to emphasis the use of quarry dust and foundry sand in concrete as the placement of fine aggregate. Quarry dust and foundry sand are the waste by-products formed by stone crushing process and metal

Abstract. The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem. The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason to search as a alternative material.
