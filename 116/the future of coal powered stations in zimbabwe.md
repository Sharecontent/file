## Hwange power station - Global Energy Monitor
Hwange power station. Hwange power station is a coal-fired power plant (and the biggest power plant in Zimbabwe) with an installed capacity of 920 megawatts (MW) in Matabeleland North Province, Zimbabwe. Due to deterioration, the plant is only capable of operating at partial capacity. A rehabilitation package has been funded.
