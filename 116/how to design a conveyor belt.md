## Materials conveyors: A guide for specifying belt conveyor systems
The first step in the design of a belt conveyor with a specified conveyor capacity is to determine the speed and width of the belt. The magnitude of the belt speed can be determined using: equation. Where: C = Conveyor capacity. r = Material density (kg/m3) V = Belt speed (m/s) A = Conveyor's belt cross-sectional area.

The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.

So, the capacity of the conveyor in 5 minute is ( (505)/25)  2. ie, 20 nos. So the capacity of this particular conveyor is 20 parts in 5 minutes or it will move 1 part in 15 Seconds. Hence the formula for the conveyor capacity is, ( (conveyor speed  time)/ (length of part))  no of parts along width of conveyor.

There's probably a way to have the center of force at the point where the collision occurs which would heighten the realism a bit (that way if the belt touches a corner of the box it rotates the box while propelling it). If you went this route you could then create a model that looks more like a conveyor belt (instead of rollers).

Every conveyor has a transition area at the head and tail end when the troughed belt transitions to a flat configuration before traveling around the pulley. As belt tensions are often highest at the head pulley, belt edged stresses in these areas are also the highest in the belt.However, many conveyor design calculation programs ignore these.
