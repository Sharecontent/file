3. Selective flocculation. In the selective flocculation process of kaolin, flocculants are added to make the kaolin particles flocculate and sink to the bottom. The iron-titanium impurities are reddish-brown in the upper suspension due to the fine particles, and most of the iron-titanium impurities can be removed by removing the upper suspension.

## flocculation to remove iron from kaolin
Reduction of Titanoferrous Impurities from Kaolin by  free iron from Kerala kaolin is removed by CDB treatment whereas in Gujarat kaolin both free and structural iron associated with titanoferrous impurity was difficult to remove. The crude kaolin contained 1.63 and 0.66 % TiO2 in Kerala and Gujarat kaolin respectively.
