Jaw Crushers are most often used as the first stage in the size reduction of many different types of materials in a wide range of applications. They use compressive force to break material between a stationary piece of steel (called a jaw die) and a moving piece of steel that together create a V-shaped cavity called the crushing chamber. Watch the video below to see how a Jaw Crusher works.
