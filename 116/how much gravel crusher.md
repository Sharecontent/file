A 250 foot driveway would need approximately 38.58 tons gravel. Driveway gravel prices: how much does a ton of gravel cost. Gravel costs by the ton vary by the size of the gravel, region and by supplier. Lighter, more natural looking tan crushed stone colors can be as much as double the cost of crushed gravel.

Jan 20, 2021As an example, a 10-foot wide, 20-foot long driveway is a 200-square foot area. Then, multiply the area by the depth. For instance, if you are using four inches of crushed stone under a patio area or for a driveway, four inches converted to feet is .33. So, our calculation is .33 x 200 ÷ 27, or 2.46 cubic yards.

How many yards is a ton of gravel? Measuring the Driveway To measure the driveway in cubic feet, multiply the length by width by depth. For cubic yards, divide the total cubic feet by 27. Because one cubic yard of gravel is equal to 1.13 tons, you can multiply your total cubic yards by 1.13 to convert this measurement to tons.

In this article, when I reference gravel, I'm referring to crushed rock between ¾" and 1" in diameter - roughly. Gravel can be compacted. This is beneficial because it allows you to create a level surface. A level surface allows you to determine exactly how much concrete you'll need. The most major benefit, though, is drainage.

## Gravel Calculator
Crushed stone. Crushed stone is a type of medium-sized gravel that is formed by mechanically crushing stone. Most commonly, limestone, dolomite, or granite is crushed to form the crushed stone. In certain definitions of the term, crushed stone is not considered gravel since it is a processed rather than naturally-occurring rock fragment.
