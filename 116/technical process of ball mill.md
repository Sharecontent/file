The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill grinding load. Rods in place weigh approximately 400 pounds per cu. ft. and balls in place approximately 300 pounds per cu. ft.. Thus, quantitatively, less material can progress through the voids in the rod mill grinding media than in the ball mill

## Ball Mills - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
In all ore dressing and milling Operations, including flotation, cyanidation, gravity concentration, and amalgamation, the Working Principle is to crush and grind, often with rod mill or ball mill, the ore in order to liberate the minerals. In the chemical and process industries, grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.

## The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide
The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically fall and impact

## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.
