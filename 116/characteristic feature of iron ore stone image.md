However, RM is widely considered to be a potential resource due to its high content of valuable metal components such as iron. High-iron RM is rich in iron and can potentially become a valuable resource if the iron can be extracted effectively. It is of great research value and profound significance to recover iron from high-iron RM.

Density. Unusual density is one of meteorites' more characteristic features. It's not enough to say your rock is heavy. Density is how heavy a rock is for its size or compared with other rocks.Iron meteorites are 3.5 times as heavy as ordinary Earth rocks of the same size, while stony meteorites are about 1.5 times as heavy.

The major difference between iron produced by human activity and meteoritic iron is the presence of the element nickel. Iron metal in all meteorites contains at least some nickel whereas man-made metal objects generally do not. In addition, the interior structure of iron meteorites is unique and unlike any man-made metal alloys.
