The crusher can be divided into three types according to the particle size of the feed and the final product. Primary crusher ( from mm to mm); secondary crusher ( from mm to 100-40mm); tertiary crusher ( from 100-40mm to 30-10mm). Crusher also can be classified according to the working principle and mechanical structure.

Types of crusher depend on the feeding method. These are- Primary crusher, Secondary crusher and Tertiary crusher. The primary crusher is only for the breaking of large stones into pieces (this means primary crusher is not for the aggregate size material.). Examples of primary crushers are jaw crusher; hammer mill crusher and gyratory crusher.

## Different Types of Aggregate Crushers
Aggregate crusher is a machine designed to grind or crush various types of rocks into relatively uniform pieces. Aggregate crushers are used in mining, quarrying and recycling operations. There are several types of crushers that can accomplish this task, including hammer crushers, drum crushers, jaw crushers and rotary crushers.

Sean Donaghy, national sales manager of IROCK Crushers discusses what needs to be considered when choosing a crusher. Crushing rock is an age-old idea, but the reality of the task is a far cry from that of Fred Flintstone and his good buddy Barney Rubble. Although crushing rock and other materials may seem simple, it is really a science.
