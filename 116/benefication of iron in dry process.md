## What is the Beneficiation Process?
The beneficiation process can be defined as a treatment process of ore which results in a more concentrated form of the product. It is often used in the preparation of iron ore for smelting. This is an essential process as it helps improve the yield from a deposit of ore, thereby increasing the potential profits that can be obtained from the

## dry process beneficiation plant for iron ore
2014/04/03· The process adopted to upgrade the Fe content of iron ore is known as iron ore beneficiation (IOB). However, Iron ores from different sources have their own peculiar mineralogical characteristics and require the specific beneficiation and metallurgical treatment to get the best product out of it.

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.
