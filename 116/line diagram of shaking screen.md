Normally, the setting is used to automatically alter the screen's brightness based on data from the screen's light sensors. But sometimes, there might be a hardware issue or a software glitch resulting from either a recent update or the software being out of date. Either of this will cause flickering and shaking for your screen.

Lets go through a industrial single line diagram. When interpreting a single line diagram, you should always start at the top where the highest voltage is and work your way down to the lowest voltage. This helps to keep the voltages and their paths straight. To explain this easier, we have divided the single line into three sections.
