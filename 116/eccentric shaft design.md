## Design of an eccentric lobe | Physics Forums
Guys does anyone know the design procedure for an eccentric lobe and a crankshaft. Crank is subjected to maximum load 350 kg periodically. As load is applied the crank rotates the eccentric for about 50 degrees and runs the shaft connected to the eccentric runner. Its urgent. Can anyone help out.

## Eccentric (mechanism)
In mechanical engineering, an eccentric is a circular disk (eccentric sheave) solidly fixed to a rotating axle with its centre offset from that of the axle (hence the word "eccentric", out of the center).. It is used most often in steam engines, and used to convert rotary motion into linear reciprocating motion to drive a sliding valve or pump ram. To do so, an eccentric usually has a groove

## Design of eccentric displacement gear - ZHY Gear
Design of eccentric displacement gear The machining method of the eccentric modification gear generated by the modification method is the same as that of the elliptical and non-circular gears. The essence of the machining is that the straight line of the rack cutter pitch is tangent to the curve of the eccentric gear pitch and it is pure rolling.

The eccentric shaft is an essential part of the fully variable valve lift control. The valve lift changes continuously from maximum to almost zero by rotating / pivoting the eccentric (shaft) by means of an electric motor. This is a SELZER product, as a one-piece forged blank was replaced by individual parts (shaft, eccentric, control-sleeve gear).

The shafts, compared to those in a reciprocating engine, use much lower throws; in our usual parlance we might say they have a high degree of overlap. There is no requirement to provide thrust surfaces on the eccentrics (the equivalent of crankpins) as the thrust of the rotors is taken by the housings.

Eccentric shaft rotation is controlled by Valvetronic motor (VVT Motor) to when and how much lift the valves. Eccentric Shaft Sensor (ESS) reads the rotation degree of this shaft. Now, if the VVT motor or ESS fails, engine starts running rough. Idle's RPM fluctuates. Engine vibrates and DME throws a CEL. That is the case when there is a hard fail.

The animation below shows the structure and operating principle of a cycloidal drive. An eccentric shaft (drive shaft) first drives a cycloidal disk. Fixed ring pins are arranged in a circle around the eccentric shaft, in which the cycloidal disc engages. Due to the eccentric motion, the cycloidal disc is driven around these pins so that the

The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on the concave, material is
