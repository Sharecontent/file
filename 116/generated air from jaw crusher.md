## What Are Jaw Crushers and How Do They Work? | Oreflow
March 28, 2019 / in News. A jaw crusher is a large piece of equipment that's used in mine and ore processing plants to crush rocks. The equipment was first introduced back in 1858 by inventor Eli Whitey Black who primarily developed machinery used for crushing stone. From there, jaw crushers have seen plenty of action in the pit and quarry

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

Find the gape size when the capacity of jaw crushers is 5, the width of crusher is 3 and the closed single setting of jaw crusher is 6. This implies that; C JC = Capacity of Jaw Crushers = 5. W = Width of Crusher = 3. CSS = Closed Single Setting of Jaw Crushers = 6. G = CJC x CSS / W. G = 5 x 6 / 3. G = 30 / 3.

High manganese steel. High manganese steel is the traditional material of the jaw plate of jaw crusher, which has good impact load resistance. However, due to the structure of the crusher, the opening angle between the movable and fixed jaws is too large, which is easy to cause abrasive sliding and deformation due to deformation.

Introduction. 1. The distinctive feature of jaw crusher is the two plates which open and shut like animal jaws. The jaws are set at an acute angle to each other, and one jaw is pivoted so that it swings relative to the other fixed jaw. Material fed into the jaws is alternately nipped and released to fall further into the crushing chamber.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.
