Due to the influence from the admixture and sand coarse aggregate, Water-reducing rate in concrete is different from that of motar. A. PCE water-reducing admixture has the characteristics of low dosing and high water reduction. The water-saving rate is 25% to 40%, which is suitable for the preparation of high-strength and high-performance concrete.

In the mixtures, basaltic-pumice (scoria) was used as lightweight aggregate. A control lightweight concrete mixture made with lightweight basaltic-pumice (scoria) containing normal Portland cement as the binder was prepared. The control lightweight concrete mixture was modified by replacing 20% of the cement with fly ash.

## Heavyweight and Lightweight Aggregates | Civil Engineering X
The structural lightweight aggregates are defined by ASTM C330 and C331. They are either manufactured (expanded clay, shale, or slate, or blastfurnace slag) or natural (scoria and pumice). These aggregates produce concretes generally in the strength range of 3000 to 4000 psi; higher strengths are attainable and are discussed in Art. 4.17.
