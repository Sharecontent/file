## What Kind of Sand Making Process does the Sand Production Line Have 
Nov 1, 2021It can be seen that dry sand making can make full use of the finished products. The general process of wet sand making and dry sand making is the same, except that a lot of water resources are needed in the sand making process. Therefore, wet sand making is more suitable for rainy and water-rich areas.

The manufactured sand has good gradation continuity. Disadvantage. During the production process, the dust is relatively large, and measures such as centralized dust removal and spray dust reduction are required. Higher requirements for masterbatch control (mud content, water content, weak mountain leather, etc.) Disposal of recycled stone powder.
