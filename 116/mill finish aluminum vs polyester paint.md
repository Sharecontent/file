## Aluminum 5052 Supplier | Metalwest | Flat Rolled Metals
ASTM B209. Mill finish aluminum 5052 is a higher strength alloy than the 1100 or 3003 series. It offers excellent corrosion resistance and its major alloying element is magnesium. Magnesium allows for a much lower melting point without the brittleness. Aluminum 5052 is a non-heat treatable aluminum alloy. Aluminum is created by mining bauxite ore.

## How Does Anodized Aluminum Compare To Painted Aluminum?
First and foremost - an anodized layer doesn't chalk, flake, chip, or peel. Once painted metal begins to flake or peel it tends to spread until more and more of the paint comes off. So anodized aluminum from Lorin will stay looking good longer with no costly repairs. The anodized layer is also much easier to clean, and needs to be cleaned

I think there's an oxymoron in there, Josh. Mill finish aluminum is not anodized because anodizing is an electrolytic secondary finish. But all metal must be pretreated if it is to be painted, and a chromate conversion coat (Mil C-5541, Alodine, Iridite) is probably the most appropriate pretreatment. Ted Mooney, P.E.
