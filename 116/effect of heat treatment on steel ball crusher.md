Depending on the project, hot and malleable steel will be dipped in either water or oil to cool. This brings the steel back to a solid state and often leaves it brittle. Heat treated steel can also be left to air cool. But as mentioned in the different steps of heat treatment above, the way steel is cooled will greatly affect its finished quality.

Increasing the cooling rate of pearlitic steel (0.77 percent carbon) to about 200° C per minute generates a DPH of about 300, and cooling at 400° C per minute raises the DPH to about 400. The reason for this increasing hardness is the formation of a finer pearlite and ferrite microstructure than can be obtained during slow cooling in ambient air.
