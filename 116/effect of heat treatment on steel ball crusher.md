## Heat Treatment of Steel: An Overview of the Process - Miheu
Depending on the project, hot and malleable steel will be dipped in either water or oil to cool. This brings the steel back to a solid state and often leaves it brittle. Heat treated steel can also be left to air cool. But as mentioned in the different steps of heat treatment above, the way steel is cooled will greatly affect its finished quality.

Increasing the cooling rate of pearlitic steel (0.77 percent carbon) to about 200Â° C per minute generates a DPH of about 300, and cooling at 400Â° C per minute raises the DPH to about 400. The reason for this increasing hardness is the formation of a finer pearlite and ferrite microstructure than can be obtained during slow cooling in ambient air.

The atmosphere of the heating furnace also affects the condition of the steel being heat-treated. All the heat-treating processes consist of subjecting the steel to a definite time-temperature cycle. This time-temperature cycle has three components namely (i) heating, (ii) holding at particular temperature range (soaking), and (iii) cooling.

Stress Relieving:- Stress relieving is a heat treatment process that decreases stress in metals after they have been quenched, cast, normalized, and so on. Stress is relieved by heating metal to a temperature lower than that required for transformation. After this process, the metal is then slowly cooled.
