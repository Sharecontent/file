## Crushing Mineral Processing
In mineral processing, the reduction of minerals by crushing and grinding may be regarded as having one or other of two main objectives: the attainment of a size appropriate for the direct industrial application of the mineral, e.g. barytes, sand, aggregate; or the release of metallic or ore inclusions from an unwanted matrix with a view to maximum separation. In both cases, quarrying, as a rule by explosives, followed by coarse crushing of the quarried lumps and then by intermediate or
