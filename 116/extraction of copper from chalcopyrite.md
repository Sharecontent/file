## During the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite iron is removed as?
The copper(II) ions in the chalcopyrite are reduced to copper(I) sulfide (which is reduced further to copper metal in the final stage). How is copper extracted from copper ore? Copper mining is usually performed using open-pit mining, in which a series of stepped benches are dug deeper and deeper into the earth over time.

Copper, Copper occurs in various forms. It can occur naturally in its pure state (native copper) but is principally mined as chalcopyrite. Copper is one of the most important and widely used metals of modern society due to its properties of: high electrical and heat conductivity, ductile and malleable, resistant to corrosion,

Organic Chemistry. About 3/4 th of Copper (Cu) produced in the world has come from Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2 ), but it is the lowest standard ore of Copper. The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulphide ores such as chalcopyrite are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores.

## Bioleaching of copper from chalcopyrite ore by fungi - PubMed
This property of microorganisms is being harnessed during the recent years for extraction of metals from their ores, especially from low-grade ores. In the present study bioleaching of copper from its low-grade chalcopyrite ore using 26 isolates of acidophilic fungi is reported.

Siddhartha Mondal Asks: Extraction of copper from chalcopyrite During the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite ore, the ore ($ce{Cu2S.Fe2S3}$) is heated to form $ce{Cu2S}$ and $ce{Fe2S}$. Then during smelting it reacts with $ce{O2}$ to form $ce{Cu2O}$. Then it is written that

## copper extraction and purification - A-Level Chemistry Revision 
The method used to extract copper from its ores depends on the nature of the ore. Sulphide ores such as chalcopyrite are converted to copper by a different method from silicate, carbonate or sulphate ores. Getting copper from chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2. Chalcopyrite (also known as copper pyrites) and similar sulphide ores are the commonest ores of
