## Soil Types in Kenya
There are five main types of soil in Kenya: 1. Loamy Soils Loam soil is primarily a mixture of clay and sand soil. In Kenya, loamy soil is majorly found in Western Kenya and parts of the Rift Valley. Characteristics of loam soils: i) Usually very fertile. ii) Well drained. iii) Moderate moisture retention capabilities. iv) High level of nutrients.

Location. 1st Floor. There are three kinds of rock: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks form when molten rock (magma or lava) cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks originate when particles settle out of water or air, or by precipitation of minerals from water. They accumulate in layers.

There are two basic types: Intrusive igneous rocks crystallize below Earth's surface, and the slow cooling that occurs there allows large crystals to form. Examples of intrusive igneous rocks are diorite, gabbro, granite, pegmatite, and peridotite. Extrusive igneous rocks erupt onto the surface, where they cool quickly to form small crystals.
