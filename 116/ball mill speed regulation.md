## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
Most ball mills operate at approximately 75% critical speed, as this is determined to be the optimum speed. The true optimum speed depends upon the drum diameter. Larger drum diameters operate at lower than 75% critical speed whilst smaller drum diameters operate at higher than 75% critical speed. General Notes,

5. DEFINITON: • A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes, paints, pyrotechnics, ceramics and selective laser sintering etc. 6. PRINCIPLE: A ball mill works on the principle of impact and attrition. size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.

I aim for 65% of the critical speed. Critical speed = 265.45 / SQRT (jar ID in inches - media diameter in inches). For an 8.5" ID jar with 1/2" lead media, the critical speed is 93.82rpm, 65% of that is 60.98 rpm. For a 6" ID jar, the critical speed is 113rpm, 65% of that is 73.5rpm.

## ball mill speed regulation
Mar 10, 2020· For a ball mill to work, critical speed must be achieved. Critical speed refers to the speed at which the enclosed balls begin to rotate along the inner walls of the ball mill. If a ball mill fails to reach critical speed, the balls will remain stationary at the bottom where they have little or no impact on the material.

22 May, 2019. The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force. At a certain height, it will automatically

## Process Control of Ball Mill Based on MPC-DO - Hindawi
Process Control of Ball Mill Based on MPC-DO: The grinding process of the ball mill is an essential operation in metallurgical concentration plants. Generally, the model of the process is established as a multivariable system characterized with strong coupling and time delay. In previous research, a two-input-two-output model was applied to describe the system, in which some key indicators of
