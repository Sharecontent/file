## Coal | National Geographic Society
Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that can be burned for fuel and used to generate electricity.It is composed mostly of carbon and hydrocarbons, which contain energy that can be released through combustion (burning). Coal is the largest source of energy for generating electricity in the world, and the most abundant fossil fuel in the United States.

## Coal extraction - Eniscuola
The first method consists in extracting coal while leaving "pillars" to support the roof of the mine. The second method envisages the use of a series of supporting structures called "scaffoldings" which can be easily removed and support the roof in the mining area. While the extraction goes on, the scaffoldings are removed and the roof
