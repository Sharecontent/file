## Minerals and Mining in South Africa | SpringerLink
Abstract. Mining in southern Africa has a long pre-colonial history. Haematite mining in Swaziland can be traced back more than 40,000 years, iron smelting dates from 400 AD or earlier, and copper from 900 AD. The most iconic evidence for pre-colonial mining are the gold artefacts from Mapungubwe dated between 1220 and 1300 AD.

Ancient Mining In South Africa: Specularite Of Enoch's Shining Gods. Bronze was a prized metal in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. It is an alloy of copper and tin and its production requires smelters at temperatures above 1 500 degrees Celsius. It is unlikely to have been produced accidentally by mixing copper and tin rock around campfires.
