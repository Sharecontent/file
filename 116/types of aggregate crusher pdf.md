At this point, the material receives its first reduction in size from its raw state. Primary crushing produces materials ranging from 1500mm to 350mm, on average. The two main types of primary crushers are: Jaw Crushers: large amounts of material are fed into the "V-shaped" jaw of this crusher and are reduced using compressive force. One side of the V remains stationary while the other side of the V swings against it.
