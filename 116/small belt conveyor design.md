## 12 Key Considerations for Pneumatic Conveying Systems Design
Mar 22, 2022A general guideline is that pressure conveying is recommended if the total conveying distance exceeds 300FT. Mainly because we can only generate a vacuum of less than 28.9 Inch HG (or 14.5 PSIG), whereas in pressure conveying, the air can deliver pressures exceeding 14.5 PSIG. 3.

The successful design of a belt conveyor must begin with an accurate appraisal of the characteristics of the material to be transported. The angle of repose of a material is the acute angle which the surface of a normal, freely formed pile makes to the horizontal.
