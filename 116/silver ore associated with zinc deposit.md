## 9 Ore Deposits and Economic Minerals - Mineralogy - OpenGeology
Most South African ore deposits are associated with regions called Precambrian greenstone belts, ancient volcanic terranes. Similar greenstone belts in Canada account for many of North America's metallic ore deposits.  The moneymaking metals are mostly copper and zinc, but silver, gold, lead, and other metals are important too. Ore

Silver and gold are recovered by Parkes process, whereby a small amount of zinc stirred into molten lead dissolves the precious metals. This molten alloy then rises to the surface of the lead as an easily removed scum, and the zinc is removed from the silver or gold by distillation.

Copper is found alongside many other types of ore. It can be found near gold, silver, zinc, lead, and other types of metal deposits. When mixed in with other ores, copper is not usually found in great abundance. Until the development of the modern copper mining process, it was typically a byproduct of mining for other metals.
