## Copper Production And Beneficiation
Copper production About 80 % of primary copper production comes from low-grade or poor sulfide ores. After enrichment steps, the copper concentrates are usually treated by pyrometallurgical methods. Generally, copper extraction follows the sequence (see Figure below): 1. Beneficiation by froth flotation of ore to give copper concentrate. READ MORE
