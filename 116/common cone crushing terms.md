## Cone Crusher Explained - saVRee
The spring cone crusher design is able to pass uncrushable materials e.g. tramp metal, through the crushing cavity by using springs. The first hydraulic cone crusher was developed in 1948 and this allowed for the opening of the crushing cavity hydraulically, instead of using springs (mechanical actuation). Both the spring and hydraulic cone

Choking means a complete, or practically complete, stoppage of the downward flow of material in the crushing chamber. It may be the result of an external condition, such as a "backup" of material occasioned by an obstruction in the discharge chute, in which case choking is followed by packing in the crushing chamber. Or choking may be the result of a condition existing within the crushing chamber, such as too close a discharge setting, too many fines in the feed, or sticky material.
