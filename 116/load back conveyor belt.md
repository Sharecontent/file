## Conveyor Belt Calculations • Con Belt
Belt tension: The belt of the conveyor always experience a tensile load due to the rotation of the electric drive, weight of the conveyed materials, and due to the idlers. The belt tension at steady state can be calculated as: Tb = 1.37fLg[2mi+ (2mb + mm)cos (δ)] + (Hgmm)eqn.1.1. Where, Tb is in Newton. f = Coefficient of friction. L = Conveyor length in meters. Conveyor length is approximately half of the total belt length.
