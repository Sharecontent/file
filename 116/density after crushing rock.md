## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate

## Rock density and porosity - PetroWiki
For rocks without sensitive minerals such as smectites, the porosity and dry, grain, and saturated densities can be derived from the saturated mass, dry mass, and volume (or buoyant weight). These measurements allow calculation of saturated, dry, and grain density as well as porosity and mineral and pore volume by employing Eqs. 3 through 5 .

For a max size of 300 mm, you need a 2 m diameter hole; 450 mm requires 3 m diameter. Basically the diameter of the ring is 6 to 7 times the maximum stone diameter. There are depth requirements too. So, a lot depends on the maximum size of the stone. Bigger stone requires as larger diameter ring which means if you are doing this at a depth of 2
