## Coal Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

## Room and Pillar Mining Method - SlideShare
7. Practical importance of the Room and pillars method: Method widely used in coal mines and non- carbon worldwide. In the 70s in the USA, over 50% of production (underground) coal came from this method. Currently, most of the production is still done by R & P. It is the mining method used in underground coal mining in southern Brazil.

## Commonly used mining techniques to extract coal - ICSC
As mining of coal depends on the depth and quality of the coal seams, different techniques are used to dig the deposits. Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two main methods of mining coal. Depth, density, and thickness of the coal seam are the factors that are taken into account while selecting the mining method for coal extraction.

## A fuzzy method for selecting underground coal mining method  - DeepDyve
One of the crucial decisions affecting productivity of the mine is the mining method selection. Longwall mining is quite common in underground coal mining, and it allows the use of mechanization. As application of mechanization increases, production also increases and the number of workers decreases. Thus, the organization of work is easier, and the number of accidents decreases in the mine

There are six principal methods of underground mining: Longwall mining accounts for about 50 percent of underground production. The longwall shearer has a face of 1,000 feet (300 m) or more. It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal seam. The loosened coal falls on to a pan line

Auger mining is usually associated with contour strip mining. With this method, the coal is removed by drilling auger holes from the last contour cut and extracting it in the same manner that shavings are produced by a carpenter's bit. Coal recovery rates approach 60 percent with this method. The cutting heads of some augers are as high as 2.
