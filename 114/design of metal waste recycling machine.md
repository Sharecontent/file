Design for recycling is an eco-design strategy. Eco-design is a systematic approach allowing the design of more environmentally friendly products. For a company with a strategy to reduce its environmental impacts, the first stage is to review all the processes intervening in the design of a product and to find solutions to reduce the impacts on the product's life cycle.
