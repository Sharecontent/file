## Cement Manufacturing Process: 6 StepsTo Make Cement | Cement Equipment
6 steps of the cement manufacturing process. When we talked about the manufacturing of cement, anyone who knows the cement manufacturing process slightly will mention "two grinding and one calcination", they are namely: cement raw material preparation, clinker production, and cement grinding. In the real cement production line, we detail the cement manufacturing process in six steps

Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## How is fiber cement board manufacture
Fiber cement board manufacturing process also makes use of autoclave technology. In autoclave technology, polymer based composites are manufactured by applying intense heat and pressure to eliminate moisture from fibre cement materials. This leads to composite consolidation and the result is an extremely strong and robust fibre composite material.

The cement manufacturing process starts from the mining of raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, mainly limestone and clays. A limestone quarry is inside the plant area and a clays quarry is as far from the plant area as 25 km. The limestone is excavated from open cast mines after drilling and blasting and loaded onto dumpers

There are three steps of the high-temperature system: Drying or preheating, calcining, and sintering. The calcining is the core part of the clinker production; the raw meal is weighed and sent into preheater and cement kiln to process clinker. Grate cooler helps to cooler clinker, the cooled clinker is sent to the cement silo for storage.
