There have been several methods developed by miners to extract gold particles from ore over the last hundred or so years. Of those methods, the 'Cyanide Leaching Process' (Cyanidation), is the method that is commonly used the most often to do this. As the name implies, the main component in the process is a sodium cyanide solution.

The classic method of extracting gold is to first dissolve it with a cyanide solution, then replace the gold with the metal from the gold-containing solution, or adsorb it by the carbon slurry method, and then recover the gold from the carbon. The residual cyanide should be removed before returning or discharging the lean liquid to the environment.

Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining. Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes,  Cyanide extraction of gold is the dominant method for obtaining gold. Finely ground rock is treated with a solution of sodium cyanide. The extract is absorbed onto carbon.
