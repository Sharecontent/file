## Extraction and separation of manganese and iron from ferruginous 
During the mining, crushing, beneficiation and transportation of rich Mn ores, about 30% of the mined ores are converted into manganese ore fines with low Mn grade (Singh et al., 2011). In India, almost half of manganese ore resources are ferruginous in nature (Singh et al., 2011, Singh and Biswas, 2017).

## flotation gold manganese ores
The manganese oxide ore process concludes ore washing-jigging-strong magnetic separation process. After crushing to less than 70 mm, the ore need to be washed, sieved and classified, firstly got material with + 30 mm needs manual beneficiation, then -30 mm ore is dressed by jig, and last ore with mm should be processed by roller-type strong
