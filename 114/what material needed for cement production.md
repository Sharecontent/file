## what material needed for cement production
Aug 30, 2012Â· Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

A further 40% of cement emissions come from burning fossil fuels to heat kilns to the high temperatures needed for this calcination process. The last 10% of emissions come from fuels needed to mine and transport the raw materials. Therefore, cement emissions depend largely on the proportion of clinker used in each tonne of cement.

## Everything about Cement Production
Clinker is ground to a fine powder in a cement mill and mixed with gypsum to create cement. The powdered cement is then mixed with water and aggregates to form concrete that is used in construction. The composition of clinker, such as free lime, has to be closely monitored to ensure the quality of the cement.

Cement Production. Cement is the binding agent in concrete. It's a mixture of different elements, which include calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. When water is added to it, a chemical reaction is activated. This causes the cement to harden, holding any aggregates in the mixture in place.
