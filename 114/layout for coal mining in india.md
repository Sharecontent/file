## Coal Industry in India - Economics Discussion
In 1884, only 68.9% of the coal consumed on Indian railways was of domestic origin. This proportion gradually rose till, in 1903, 99.2% was obtained from Indian collieries. Imports of coal declined from 8.4 lakh tons in 1894 to 1.9 lakh tons in 1903; exports, first begun in 1886, increased to 4.4 lakh tons in 1903.
