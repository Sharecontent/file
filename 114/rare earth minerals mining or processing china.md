## China Wrestles with the Toxic Aftermath of Rare Earth Mining
Beginning in the 1990s, rare earth mining took off in this region, located in Southeast China about 300 miles north of Hong Kong. As China began to produce more smartphones, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and other high-tech products requiring rare earth elements, the mining intensified. But the removal of these elements from the earth's

Credit: The Red Line, YouTube With the possibility of China weaponizing the rare earth supply chain becoming a widely recognized concern, countries are pouring resources into expanding rare earth extraction operations elsewhere, such as in North America and Australia.. However, mining rare earth ores is only the first step in securing the rare earths supply chain.

## Does China pose a threat to global rare earth supply chains?
China's share of global mining production has slipped as a result, from a high of 97.7 percent in 2010 to 62.9 percent in 2019 - the lowest point since 1995. China's share of global rare earth reserves has likewise fallen from 50 percent to 36.7 percent over the same period. 3.

## Rare-earth element
The rare earth mining and smelting process can release airborne fluoride which will associate with total suspended particles (TSP) to form aerosols that can enter human respiratory systems and cause damage and respiratory diseases.  In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons
