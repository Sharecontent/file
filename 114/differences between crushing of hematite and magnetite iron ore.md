## What is the difference between magnetite and hematite iron ore?
The main difference between magnetite and hematite is that magnetite is ferromagnetic whereas hematite is paramagnetic. Why is magnetite magnetic but not hematite? "Magnetizing" Hematite True hematite, though iron-containing, actually has a weak magnetic field because of the way its iron atoms are aligned.

The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.
