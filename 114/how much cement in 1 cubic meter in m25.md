## M25 Concrete Ratio Calculation
M25 Concrete Cement Required. Volume of cement = (Cement Proportion / Sum of Ratio) x Dry Volume of Concrete. Cement = (1/4) x 1.54 = 0.385 cubic meter. As we know that density of Cement is 1.44 gm/cm 3 or 1440 kg/m3. Therefore, multiply volume of cement with its specific gravity to get weight of cement.
