Miners use heavy mining machinery to drill wide steps known as benches, which separate the rock containing gold (ore) from the rock with no economic quantities of gold (waste). Next, blasting occurs to break down the rock making it easier to move. A fleet of excavators mine designated ore areas and move the gold containing ore to stockpiles.

2 days agoUS Geological Survey scientists believe that there are still 52,000 tons of gold in the ground, and this estimate is on the conservative side. Their in-depth surveys pinpoint select gold regions where a prospector's chances of finding gold are most likely. The American Mining Rights Association (AMRA) also keeps tabs on gold hot spots.

## Gold Ore Kinetics | MACH Reactor | Metallurgical Industry
Gold Ore (Pty) Ltd. has found a way to harness this powerful energy and use it for something good. Chemical reactions are governed by the interaction of energy and matter. Imploding cavitating bubbles generate temperatures of up to 5,500°C and pressures of around 1,000 atmospheres, creating a highly reactive environment for mass transfer and

## Gold extraction
A "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra-fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals. These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes. These refractory ores require pre-treatment in order for cyanidation to be effective in recovery of the gold. A
