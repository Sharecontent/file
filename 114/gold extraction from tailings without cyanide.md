## From Tailings to Treasure? A New Mother Lode - Advancing Mining
DRD Gold extracted 33,600 ounces of gold, worth nearly US$40 million, in the last quarter of 2013. Mintails, a mine tailings processor, has developed new technology to process 350,000 tons of slimes from its extensive tailings resources. It expects to recover 58 kg of gold per month, and has enough slimes to last until 2025.

Jan 2, 2021Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold. Partially due to cyanide, modern mines are. much larger than before cyanide was used; create vast open pits; and; produce huge quantities of waste. More than 20 tons of mine waste are generated to produce enough gold for a typical ring.

## How gold is extracted by Cyanidation Process - Refresh Science
Cyanidation is a method used in the extraction of gold from its ore. This extraction is done by converting the gold to a water-soluble form. The cyanidation process of gold extraction or the use of cyanide is the most common leaching process, used in the extraction of gold from its ores. Some countries do not approve of this method of gold

## Hydrometallurgical Recovery of Gold from Mining Wastes
Cyanide is a cheap but highly toxic reagent that is very effective in leaching gold from low-grade minerals and mining wastes. Therefore, cyanidation is the most widely used method for the extraction of gold from mining wastes. Despite its advantages, is considered an unacceptable and highly hazardous approach.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

What is cyanide and why do we need cyanide-free gold leaching process? Cyanide (CN -) has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide (NaCN), it reacts with gold, oxygen (O), and water (H 2 O) to form a gold cyanide complex (Na [Au(CN) 2] ) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The chemical reaction dubbed the "Elsner Equation", named after its discoverer, is shown below:

gold extraction from tailings without cyanide. Cyanide Free Gold Leaching Alternative. Aug 06, 2015 What is cyanide and why do we need cyanide free gold leaching process Cyanide CN has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide NaCN, it reacts with gold, oxygen O, and water H 2 O to form a gold cyanide complex Na

The standard cyanide leach process consists of grinding the ore to about. 80% - 200 mesh, mixing the ore/water grinding slurry with about 2 pounds. per ton of sodium cyanide and enough quick lime to keep the pH of the solution. at about 11.0. At a slurry concentration of 50% solids, the slurry passes.
