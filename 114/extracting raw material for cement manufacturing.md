## Manufacturing process - Lafarge
Step 1: extraction of raw materials. The raw materials needed to produce cement (calcium carbonate, silica, alumina and iron ore) are generally extracted from limestone rock, chalk, clayey schist or clay. Suitable reserves can be found in most countries. These raw materials are extracted from the quarry by blasting.

## Raw Material Requirement in White Cement Production | AGICO
Requirement of White Cement Raw Material. The mineral composition of white cement clinker is basically the same as that of ordinary portland cement (OPC) clinker, mainly C 3 S and C 2 S. The difference is that there is little iron phase mineral C 4 AF in white cement clinker, which is because Fe 2 O 3 has a great impact on the whiteness of cement.
