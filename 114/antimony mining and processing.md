Up to now, most Antimony-based superlattices photodetectors are based on fully etched mesa-isolated structure. In the processing of such a nonplanarity structure, the passivation via depositing of a dielectric coating on the mesa sidewalls is needed to suppress the surface leakage currents [15,16,17,18].Small bandgaps semiconductors are especially sensitive to the surface leakage currents.
