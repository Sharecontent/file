## What is the Difference Between a Jaw Crusher and a Cone Crusher?
A Jaw crusher is made use of for the function of primary squashing. Hence the rocks fed as input are of plus size. It is able to squash material in the range of 125 mm to 1500 mm. A cone crusher is utilized for second crushing. The input to the cone crusher is a lot smaller and fragmented than that in the jaw crusher.

## The pros and cons of cone crusher applications - Quarry
A measure of the size reduction achieved for a particular crusher application is the reduction ratio. A cone crusher in a secondary crushing application will typically work with a 3.5:1 to 5:1 reduction ratio. Tertiary cone crusher configurations typically work with a reduction ratio of 2.5:1 to 4:1.
