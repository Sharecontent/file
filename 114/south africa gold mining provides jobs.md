## How does the mining sector impact the South African economy?
Mining contributes 11% of gross capital creation but also 16% of total direct foreign investment in South Africa. Despite accounting for just 0.3 percent of taxpayers, the sector was liable for 6 percent of the tax imposed in 2014. Although quarrying employs about 500,000 people, it accounts for barely 5% of the country's employment.

Gold mining companies had an increase of 35% in revenue. Revenue for the 'other mining' segments increased by 7%. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was evident from April 2020, with reductions in revenue being seen across the industry. South African PGMs and gold are mainly mined in deep-level underground mines and were therefore hardest hit.
