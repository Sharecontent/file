## Limestone: Rock Uses, Formation, Composition, Pictures - Geology
Limestone has many other uses. Powdered limestone is used as a filler in paper, paint, rubber, and plastics. Crushed limestone is used as a filter stone in on-site sewage disposal systems. Powdered limestone is also used as a sorbent (a substance that absorbs pollutants) at many coal-burning facilities. Limestone is not found everywhere.

The stone should be as small as possible, but not so small that the bed compacts and seals itself. Jacobs reported that a limestone bed five feet deep and a flow rate of 0.5 to 1 gpm/sq. ft. successfully treated a 50,000 mg/l acidity solution. For more dilute solutions, higher flow rates and shallower beds can be used.
