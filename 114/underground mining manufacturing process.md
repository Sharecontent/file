The process of underground mining is considerably constrained by the geometry and geology of the mine. The various mining operations are normally performed in series at each working face. The delay of a single operation will lead to a domino effect, thus delay the starting time for the next process and the completion time of the entire process.

## Hydraulic fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing, also called fracking, hydrofracking, and hydrofracturing, is a well stimulation technique involving the fracturing of bedrock formations by a pressurized liquid. The process involves the high-pressure injection of "fracking fluid" (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep

## Underground mining - block caving, bore hole, drift fill, hard rock
To facilitate the minerals to be taken out of the mine, the miners construct underground rooms to work in. The mining company selects the best feasible way to get the minerals extracted out. Most mining is carried out using; Continuous mining that employs a continuous mining mechanism to cut the coal deposits from the walls. This means there is less of blasting and drilling and utilizes fewer miners down in the mines.

Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

The openings made in the process of extracting ore are called stopes or rooms. There are two steps involved in stoping. The first is development—that is, preparing the ore blocks for mining—and the second is production, or stoping, itself. Ore development is generally much more expensive on a per-ton basis than stoping, so that every effort is made to maximize the amount of stoping for a given amount of development.
