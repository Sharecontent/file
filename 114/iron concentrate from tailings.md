## Iron Tailings Re-Processing Technology, A New Weapon for Processing 
During the processing of gravity separation to recover iron from iron tailings re-processing, spiral chute is usually used for pre-discarding of iron tailings. The concentrate of the chute usually goes into the regrinding system to improve the dissociation degree of the target mineral for subsequent separation.

The effluent from the tailings from the mining of sulfidic minerals has been described as "the largest environmental liability of the mining industry". These tailings contain large amounts of pyrite (FeS 2) and Iron(II) sulfide (FeS

Iron Concentrate is created by purifying Crushed Iron Ore. This can be done in one of two ways: either dry or wet purification, each of which can be performed using one of two crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time. The process to make Iron Concentrate also gives a by-product of either Tailings or Wet Tailings, each of which are pollutants.
