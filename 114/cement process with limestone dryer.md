## Configuration and Process Flow of Limestone Milling Plant
1. Crushing: Large pieces of limestone are sent into the jaw crusher for coarse crushing by the vibrating feeder, then bottom-up transported into the stock bin by the bucket elevator. 2. Grinding: The crushed limestone in the stock bin is evenly sent into the limestone grinding mill for the grinding operation.
