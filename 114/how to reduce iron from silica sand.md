## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
How Silica Sand Is Different From Regular Sand. Regular sand, also known as feldspathic sand, brown sand, or construction sand, will always contain some silica, but only in amounts less than 95%. For example, typical brown sand used for concrete applications can contain up to 80% SiO2, along with varying amounts of iron, carbonate, potassium
