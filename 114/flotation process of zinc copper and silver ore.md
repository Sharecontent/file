According to the design project of a lead-zinc ore concentrator in Tibet undertaken by Xinhai mining equipment, the lead grade of oxidized ore is about 5% and that of zinc is about 15%. In addition, it also contains 80.4g/t of silver and 0.2g/t of gold. The oxidation rate of lead and zinc is 12.81% and 15.15% respectively.

In this particular ore, the metals are present in the oxidised form. Obtaining metals from this ore is much easier. For example, Haematite ore ( Iron) and Bauxite ore (Aluminium) Sulphide Ores - In this particular ore, the metals are present in the sulphide form. Since it is difficult to extract metals from this ore, they are usually converted to oxides with the process of

Such ores containing multiple metals such as lead, copper and zinc can be selectively extracted by using froth floatation. The minerals that do not float into the froth are called the flotation tailings or flotation tails. The froth flotation process was first patented by H. F. K. Pickard, E.

## copper froth flotation
Froth flotation is part of a copper beneficiation process in which finely ground ore is placed in aerated tanks that contain a water-based solution from which a copper-sulfide-rich froth is recovered through the use of a combination of physical and chemical interactions. The remaining non-ore minerals (tailings) are disposed of (Herbst and Pate
