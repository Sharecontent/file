## Natural sand vs Manufactured sand - NISCHINTH
Natural sand / River sand has been used in construction for many centuries. Recently for past few years due to various reasons, we have to use manufactured sand / crushed sand. Let's discuss about the properties and applications of manufactured sand comparing with Natural sand. 1. Sourcing: Natural sand is sourced from river beds. Process.

The manufactured sand has required gradation of fines, physical properties such as shape, smooth surface textures and consistency which makes it the best sand suitable for construction. These physical properties of sand provides greater strength to the concrete by reducing segregation, bleeding, honeycombing, voids and capillary.

The preparation of manufactured sand consists of basic process; Extracting. Aggregate crushing. Screening and sorting. Air classifying. Storage and handling. The manufacturing process for M sand takes place in three stages: First stage- crushing stones of varying sizes into aggregates using vertical shaft impact (VSI) crushers.

## Multi-scale creep analysis of river sand and manufactured sand concrete 
This paper investigated the multi-scale prediction of long-term creep in river sand (RS) concrete and manufactured sand (MS) concrete and analyzed the effect of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around the aggregate on the creep properties of concrete. Uniaxial compressive creep tests were conducted on the concrete for a duration of 360 d.

## Study on strength characteristics of concrete using M-Sand and coconut 
It is obtained from various granite quarries. Manufactured-sand or M-sand is slowly replacing the fine aggregate in the concrete as the sand is well graded and gives higher strength of concrete. There are various fibers used for reinforcing concrete which consist mainly of artificial or steel fibers.
