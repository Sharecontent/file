The final quality of the iron ore in mineral processing is tied to the efficiency of its beneficiation process, which can be optimized when the composition of the iron ore is known.  A procedure for automatic classification of hematite in iron ore is proposed in this paper. OM images obtained in different contrast modes are processed and

## Characterization of Chemical Composition and Microstructure of Natural 
Certain hematite ores with high iron content (65-70% Fe), including most of Muko ores, can be used directly in blast furnace for iron making without beneficiation and agglomeration and in direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) process. Moreover, most hematite deposits require little beneficiation and can be direct-shippable ore (DSO). 4. Conclusions

## Study on beneficiation process scheme of a small hematite ore
Feb 3, 2022front It is said that hematite accounts for a considerable proportion in China's iron ore resources. Compared with magnetite, most hematite has fine embedded particle size, large mud content and great difficulty in beneficiation. Therefore, since the sixth five year plan, China has regarded hematite as a national scientific research project and achieved fruitful results.

The principal separation in iron ore beneficiation, therefore, is between the iron minerals, hematite and/or magnetite, and silica, principally in the form of quartz. The use of flotation, either alone or in combination with magnetic separation, has been well established as an efficient method for rejecting silica from these iron ores.

Hematite is often cheaper to process than other forms of iron ore as it generally does not require beneficiation due to its higher iron content. However, hematite ores may contain higher concentrations of contaminant elements (such as phosphorus, alumina and silica) and may therefore need to be blended prior to smelting.

## Beneficiation of an iron ore fines by magnetization roasting and 
The hematite and siderite are almost completely converted into magnetite by 8 wt% coal at roasting temperature of 800 °C for 8 min. Under the optimized conditions, a high grade magnetic concentrate containing 65.4 wt% iron with an iron recovery of 92.7% was achieved. Meanwhile, the effects of roasting temperature, reaction time and coal to ore
