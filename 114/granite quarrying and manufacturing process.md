## Project Report on GRANITE MINING - Manufacturing Process - Books 
The crystals in granite are large because granite crystallized slowly from molten rock (magma), over 2 km below the Earth's surface. Where the same magma escaped upwards, and was erupted through fissures or volcanoes, it crystallized rapidly, forming small crystals or glass, and produced volcanic rocks.
