The shortage has driven the price of cement, one of the primary ingredients. Portland Cement (PC) is a fine powder which is produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln and forms clinker. The clinker is grinded to fine powder with addition of small amount of other materials. It is the most commonly used types of cement in the world

The answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.

## role of limestone crushers in cement making
Cement Making Plant. In the course of cement processing plant, limestone is the largest amount of raw materials for cement production, the larger the particle size after mining, high hardness, thus crushing the material crushing limestone cement making plant occupies a more important position In the cement making plant, fine jaw crusher for cement clinker
