## v0.34:Dolomite - Dwarf Fortress Wiki
Dolomite is a white medium-value and economic type of sedimentary stone that forms entire layers. It is also a flux stone, meaning it can be used in the production of pig iron and steel.Additionally, it is magma safe, with an extremely high melting point of 16507 °U, in fact, the highest melting point of all common stones, barring raw adamantine (and, because it cannot be melted, slade 1).
