## Comprehensive Remote Sensing Technology for Monitoring Landslide 
The Xishan coal mine area in Beijing, China has a long history of mining. Many landslide hazards, in addition to collapses and ground fractures, have occurred in this area. This study used multi-temporal satellite images to extract this region's deformation information, identify landslides and analyze the deformation evolution process of these landslides.

The Yuanjiawan landslide is a bedded rock landslide triggered by cutting the high and steep slope in the process of building Lanzhou-Lintao Expressway in Gansu Province. Under the influence and control of the complexity of the natural environment and various human activities in the course of slope transformation, the landslide occurs during excavation and exertion of the expressway.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of horizontal excavation 
Support the excavation as you go along. Prevent people and materials falling in - with barriers strong enough not to collapse if someone falls against them. Keep plant and materials away from the edge. Avoid underground services - use relevant service drawings, service locating devices and safe digging practice.

## Landslide | National Geographic Society
Jul 15, 2022A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a sloped section of land. Landslides are caused by rain, earthquakes, volcanoes, or other factors that make the slope unstable. Geologists, scientists who study the physical formations of the Earth, sometimes describe landslides as one type of mass wasting.A mass wasting is any downward movement in which the Earth's surface is worn away.

## landslide in the excavation process
Landslides triggered by excavation in the loess plateau of Mar 01, 2019 The excavation slope inclinations and soil properties significantly affected the failure process and division of the slope. The characteristics, that excavation-induced loess landslides always occur in hysteresis and abruptness, were interpreted by the analysis of the

## A thrust load-caused landslide triggered by excavation of  - DeepDyve
This paper describes the slide mechanism of the Chaancun Landslide, which is the second largest landslide to have occurred in northeast China. The damage caused by the landslide poses a threat to a road with heavy traffic, endangers local residents, has created the potential for a reservoir dam-break, and may trigger other secondary disasters. The landslide has caused $7.35 million of losses
