## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
With the depleting reserves of high-grade iron ore in the world, froth flotation has become increasingly important to process intermediate- and low-grade iron ore in an attempt to meet the rapidly growing demand on the international market. In over half a century's practice in the iron ore industry, froth flotation has been established as an efficient method to remove impurities from iron ore.
