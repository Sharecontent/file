## Concrete Properties, Testing & Standards
The compressive strength of concrete is measured by testing cubes or cylinders in a laboratory. In Ireland, the standard practice is to use 150mm or 100mm cubes rather than cylinders, which are more common in some European countries. Concrete strength increases with time where moisture is available. However, it is accepted that around 80% of

## Concrete Aggregates- Functions,properties, Characteristics and  - Happho
Crushing strength, impact value abrasion resistance, and elastic modulus of aggregate are interrelated properties that are greatly influenced by porosity. Aggregates from natural sources that are commonly used for making normal-weight concrete, are generally dense and strong; therefore they are seldom a limiting factor to strength and elastic

## An Investigation On Strength Properties Of Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete
Figure 7 show comparison of UPV compressive strength with cube crushing strength at all testing ages. It is clear from both figures that UPV compressive strength values are less than actual strength (cube crushing strength). Figure 7. Comparison of 56-days Cube and UPV compressive strength with glass fibre content. Split cylinder strength
