## Coal Production | Alberta Energy Regulator
In 2021, total production of marketable coal decreased by 30 per cent from 2020 (see Table S7.1). As shown in Figure S7.1, subbituminous coal production slowed significantly in 2021. Thermal and metallurgical coal production also fell in 2021 as the Coal Valley mine Grande Cache mine were temporarily closed for most of the year.
