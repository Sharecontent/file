The use of copper equipment during the prefermentation and fermentation steps typically result in some leaching of copper. Because copper is an essential nutrient for yeast growth, low levels of copper are metabolized by the yeast during fermentation. However, studies have shown that copper levels above 0.2 mg/L are toxic or lethal to the yeast.

Copper has been used for about 10,000 years and more. An axe was made in 3300 BCE for Otzi the Iceman. 2. At that time when the axe was found, the head was made of almost pure copper. It was said that this indicates the iceman was directly involved with the process of smelting copper. 3. The coloring of copper is metallic-reddish and unique.
