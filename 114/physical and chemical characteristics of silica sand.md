## What is sand? Composition & Types of Sand - Civil Engineering
Composition & Types of Sand. Sand is a mixture of small grains of rock and granular materials which is mainly defined by size, being finer than gravel and coarser than silt. And ranging in size from 0.06 mm to 2 mm. Particles which are larger than 0. mm but smaller than 0.0625 mm are termed silt. Sand is made by erosion or broken pebbles

## Silica Physical Properties - nanoComposix
The density of silica nanoparticles is approximately 2 g/cm 3 and depends on the degree of condensation. Colloidal silica is amorphous or non-crystalline, meaning that the atoms do not have long-range order, similar to the atomic structure of bulk glass. As prepared, they are readily suspended in polar solvents such as water and ethanol.

Sources of Silica Sand: SiO2 is the chemical sign of silica and it is actually the group of minerals which is a mixture of Oxygen and Silicon. This sand is often got in the crystalline state and because of weathering, plankton fossilization takes place and that results in crystallizing SiO2. In most regions of the world, these are found as mines and it is obtained in high hardness.
