## Explain in detail the processes involved in the production of pig iron 
Pig iron can be moulded into different types of shapes. Steel making is defined as a process used for the production of steel from scrap and iron ore. In this process, impurities like sulphur, nitrogen, silicon and excess carbonate are removed from sourced iron. Siemens - Martin and Bessemer have turned steel making into a heavy industry.

## Steel production: from iron ore to functional industrial products. - Vepica
How steel is made. First, the raw materials, either iron ore or scrap iron (depending on the process), are converted into molten steel. The ore-based process uses a blast furnace or smelter and the scrap-based process uses an electric arc furnace. Next, the molten steel is poured and solidified in a continuous caster.

Cast iron begins its life as pig iron, which is remelted and often combined with large amounts of scrap iron and sometimes with steel. Contaminants are removed from the melted pig iron, and the iron, once melted, is then cast. Casting is the process of pouring the iron into a mold thus giving it a shape. Molds and pouring methods divide this
