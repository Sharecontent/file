## How to Choose the Right Concrete Grinding Contractor - AllStar Concrete
There are two types of grinders: walk-behind and handheld. Some of the higher-quality walks behind concrete floor grinders have a grinding width of 21 inches, while others can grind a 32-inch section of your floor in a single pass. Handheld grinders are used in tighter spaces, such as close to walls and near corners.
