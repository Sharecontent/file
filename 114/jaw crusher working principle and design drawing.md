This article tells the differences mainly from three aspects: structures, working principle and selection. Though they do the same function in crushing rocks, the structures of the two types are different. The double-toggle jaw crusher consists of a swing jaw, a stationary jaw, an offset eccentric shaft, a pivot point and a double set of toggles.

March 28, 2019 / in News. A jaw crusher is a large piece of equipment that's used in mine and ore processing plants to crush rocks. The equipment was first introduced back in 1858 by inventor Eli Whitey Black who primarily developed machinery used for crushing stone. From there, jaw crushers have seen plenty of action in the pit and quarry

Cone crushers and jaw crushers both work by compression, reducing materials by squeezing them until they break apart.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

/ the working principle of jaw crushers All jaw crushers feature two jaws: one of which is fixed while the other moves. The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws.
