The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below. Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production. Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).

## Iron Ore | Today's Spot Price & Charts - Market Index
Iron Ore (Fe) is mined in around 50 countries worldwide and used to make steel (buildings, cars, white goods etc.). Global economic growth is the primary factor that drives its supply and demand. When economies are growing, the need for steel in construction increases which drives the price up.

Iron Ore (fines) Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, deep purple, to rusty red. The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ), hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite
