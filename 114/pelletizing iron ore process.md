During pelletizing, ore powder is rolled into iron ore green pellets in rotating drums together with water, binding agents and additives. Globules with grain sizes of approx. 15 mm are produced, which are then baked into porous pellets. Pellets are mainly produced by special ore suppliers and then delivered to the ironworks.
