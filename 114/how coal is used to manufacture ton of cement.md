## Cement has a carbon problem. Here are some concrete solutions.
To make cement, you have to heat limestone to nearly 1,500 degrees C. Unfortunately, the most efficient way to get a cement kiln that hot is to burn lots of coal, which, along with other fossil

## how coal is used to manufacture ton of cement
May 09, 2012 Cement manufacturing is highly energy- and emissions-intensive because of the extreme heat required to produce it. Producing a ton of cement requires 4.7 million BTU of energy, equivalent to about 400 pounds of coal, and generates nearly a ton of CO 2. Given its high emissions and critical importance to society, cement is an obvious place to

## Cement Plants: Coal
London coal gas production began in 1813 and by 1842 was producing 300,000 tons of coke a year, so coke was also readily available, and, being essentially a waste product, was cheaper than coal. Early cement plants used coal for drying slurry and for power generation, and coke for kiln burning. Per tonne of clinker produced, consumption was

The coking process consists of heating coking coal to around ºC in the absence of oxygen to drive off the volatile compounds (pyrolysis). This process results in a hard porous material - coke. Coke is produced in a coke battery which is composed of many coke ovens stacked in rows into which coal is loaded.

## Cement Plants: Coke
Coal-derived coke was the fuel used in most static kilns and so was the dominant fuel in the cement industry in the nineteenth century. Coal could not be used in static kilns in which the fuel is fed in with the raw material, mainly because, during the gradual heat-up of the charge, the fuel's volatiles are lost without ignition, so wasting up

Coking coal is converted to coke by driving off impurities to leave almost pure carbon. The coking coal is crushed and washed. It is then 'purified' or 'carbonised' in a series of coke ovens, known as batteries, where the coking coal is heated to ºC in the absence of oxygen for 12-36 hours. During this process, by-products are

Cement kilns are used for the pyroprocessing stage of manufacture of portland and other types of hydraulic cement, in which calcium carbonate reacts with silica-bearing minerals to form a mixture of calcium silicates.Over a billion tonnes of cement are made per year, and cement kilns are the heart of this production process: their capacity usually defines the capacity of the cement plant.
