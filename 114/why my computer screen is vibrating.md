## why does my computer screen keep shaking
Shaking or trembling of a computer screen is often caused by interference from another device that is within a couple feet. It can also be caused by another monitor close by. If the removal of these objects does not stop the trembling, the monitor may have built up magnetism and need to be degaussed.
