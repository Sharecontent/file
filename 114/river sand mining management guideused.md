Sand mining is the extraction of sand, mainly through an open pit but sometimes mined from beaches and inland dunes or dredged from ocean and river beds. It is mainly used in construction and often in manufacturing as an abrasive or in concrete (Mensah 1997 ). Mining activity targets different sources as some uses require higher purity and

Irresponsible sand mining is also a huge threat to the river banks, bridges, and nearby structures. It also affects the contiguous groundwater system and the usages that local residents make of the river. Sand mining can be responsible for the destruction of riparian and aquatic habitat through huge changes in the channel morphology.

## Sand mining is stealing the minerals from Chinese rivers
February 11, 2021. The world's largest extractive industry gets little attention. Each year up to 50 billion tonnes of sand and gravel - known collectively as aggregate - are mined from rivers, lakes, oceans and hillsides. As it is the main ingredient in concrete and tarmac, our cities and roads are literally built on sand.
