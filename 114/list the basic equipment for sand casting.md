Generally, iron content must be reduced to 0.030% Fe2O3 or less. &. Silica sand for making glass, pottery and ceramics must meet rigid specifications and generally standard washing schemes are inadequate for meeting these requirements. Sand for the glass industry must contain not more than 0.03% Fe2O3.

## Sand Casting: Construction, Types, Applications, and Advantages
Casting is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Casting materials include metal, concrete, epoxy, plaster, and clay. This article will focus on sand casting. The versatility of the sand casting process is well recognized.

The basic premise of sand casting. Sand casting can be done into any earthen space that will hold its shape around molten metal. In this video, liquid aluminum is poured into an abandoned fire ant nest. After the metal cools it is unearthed and cleaned, and the resulting casting has captured the shape of the habitat.

The sand casting equipment uses air pressure or hydraulic pressure to press the molding sand in the sandbox through the indenter or pattern to compact the molding sand. The pressure is generally 0.25 to 0.4 MPa. This kind of sand casting equipment makes the sand mold far away from the pressure surface poorly compact. In the early 1950s, a high
