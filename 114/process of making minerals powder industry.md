This process is called 'comminution' or 'size reduction.'. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. Most mineral processing operations are conducted with water as the medium; this is called wet processing against dry processing. Crushing, grinding, milling, and vibration (feeding) are examples of comminution processes.
