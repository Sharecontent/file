It is the process of reducing the thickness or changing the cross section of a long work-piece by compressive forces applied through a set of rolls rotating in the opposite direction. The rolling operation takes a solid piece of metal and breaks it down successively in several steps into different shapes such as flats, rounds, and sections etc.

Rolling Process: Definition, Working, Application, Defects, Type of Rolling Mills [PDF] Written by Anup Kumar Dey in Manufacturing Process. Rolling is the deformation process of a metal that is widely used in the metal forming process. It is done by passing the strip of the metal between the rollers. This paper discussion will be made about the rolling process, the working principle of the rolling process along with that the working principle of the rolling mills.

## Rolling Process: Definition, Working Principle, Application, and 
The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.

## rolling milling machine process
A process which evolved in countless machine shops around the world, rotary filing reduced the time and energy previously spent on hand-filing by placing a circular cutter lined with teeth in a lathe's headstock. Roughly 200 years ago, the first tools solely dedicated to the milling machine process appeared in the shops of American craftsmen.

The advantages of Rolling process are as follows. By rolling, uniform dimensions of the components can be obtained. It uses the same tool in the sense, the same rollers are responsible for the production of various components. Close tolerance is possible for the components in the rolling. high-speed production takes place in the rolling.
