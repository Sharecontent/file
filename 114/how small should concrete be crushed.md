## Can You Use Old Concrete As Fill for New Concrete? - Your Own Architect
You can use old concrete as fill for new concrete to create aggregate to add bulk, compressive strength, and stability, as well as for recycling purposes. Crush the old concrete or hire a company to remove it and smash it into small pieces. Clean and recycle the concrete by adding it to the new concrete's mix before you pour it.

## How Thick Should Driveway Pavers Be? - September - 2022
For most garden pathways, pavers should be around 60 mm (or 2 3/8 inches) thick. In order to achieve this, you need to ensure that the excavated soil site, filled with crushed concrete and bedding sand, creates a paver base that distributes the weight evenly. If pavers are at least 50 mm (2 inches) thick, this will be enough to prevent damage.

Retaining Walls. Layering crushed concrete is also a great way to create a retaining wall and control erosion on slopes or hills in your yard. Different sizes of crushed concrete can function together to help prevent erosion. A layer of smaller, more broken-up crushed concrete as a base will contribute to the stability of the wall.

The rigidity of crushed stone makes it an ideal base material to support concrete if you have cracking concerns. But don't be fooled. Your concrete will crack, guaranteed. But a good rigid and compacted base will keep the individual mini-continents from shifting. The concrete doesn't need to adhere to the stone base, there is no advantage to that.

Recycled crushed concrete begins by breaking down original structures. This can include just about any of the normal concrete structures that would go into landfills, like building slabs, curbs, foundation, and any sort of concrete structure. The breakdown begins by using industrial crushing equipment to demolish the existing structure.

New concrete can be poured over old concrete as long as it is done properly. About two inches thick of new concrete should be poured. Aside from that, it is recommended to use smaller aggregate and to use reinforcement like fiber into the concrete. If the slab is so thick that it makes it hard to use fiber, you can opt for a steel rebar.
