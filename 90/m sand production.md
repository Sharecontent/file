The bulk density of crushed sand is 1.75 gm/cm 3.; The specific gravity of crushed sand is 2.5 to 2.9 and it depends on the parent rock. While using Crushed sand in concrete there is no need to bulkage correction during mix design. The ability to old surface moisture of Crushed sand is up to 10%. It has less adulteration than the river sand It causes less damage to the environment as compared
