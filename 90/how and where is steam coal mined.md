## First new coal mine in Colorado sparks economic hope in Trinidad
The New Elk mine near Trinidad originally opened 70 years ago to provide coking coal for conglomerate Colorado Fuel & Iron's steel works in Pueblo. When the steel mill began replacing coal-fired furnaces and coke ovens with electric systems in the 70s and 80s, the New Elk Mine began slowing its production. In the late 1980s and early 1990s

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

Once this has been confirmed, mining operations begin. As coal reserves are found across the globe, the largest coal producing regions are not confined to one region - the top five hard coal producers are China, India, USA, Indonesia and Australia. Most coal production is actually used in the country in which it was produced.

Here the coal seams were close to the surface, but an overland haul of three miles could add 60 per cent. to the cost of the coal, and mining had to remain close to the river. The mining expansion was mainly in terms of deeper shafts, most over 15 fathoms deep, and drainage of water from the pits was helped by the new German pumping techniques.

## Question: How Was Coal Mined In The Industrial Revolution
Surface mining and deep underground mining are the two basic methods of mining. The choice of mining method depends primarily on depth, density, overburden, and thickness of the coal seam; seams relatively close to the surface, at depths less than approximately 55 m (180 ft), are usually surface mined.

Over the past decade and a half it transformed Australian. Coal shafts could go hundreds of feet into the ground. Once a coal seam was found, the miners dug horizontally. However, underground the miners faced very real and great dangers. Even with Watt's improved steam engine, gas flooding was a real problem in mines.

A steam engine is a machine that burns coal to release the heat energy it contains—so it's an example of what we call a heat engine. It's a bit like a giant kettle sitting on top of a coal fire.

## The Life and Death of King Coal in South Wales | British Heritage
The iron mines died, replaced by giant iron and steel works that used Welsh coal to refine imported ore. It was a portent of the future, as the Welsh coal seams were just as thin, contorted and faulted as the iron seams. No one noticed, however, as there was never enough Welsh steam coal to fuel the steam engines of the world.
