Here are the steps in developing an aggregate plan: Step 1 Identify the aggregate plan that matches your company's objectives: level, chase, or hybrid. Step 2 Based on the aggregate plan, determine the aggregate production rate. If you use the level plan with inventories and back orders, the aggregate production rate is set equal to average demand.
