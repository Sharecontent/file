## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.
