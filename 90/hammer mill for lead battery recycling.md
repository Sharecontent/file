## Scrap Battery Recycling: What You Need to Know
When it comes to lead-acid battery recycling, the battery first goes through a grinding process. The battery needs to be fully shattered, so it's often sent to the hammer mill. The next step is to neutralise the acid content, which is sulphuric acid, by putting the hammered pieces in a vat. Separating lead and polymers is easy at this point
