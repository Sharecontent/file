Gray Iron. Gray iron, or gray cast iron, is named after the gray color of the fracture it forms, which is due to the presence of flake graphite. It is the oldest and most common cast iron and the most widely used cast material based on weight. It is used for housings where the stiffness of the component is more important than its tensile.

It is also ductile . It is corrosion resistant when compared to other forms of iron and is easy to weld. These properties are used in the production of different items. Wrought iron is composed of 1-2% of added slag.  Wrought Iron : Wrought iron contains about 0.08% carbon . Steel : Steel > contains about 2-4% of carbon.

## Ductile iron vs carbon steel valvesyrawa.pl
Ductile iron is an alloy of carbon and iron, as is steel . In general, it can be said that an alloy with a carbon percentage less than 1.7% is a steel, and if it is higher, a cast iron or cast iron . The 1.7% limit makes a lot of metallographic sense, as it marks the limit at which the solidification process generates austenite.

Austempering is an isothermal heat treatment process which significantly improves both the strength and wear resistance of ductile iron whilst retaining the impact resistance and ductility for which the material is noted. Austempered Ductile Iron was introduced in the 1950s, but it was commercialized and achieved success only some years later.

## Ductile iron vs carbon steel corrosion resistance
On average, steel will be 2.5x denser than aluminum. There are lighter forms of steel, such as mild steel, that weigh less than carbon steels . However, mild steels that weigh the same as aluminum are not as strong and are more susceptible to breaks and cracks. Because aluminum extrusions weigh less than most other metals, this makes it easier.

A PC-controlled vacuum heat treating system was used to austemper an alloyed ductile iron with 0.77%Cu and 0.5%Ni at 400°C after austenitizing at 850°C. During the progress of isothermal transformation, the resistivity of austempered ductile iron vs. time was recorded and then analyzed to determine the processing window.
