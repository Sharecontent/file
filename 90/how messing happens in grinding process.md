## Guide to Blanchard and Precision Grinding Process - CREATINGWAY
Blanchard Grinding. We use Blanchard grinding in finishing large portions of plate stock, die blocks, rotatory table and stampings. It is a process that arose and was named after the Blanchard Machine Company of Cambridge. This system provides a quick and uniquely cost-effective method for cutting away large metal shards over a large surface area.

## Centerless Grinding Process | Total Grinding Solutions (TGS)
Centerless grinding is the process of removing material from the outside diameter of a work piece using an abrasive wheel. In its simplest form, a centerless grinder consists of the machine base, grinding wheel, regulating wheel and work blade. With centerless grinding, the work piece is not mechanically held to drive the part.

Then, pick a spot and push the blade into the belt with your thumb. You see the grind line move up right there. One other thing to think about: The more metal in contact with the belt, the slower it grinds. So, as you approach the tip and pull the tang back, there's a lot less metal in contact with the belt.

## What Happens To Roots After Stump Grinding?
Sep 8, 2022The process of stump grinding usually starts with the removal of the tree trunk. Once the trunk is gone, the grinder moves in and starts working on the roots. The vast majority of tree roots are located in the top 12 inches of soil, so that's where the grinder will do most of its work.

As the table moves back and forth, the entire table moves so that over time, the grinding wheel passes over the entire surface area of the table. This process, while slow, is precise. With each pass, as much as 0.001" of material is removed. The maximum thickness to be removed using this process is 0.008". Otherwise, milling should be used.
