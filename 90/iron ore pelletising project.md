## Iron Ore Pelletizing Essential in Meeting Future Steel Needs
Benefits of Pelletized Iron Ore. In addition to the factors listed above, iron ore pellets also offer a number of benefits to steel producers, some of which include: Improved productivity per cubic meter of blast furnace 1. Lower emissions and dust compared to sinter 1. Reduced requirement of coking coal. Improved handling and transportation.

## The Iron Pelletizing Process: Part One :: Total Materia Article
The pelletizing process is a process which contains numerous sub-processes, or process segments. On the way from the mine to a final product, the iron ore goes through the following main process segments: 1) The iron ore is crushed and the waste rock is removed. About 85 % of the particles should be less than 44 μm (in length, width, or height).

During the process, the pellets are subjected to various compressive forces and temperature changes, which cause ruptures in their surface.  Iron ore pellets are produced by the agglomeration of fines
