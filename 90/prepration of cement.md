## Why Concrete Surface Preparation Is Important - Polycote
This method of industrial floor preparation is widely regarded as the most professional and most effective surface preparation method for concrete is a light blast with a Vacuum Assisted Shotblaster. The objective is the same as acid etching. The blast removes all form release agents, weak concrete, laitance, dirt and contamination.

Here are six concrete safety hazards to prepare for as you set up your work zone. 1. Chemical Burns. Direct contact with wet concrete can cause chemical burns and other skin problems to quickly develop. The caustic chemicals in Portland cement cause these injuries by directly pulling moisture out of the skin and damaging the sensitive cells.

• Poor site preparation can cause driveway cracking in the first couple of years after construction, typically due to inadequate soil compaction before placing the concrete . Concrete is strong in compression because the small and large aggregate stones in the mix can carry large loads. However it is weak in tension (bending).

## Inspection of the Precast Concrete Surface Preparation and Coating 
Precast concrete is cleaned and painted for both beautification and protection. Painting may involve the use of protective coatings, stains, or water repellents. For the materials to adhere and provide the desired service life, the quality of surface preparation and application must be assured. This can be accomplished by thoroughly inspecting each phase of the work.
