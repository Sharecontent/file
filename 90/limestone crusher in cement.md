## Crushed Limestone Concrete Aggregate | Texas Crushed Stone Co.
Studies have shown that this thermal stability coupled with limestone's superior curing properties results in greater crack spacing, and less crack width in limestone concrete slabs. Most concrete is made by mixing a ¼" to 200 mesh (200 wires per inch) sand with aggregate graded from 1 ½" to 3/8" or aggregate graded from 1 ¼" to 3/

## Crushed Limestone - Uses & Benefits of This Natural Stone
Crushed limestone grits have lighter unit weight compared to limestone gravels and other natural stones. So, it approximately saves 12% of the total volume needed in the preparation of cement-concrete mixture for construction purposes. Compared to gravel concrete, crushed limestone concrete has a lower thermal coefficient of expansion.
