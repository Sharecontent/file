## Aggregate Washing - PowerX Equipment
Aggregate Washing. The washing of aggregates is required for many markets and applications. Nowadays the finished product needs to meet specifications outlined by the ever stringent and demanding world markets. Where dry screening was accepted in the past, washing and scrubbing are now required to produce a silt free product.

## Assessing benefits of pre-soaked recycled concrete aggregate on 
These benefits may improve the characteristics of an acceptable mix, or potentially counteract some of the negative qualities associated with the use of some RCAs in concrete. 2. Objectives.  The two aggregate types represent two ends of the RCA-quality spectrum. They have both been included in this research to gauge the relative IC effects
