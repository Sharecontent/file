Process Hematite Mining Triple Helix Co Za.hematite mining fundamentals. hematite can also occur as a result of volcanic activity claysized hematite crystals occur as a secondary mineral along with oxyhydroxides such as goethite or other iron oxides as a result of the weathering process in soil the most common deposits of hematite are sedimentary deposits such as the lake superior district in

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction - GREAT MINING
The iron by its own is usually found in the structure of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4), hematite (Fe 2 O 3), goethite, limonite or siderite. Hematite is also identified as "natural ore". The nomenclature dates back to the early years of drawing out, when certain hematite ores comprised 66% iron and could be fed reliably into iron edifice blast furnaces.
