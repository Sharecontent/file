## Methods and Techniques of Uranium Mining | nuclear-power
As with other types of hard rock mining, there are several extraction methods. In the case of uranium mining, it strongly depends on the concentration of uranium in the ore. For example, the ore extracted from the Australian Olympic Dam Mine has a concentration of 0.05 %, and most reserves have uranium with a concentration of between 0.1 bis 0.2 %.
