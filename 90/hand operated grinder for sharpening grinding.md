## How To Sharpen Meat Grinder Blades And Plates With Steps
Get the blade or plates and position it in a direction while firmly holding it. Gently rub the blades or plates against the sandpaper in a way that enables it to touch the sandpaper in the right manner. Keep rubbing and while at it, you can rotate it around so all the sides get sharpened. Do this one at a time.

## Free- Hand Sharpening
This makes it particularly easy to sharpen. Simply seat the bevel as described above and then rotate the tool. If the handle is dropped about 15º below horizontal, you can watch for sparks to come across the top of the bevel. This will serve as an indication that you're grinding all the way to the cutting edge.
