pH Range: The cardinal tetra can stand a pH range that is neutral or slightly acidic. Water that is between 5.5 - 7.5 pH is perfectly acceptable. But like the temperature, some variation can be forgiven. Hardness: A water hardness of anywhere in the range of 2 - 6 KH will still allow these tetras to thrive.
