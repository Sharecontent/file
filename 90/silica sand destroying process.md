 · The silica sand is an assemblage of individual silica grains in the size range upto 2 mm. Sand can be formed in nature by natural weathering of sandstone and quartzite or mechanically by crushing a sandstone /quartzite or by a process of flotation whereby the various constituents in a pegmatite or kaolin mixture are separated.

To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.
