## Aluminium and its alloys ppt-beach-radio
Aluminum is a lightweight metal and its alloys are used in the aerospace industry. These alloys are used for making bodies of aircrafts and to form high strength parts for jet engines. These parts deal with the extremities of temperature, pressure and vibration. They provide high strength and the ability to function at very high temperatures.

## Disadvantages of ductile iron pipe-bau-immobilien
Ductile iron has a greater resistance to impacts, and is able to resist a minimum of 7 foot pounds of impact (versus 2 pounds of impact for gray iron ). This means that while ductile iron can be used in critical applications that involve impact, gray iron has limits that prohibit it from being used for certain purposes.

## Removal of Phosphorus from High Phosphorus Iron Ores in Wushan Mountain 
In the process of resource utilization of high phosphorus iron ores, phosphorus should be removed first. Compared to other dephosphorization methods, selective leaching with acid has special advantages such as high dephosphorization ratio, low iron loss and so on. However, a large amount of acidic wastewater containing phosphorus was produced after acid leaching.

Nov 16, 2020The possibility of selective solid-phase reduction of iron from oolitic ore has been experimentally confirmed. Solid phase reduction was carried out at temperatures of 850 and 1000°C in a CO atmosphere and in a mixture with solid carbon. Distribution of iron and phosphorus was investigated with a scanning electron microscope.

## what is percentage of phosphorus and sulphur in iron ores
The ore minerals in silicate iron ores are iron chlorites, usually accompanied by hydrous ferric oxides, and sometimes by siderite (25-40 percent iron). There is a negligible content of sulfur and up to 0.9-1.0 percent phosphorus. Silicate ores form beds and lenses in friable sedimentary rocks.
