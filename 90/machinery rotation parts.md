## Rotating Machinery - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
When rotating machinery is inoperative, this affects its associated systems and industrial complexes. In 1985, the Electric Power Research Institute estimated that 40% of stoppages at fossil-fuel stations in North America were due to rotating machinery problems, and in France the loss due to disruptions in 900-MW turboalternators was equivalent to the energy produced by a 750-MW machine.

## Balancing rotating elements in machines | Cutting Tool Engineering
The rotating elements in machine tools often generate unacceptable forces due to unbalance, and manufacturers usually take corrective action to reduce the forces. While it is unusual for end users to perform field balancing, manufacturers of machine tools, spindles, cutting tools, toolholders and other rotating equipment do it routinely.

## What is rotating electric machine - Student Circuit
9th April 2018 by Joe Bush. Rotating electrical machine consists of a stator, rotor and the air gap between them. Stator and rotor has windings . The rotor is installed into the stem, and the stem connects to the motor and any other loads. The windings are there to carry the electrical current that generates magnetic fields for the electrical load.

## eTool : Machine Guarding - Introduction - Hazardous Motions/Actions 
Rotating motion can be dangerous; even smooth, slowly rotating shafts can grip hair and clothing, and through minor contact force the hand and arm into a dangerous position. Injuries due to contact with rotating parts can be severe. Collars, couplings, cams, clutches, flywheels, shaft ends, spindles, meshing gears, and horizontal or vertical shafting are some examples of common rotating
