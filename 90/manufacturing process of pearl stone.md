Summary. Manufacturing is a system in which raw materials are transformed into finished products while adding value in the process. While individuals traditionally added value to raw materials by altering their structure, refining, and processing them into more useful finished products, the 19th century Industrial Revolution led to the mechanization of the manufacturing process.

The Chinese began pearl design in the twelfth century by cementing tiny Buddhas carved from wood, stone, or ivory or cast from metal inside the shells of freshwater mussels. The Buddhas became coated with nacre, or pearlized, and were a successful product. This practice still thrives in Chinese pearl culturing.

Potassium carbonate (K 2 CO 3) cannot be manufactured by solvay process because potassium bicarbonate (KHCO 3) fairly soluble in water. In sodium carbonate manufacturing, first sodium bicarbonate is precipitated, then Na 2 CO 3 is produced. But due to higher solubility of KHCO 3, K 2 CO 3 is unable to manufacture by solvay process.
