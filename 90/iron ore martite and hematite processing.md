## iron processing - Ores | Britannica
Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

## How Is Iron Extracted From Its Ore - Realonomics
They are reduction of the ore with carbon reduction of the molten ore by electrolysis and reduction of the ore with a more reactive metal. Why can iron be extracted from its ore using carbon? This method of extraction works because carbon is more reactive than iron so it can displace iron from iron compounds. In the reaction of iron(III) oxide

## Martite vs. Hematite - What's the difference? | Ask Difference
Hematite noun. An important ore of iron, the sesquioxide, so called because of the red color of the powder. It occurs in splendent rhombohedral crystals, and in massive and earthy forms; - the last called red ocher. Called also specular iron, oligist iron, rhombohedral iron ore, and bloodstone. See Brown hematite, under Brown.
