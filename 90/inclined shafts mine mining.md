Shaft mining is a form of underground mining where shafts are pushed vertically from top to bottom to excavate the ores and minerals. It is also called shaft sinking. It is best suited for concentrated minerals such as iron, coal, etc. which can be found at the depth of the earth's surface. It is found mostly all over the world.

Drifts/Inclined Shafts. The angle at which a drift becomes an inclined shaft is somewhat subjective, but there is some agreement that anything above 30 o to the horizontal is a shaft, not a drift.. A major advantage of drift or inclined shaft access versus vertical shaft access is the ability to move large volumes of equipment, materials and personnel in a properly designed and equipped drift
