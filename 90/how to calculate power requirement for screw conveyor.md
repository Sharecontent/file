We use a modified version of the Conveyor Equipment Manufacturers Association guidelines. The primary equation for Effective Tension, Te, is as follows: Te = LKt (Kx + KyWb + 0.015Wb) + Wm (LKy + H) + Tp + Tam + Tac. The Rulmeca Power Calculation Program will enable you to: Calculate Belt Conveyor Power Requirements.

A 16-inch diameter screw conveyor will convey 2,496 cubic feet per hour at the maximum recommended speed of 80-rpm. The actual screw conveyor speed is calculated by dividing the Selection Capacity by the capacity at 1-rpm. 1,873/31.2 = 60-rpm. 60-rpm is the correct speed for a 16-inch diameter screw conveyor with cut and folded flights and

## Torque Capacities for screw conveyors
Note: High starting torque motors must not be used without design verification by Kase's Engineering Department. Example: A 12-inch carbon steel conveyor has been selected with a required shaft horsepower of 8.9 and a speed of 64 RPM. The drive to be used has an efficiency of 85%, thus requiring a drive input of 10.46 horsepower. Therefore, a 15 horsepower motor must be used.

## Screw Conveyor Horsepower | Engineering Guide - KWS Manufacturing
Horsepower is defined as the power required to safely and feasibly convey a bulk material a fixed distance in a screw conveyor. The horsepower required to drive a screw conveyor is called Total Shaft Horsepower, or TSHP. TSHP is a function of the characteristics of the bulk material being conveyed and the friction inherent in the screw conveyor
