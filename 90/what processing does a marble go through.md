White marble will often contain small deposits of iron. If the marble becomes wet long enough to allow moisture to leach through the marble, the iron deposits will oxidize creating yellow/orange/brown stains. Usually it this process occurs over a longer period, but if enough moisture it could happen quickly and these tiles are thin.

Marble is a rock made of calcium carbonate which has been exposed to a natural recrystallization process.. Marble is being created by the transformation of other stones through the action of high temperatures and intense pressures. As a result of this process new minerals, textures, and structures give rise to a large number of different types of marble, as we will see in the examples below.

Mining marble blocks from the wall of the quarry starts with a "bench wall.". The bench wall is a large section of marble along a vertical wall that is cut with diamond cables, drills, and torches. Dynamite loosens the bench wall from the side of the quarry, and the separated wall can then be processed and cut into individual, uniform blocks.
