## Beneficiation of Iron Ores - IspatGuru
Beneficiation of Iron Ores. Iron ore is a mineral which is used after extraction and processing for the production of iron and steel. The main ores of iron usually contain Fe2O3 (70 % iron, hematite) or Fe3O4 (72 % iron. magnetite). Ores are normally associated with unwanted gangue material. Grade of iron ore is usually determined by the total

## Beneficiation Process of Magnetite - Xinhai - Xinhai Mining
Here will introduce you an efficient magnetite beneficiation process. The beneficiation process of magnetite includes four parts: crushing and screening of raw ore, stage grinding and classification, triple magnetic separation and dehydration and filtration. In the following, we will focus on these four parts to describe the beneficiation

Magnetic Separation is one of the physical concentration processes that utilizes the differences in magnetic properties of various minerals present in the ore body. The magnetic fraction may be valuable or gangue depending upon its end use in a particular process and so also the non-magnetic fraction, e.g., separation of magnetite (magnetic) from quartz (non-magnetic), separation of tin

## Magnetite beneficiation process
Separation process of strong magnetic iron ore. It is mainly used to select low-grade magnetite. Because the ore has strong magnetic properties and is easy to grind, the current stage grinding is often used for coarse-grained magnetite, while the multi-stage grinding process is used on the contrary. Grinding technology can increase the
