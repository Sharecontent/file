Conclusion From the experiment, we get 6.02% where it still not exceeding JKR's standard, <30%. So we can conclude that the aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. The aggregate are mild tough to have the resistance pressure under traffic wheel loads such as car, lorry, motorcycle and etc.

## Aggregate Impact Value Test as per IS 2386 (Part-IV) 1993
9. Remove the crushed aggregates from the cup and sieve it through 2.36 mm IS sieve until no further significant amount passes in one minute. Weigh the fraction passing the sieve (W2) to an accuracy of 1 gram. Compute the aggregate impact value. The mean of 2 observations, rounded to nearest whole number is reported as the aggregate impact value.
