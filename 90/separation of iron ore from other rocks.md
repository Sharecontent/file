## Ore Sorters and Analyzers: The Technology Develops | E & MJ
Separation was achieved by air-blasts once the rocks fell from the end of the belt. The first industrial-scale machines, installed at the Doornfontein mine in 1972, each achieved typical throughputs ranging from 50 metric tons per hour (mt/h) for 30-60 mm feed to 200 mt/h for 70-150 mm material.
