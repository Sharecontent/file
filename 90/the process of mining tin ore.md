The density of tin ore is larger than the paragenetic mineral, so the mining process of tin ore apply gravity separation. However, all kinds of Iron oxides exist in those ore, like magnetite, hematite, etc., which cannot be well separated by using gravity or flotation separation. Herein, magnetic separation and flotation separation will be used.

## The Mining Industry in Nigeria: How to Export Tin Ores - Wigmore 
There are two ways tin ore can be mined: by hand or machine. Tin ore mined by hand is labor intensive and has a lower yield than machine mining. The mining process starts by drilling boreholes into the ground to extract the tin ore, followed by blasting the tin ore with dynamite. Tin ore mined by machine is more efficient and has a higher yield

## How Is Ore Mined? - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from rock by heap leaching flotation or smelting. How ore minerals are extracted? The mining process involves the excavation of large amounts of waste rock to remove the desired mineral ore. The ore is then crushed into finely ground tailings for chemical processing and separation to extract the target minerals. .

## Tin mining
Tin mining began early in the Bronze Age, as bronze is a copper-tin alloy. Tin is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, with approximately 2 ppm (parts per million), compared to iron with 50,000 ppm.  As tin ore pits become deeper, the number of lethal cave-ins has risen. Approximately one tin miner a week was killed in Indonesia
