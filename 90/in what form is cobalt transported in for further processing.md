## Processing of Spent Li-Ion Batteries for Recovery of Cobalt and Lithium 
The short lifespan and ever-growing demand for lithium-ion batteries, containing cobalt and lithium, are the key factors for their recycling. In this study, spent laptop batteries were discharged, crushed in an attritor mill and sieved. The active material consists of LiCoO2 and graphite at around 59% and 41%, respectively. The active mass was reduced in a microwave and muffle furnace at

## WOA1 - Cobalt removal for chamber clean or pre-clean process 
Implementations described herein generally relate to methods and apparatus for in-situ removal of unwanted deposition buildup from one or more interior surfaces of a semiconductor substrate processing chamber. In one implementation, a method for removing cobalt or cobalt containing deposits from one or more interior surfaces of a substrate processing chamber after processing a substrate

## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing Copper Ores
This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores, in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation, 2) thickening, 3) smelting, and 4) electrolysis. Following mining, transporting, and crushing to a consistent gravel or golf ball-size, the crushed ore is further processed at a mill
