## Coal stove conversionuft360
If your coal stove has grates, it can burn wood. What eliminates a coal stove from burning wood is a hopper that allows the coal to slide down into the firebox as the coal before it is consumed. Pellet stoves you "set & forget". Clean out and reset the next morning and burn all day. Firewood is expensive and makes a mess where it's stored, when you stack it in the house and when you clean out

## At what temperature does coal burn? Solid fuel, types, features 
Brown coal belongs to young deposits, therefore it contains the greatest amount of moisture (from 20% to 40%), volatile substances (up to 50%) and a small amount of carbon (from 50% to 70%). Its combustion temperature is higher than that of wood, and is 350 ° C. Calorific value - 3500 kcal / kg. The most common type of fuel is bituminous coal.
