## How The Process Of Silica Sand Mining - LZZG
The alkali in the concrete chemically reacts with the aggregate whose chemical composition is active silica. After the alkali-silicic acid gel is formed, it absorbs water and expands, and the expansion stress causes the concrete to crack. This process is called the alkali-aggregate reaction.

## Silica Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
To make calcium silicate bricks, silica sand is mixed with high calcium lime at a sand-lime ratio of 10 or 20. The mix is then compressed into moulds and "autoclaved" at about 170°C (340°F) for several hours. Some gel, similar to the calcium silicate hydrate gel of the type that is formed by cement, is formed, and this bonds the sand particles together.

Jul 17, 2021Silica sand mining production process. 1. Mineral processing: sorting and sorting the ore. 2. Washing: Washing is subject to no obvious impurities observed by naked eyes. 3. Calcining: set the furnace temperature to 860 degrees Celsius, and the redness of the stone shall prevail when the material is discharged.

Silica sand washing process. Washing and graded. The grade of SiO2 in quartz sand decreases with the finer grain size of quartz sand, and the grade of impurity minerals is the opposite. This phenomenon is especially obvious in quartz sand containing a large number of clay minerals. Therefore, the quartz sand ore before the selection is carried out.

Description. Also called silica sand or quartz sand, silica is made of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ). Silicon compounds are the most significant component of the Earth's crust. Since sand is plentiful, easy to mine and relatively easy to process, it is the primary ore source of silicon. The metamorphic rock, quartzite, is another source.
