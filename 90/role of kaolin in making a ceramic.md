## Different Types Of Clay Used In Making Ceramics
The poor plasticity of kaolin is chiefly due to its relatively large particle sizes. Consequently, pre-fired kaolin ceramics can easily tear when bent, if in a moist unfired state (i.e. moisture levels are suboptimal). Of all classes of clay, kaolin has the highest temperature maturity levels (high-fire clay) with temperatures as high as 1,800 °C.

Porcelain ceramics are made by heating materials, generally kaolin clay, in a kiln to temperatures between 2,200 and 2,600 degrees Fahrenheit. Porcelain is a very heat-resistant and strong material compared to other types of ceramics. This is because of the vitrification process and formation of the silicate mineral mullite when fired.
