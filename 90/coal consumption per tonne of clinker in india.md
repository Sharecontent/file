Clinkers are a problem when they form in coal-fired boilers. Coal-fired boilers were once commonly used in American homes in the days before electricity. Coal burns hotter and longer than wood, but coal, like wood, can produce leftover chunks called clinkers. To make the boiler run more efficiently, the clinkers must be removed.
