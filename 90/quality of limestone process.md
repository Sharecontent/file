## Limestone quality | Lhoist - Minerals and lime producer
The quality of limestone found in any deposit depends on how it evolved over time and its surrounding environment. This influences the amount of non-carbonate minerals (impurities like clay, quartz sand, etc.) in the sediment. When limestone reaches the Earth's surface, it may comprise impurities transported by infiltrated rainwater.
