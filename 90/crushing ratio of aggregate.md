## Why it pays off to invest in multi-stage crushing process
If the ratio of feed material and end product size is 16:1, you need 2 crushers, and this is calculated by multiplying 4 with 4. If the ratio would be, let's say 20:1, you would need 3 crushers. Some easily crushable rock types can be crushed in two stages and some harder rock types in turn require to be processed in three stages or more.

3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Crushed Aggregate's Effects on Slumps of Concrete. The Figure 1 depicts slum value of A-1 coarse aggregates for all five groups. For Impact Crushed (A-1) coarse aggregates slump values were evaluated for all five groups and it was evident from experiment that, there was a steady decrease in slump value with the decrease of w/c ratio.

The coarse aggregates obtained by different crushing mechanisms (jaw and impact crushers) show very similar characteristics in terms of binder content assessed by acid leaching (27.5 and 26.6 wt.%), water absorption (8.76 and 9.75 wt.%) and porosity (18.6 and 20.2 vol.%).Thus, it is not possible to conclude that any of these mechanisms are more efficient in removing the cement paste attached

## Effect of crushing mechanism on the shape properties of coarse aggregates
Jan 1, 2022Aggregate crushing generally takes place at different stages such as primary, secondary and tertiary to obtain the desired shape characteristics and quality of aggregates.  Fig. 9 shows the variation of mean aspect ratio of aggregates crushed from J-C and J-J crushers. Aspect ratio is a measure of flat and elongation of aggregate particles

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Classification Of Aggregates Based On Size, Shape & Source - Civil Planets
The crushing of disintegrated rocks manufactures Coarse Aggregates. 2:  If we use the elongated aggregates in concrete, the voids ratio will become high compared to the other aggregates. Flaky aggregates - The flaky aggregates are having a very light thickness, and it can easily crack. Due to its lower workability, it is not used in
