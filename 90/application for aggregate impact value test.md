## What is the use of impact test of aggregate? - Heimduo
What are the applications of aggregate crushing value test?  The apparatus of the aggregate impact value test consists of: A testing machine weighing 45 to 60 kg and having a metal base with a plane lower surface of not less than 30 cm in diameter. Level and plane concrete floor of minimum 45 cm thickness are used to support it.

## Aggregate Impact Value Test-10+ Important Notes to Remember
Aggregate impact value test gives an indication of aggregate's toughness property (i.e. property of a material to resist impact) Aggregate impact values are used to classify the stone aggregates with respect to toughness property as given below. Aggregate impact value (%) Toughness Properties <10 Exceptionally tough / Strong 10 - 20 Very tough / Strong [.]
