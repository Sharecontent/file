Crude ore, or ore mined in the natural state, seldom occurs in a pure state and requires some form of beneficiation. Crude ore is commonly mixed with other minerals (gangue), which reduce the iron content.

This latter froth product was re-ground, in a ball mill, to -200 mesh, and re-passed over a magnetic separator, yielding (a) a tailing and (b) a second magnetic concentrate containing 66.45% Fe and 5.38% silica.
