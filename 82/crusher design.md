A crusher's wear parts need to last as long as operationally-economically possible. Typical numbers are for liner and mantles to have a useful wear-life of almost 2,000,000 tonne on abrasive taconite and 9,000,000 tonnes on porphyry copper ores. Dependability and long service life are landmarks of good primary crusher design of up to 30 yrs.

## Crusher design : robotwars - reddit
Why are crushers designed like the one on the left (Razer style)? A shorter claw means more force retained from whatever the ram is rated at. If a really big claw can go right through the armor then it can do loads of internal damage and lead to a KO, but modern armor is too good for Razer's style of claw to work anymore.
