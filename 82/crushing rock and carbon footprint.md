## 5 Things That Have A Major Impact On Your Carbon Footprint
Here are five of the most critical factors impacting your carbon footprint: 1. Where You Live. Where you lay your head can have a huge effect on how much carbon you spew into the atmosphere. In general, living in the U.S. isn't great for the planet, but some places in America are more climate-friendly than others.

## The carbon footprint of hospital diagnostic imaging in Australia
Clinicians and administrators can reduce carbon emissions from diagnostic imaging, firstly by reducing the ordering of unnecessary imaging, or by ordering low-impact imaging (X-ray and US) in place of high-impact MRI and CT when clinically appropriate to do so. Secondly, whenever possible, scanners should be turned off to reduce emissions from standby power. Thirdly, ensuring high utilisation

Food's carbon footprint is the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food you eat.

## What is a carbon footprint? - Conservation International
A carbon footprint is a simple way to express that impact. The "size" of your carbon footprint depends on multiple factors. The primary one is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere by a given activity. People, products and entire industries have carbon footprints. Your personal footprint includes emissions from

This layer should only be the very top of your driveway and form the surface, so laying a depth of 50mm should be more than substantial. At this depth, the gravel should fully hide the subbase layer but channels won't form when you drive on the surface. Lay the gravel by emptying the bags around the driveway, evenly spaced apart. Ideally, you will choose a size of gravel that is around 20mm.
