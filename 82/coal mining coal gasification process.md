## Coal Gasification » MYUPSC - GRASP IAS
Sep 14, 2020The process involves pumping oxygen and steam through a small borehole into the coal seam to produce a small and controlled combustion. Unlike coal-bed methane, therefore, the actual coal is converted from a solid state into gas. The hydrogen, methane, carbon monoxide and CO2 are then siphoned off through a second borehole.

## Coal Gasification - NextIAS
About Coal gasification. It is a process in which coal is partially oxidised with air, oxygen, steam or carbon dioxide to form a fuel gas. This gas is then used instead of piped natural gas, methane and others for deriving energy. India has a reserve of 307 Billion tonnes of thermal coal and about 80% of coal produced is used in thermal power

coal gasification, any process of converting coal into gas for use in illuminating and heating. The first illuminating gas was manufactured from coal in England in the late 18th century by the process of carbonization or destructive distillation, heating coal in the absence of air, leaving a residue of coke as a by-product. Such coal gas was widely used for street lighting and home

The process works by injecting an oxidant (usually air, oxygen, or steam) into a coal seam. The oxidant reacts with the coal and water present in the seam to produce syngas that is extracted through a production well. Coal resources that are deeper than 60 meters and not suitable for conventional mining are ideally suited for UCG 3.

## Coal - Environment | September 2022
Coal Coal. Coal (IMPACT: /ˈkəʊl/) is a fossil fuel extracted from the ground by underground mining or open-pit mining ( surface mining). It is a readily combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock. It is composed primarily of carbon along with assorted other elements, including sulfur.Often associated with the Industrial Revolution, coal remains an enormously important fuel.

## Underground coal gasification - Global Energy Monitor
Underground coal gasification (UCG) is a gasification process used to produce gas from coal in situ by injecting air or oxygen into non-mined coal seams and extracting the product gas via surface wells. The resulting synthetic gas ("syngas") can be used to produce electricity, as well as chemicals, liquid fuels, hydrogen and synthetic natural gas.

## Underground Coal Gasification (UCG)
Underground Coal Gasification ( UCG ) involves igniting coal in the ground, then collecting and using the gases that result from its partial combustion. Although the idea dates back over a century, very few UCG plants have ever been built. Underground gasification could potentially allow the use of coal that is currently uneconomical to mine.
