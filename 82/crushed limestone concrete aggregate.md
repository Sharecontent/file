Limestone vs. Crushed Concrete. In its pure form, limestone differs significantly from crushed concrete in that the former constitutes a naturally formed rock found in marine environments and the other a manmade construction material. Limestone may appear in crushed concrete as a material found in the cement used to mix concrete.

Limestone has a lot of uses in various industries. We cut limestones into bricks, paver, or tiles in the construction industry or pulverize them for cement production. We can also crush limestones and use them as aggregates to mix with cement and sand for different concrete and mortar mixes. Other industries also use limestone, such as manufacturing paper, glass, and even paint.

Because limestone aggregate is normally comprised of 100% crushed fragments, the better surface texture and higher angularity that obtains lead to good bond with the cement and good particle interlock, both of which help in achieving good compressive strength properties.  Structures Built with Limestone Aggregate Concrete.

## Crushed gravel size chartawech
Because large stones and quarries are hard on tires and require heavy metal, crushed stone was hard to make and transport until heavy machinery with tracks was developed. WW2 expedited the development of this machinery, and crushed stone began to be widely used in construction projects in the 1940s and 1950s.
