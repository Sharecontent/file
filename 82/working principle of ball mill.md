## What Are the Differences between Ball Mill and Rod Mill?
1. Ball mill. a Ball mill has a wide range of applications. It can grind metal ore and non-metal ores, which is suitable for hard materials, such as quartz, gold ore, copper ore, iron ore, potash feldspar, etc. b Ball mill is also can be applied in the industries such as cement, construction materials, fireproofing materials, glass, and ceramics.

## working principle of ball mills
Ball Mill Working Principle. Grinding is usually performed wet, although in certain applications dry grinding is used. When the mill is rotated, the mixture of medium, ore, and water, known as the mill charge, is intimately mixed; the medium comminuting the particles depends on the speed of rotation of the mill and the shell liner structure.
