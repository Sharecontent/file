In addition, Buena Vista also provides a very favourable ore characteristic given its intrusive origin. In this regard, the magnetite at Buena Vista is much coarser grained, and softer, than typical banded iron (BIF) hosted magnetite deposits and consequently much more easily liberated during the beneficiation process.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
MINING AND PROCESSING: Iron ore mining can be broadly divided into two categories namely 1) manual mining which is employed in small mines and 2) mechanized mining is suitable for large iron ore mines. Manual mining method is normally limited to float ores and small mines. Mining of reef ore is also being done manually on a small scale.
