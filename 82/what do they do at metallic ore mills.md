## When smelting iron ore?f
Score: 4.4/5 (12 votes) . Smelting involves heating up ore until the metal becomes spongy and the chemical compounds in the ore begin to break down.Most important, it releases oxygen from the iron ore, which makes up a high percentage of common iron ores. The most primitive facility used to smelt iron is a bloomery.

## Manganese: Nodules, Uses, Facts, Ore, Alloys, Metal - Geology
Manganese removes oxygen and sulfur when iron ore (an iron and oxygen compound) is converted into iron. It also is an essential alloy that helps convert iron into steel. As an alloy, it decreases the brittleness of steel and imparts strength. The amount of manganese used per ton of steel is rather small, ranging from 6 to 9 kilograms.
