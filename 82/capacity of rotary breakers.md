## Circuit Breaker Making Capacity - Inst Tools
For determining the making current of the circuit breaker we must multiply symmetrical breaking current by (2) 1/2 to convert to peak value from rms value. and then by 1.8 to take into account the doubling effect of maximum asymmetry. Rated Making Current = 1.8 x (2)1/2 rated short circuit breaking current.

## Rotary Hammers, Demolition Hammers & Breaker Hammers
Rotary, demolition, and breaker hammers generate greater hammering force than hammer drills. Rotary hammers drill and chisel concrete and masonry, creating holes and delivering high-impact, low-frequency blows. Also known as SDS drills and combination hammers, they have a hammer-and-rotate mode that spins and thrusts the bit to drill larger-diameter holes in harder materials than hammer drills.
