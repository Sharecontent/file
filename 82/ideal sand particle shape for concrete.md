## Which Sand Do I Need? - SoilWorx
Concrete Sand. Concrete sand is a naturally occurring material with a nominal size of generally less than 5mm. Typically washed and screened during the production process, the sand has a larger particle size with aggregrates through it which means it significantly improve drainage and soil structure when mixed through heavy soils.

In concrete or mortar, the aggregate is a granular material, it is called fine aggregate when the particles of granular material are so fine that they can pass through a 4.75mm sieve. To increase the volume of concrete it is used in the construction industry and is cost-saving material. It consists of crushed stone and sand and quality

Concrete is a mixture of a paste (formed from cement and water) and rocks (smaller aggregates). Cement and water are combined to form a paste that is then mixed with aggregates and coats each stone and sand particle. Through a process called hydration, the cement and water harden and bind the smaller aggregates into a rock-like mass.

## Building Materials: Particle Size & Particle Shape Analysis
Based on the principle of Dynamic Image Analysis (ISO ), the CAMSIZER X2 provides precise particle size and shape information of powders, granules and suspensions in a measuring range from 0.8 Œºm to 8 mm. The CAMSIZER X2 produces a particle flow which is characterized by an optical system with high resolution.
