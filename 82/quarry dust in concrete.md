## How to Control Dust in Quarries | Quarrying & Aggregates
In order to prevent dust accumulation in the pipe and facilitate cleaning, the air pipe should be laid as far as possible vertically or inclined (inclination angle â¥45Â°). Under special circumstances, it must be laid horizontally. The horizontal pipe should have sufficient airflow speed (16-20m/s) to prevent Dust is deposited in the tube.

How Far Does Quarry Dust Travel? Research has shown that large dust particles (larger than 30Âµm) will be dispersed within 100m of the source. Intermediate sized particles (10-30Âµm) are likely to travel m.However smaller particles (less than 10Âµm) can travel much further from the source.

##  Partial Replacement of Sand by Quarry Dust in Concrete - IJSRP
investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties.
