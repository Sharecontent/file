In general, the limestone in lime kiln will go through three stages: preheating, calcining and cooling. In the preheating stage, the feed limestone is pre-calcined using the heat air from kiln so that it can thoroughly burnt down. While in the calcining stage, the fuel is introduced into the lime kiln to calcine the preheated limestone.
