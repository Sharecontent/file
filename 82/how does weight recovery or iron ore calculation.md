## calculating mining recovery
Dilution and ore recovery - Know More. The issue of balancing dilution and ore recovery is a challenging one as profitability is to be optimized while not effecting the efficiency of operation It has been noted that instead of utilizing labour intensive mining methods to high tonnage bulk mining has decreased the ability to control ore recovery

##  Maximizing the recovery of fine iron ore - SciELO
Maximizing the recovery of fine iron ore using magnetic separation Most iron ore operations that require beneficiation of ROM ore to produce lump, fine (sinter), and pelletizing concentrate iron ore products will discard a slimes fraction to final tailings. This fraction can vary in particle size from -200 µm down to -10 µm.
