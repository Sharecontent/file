## Ore Minerals : What are Ore Minerals? - Geology Page
Ore Minerals. An ore is a natural occurrence of rock or sediment which contains enough minerals with economically important elements, typically metals, that can be extracted from the deposit economically. The ores are extracted by mining for a profit from the earth; they are then refined (often by smelting) in order to extract the valuable

## Kinds Of Metallic Ore Deposits
The formation of many metallic and non-metallic ore deposits is a result of coupling of mineralization, related to anoxic environment and regional, or global background. Inter act~on, concordance and continual development of the mineralization and environmental background control the large to superlarge scale of ore deposits.

## Hydrothermal mineral deposit
Hydrothermal mineral deposits are accumulations of valuable minerals which formed from hot waters circulating in Earth's crust through fractures. They eventually create metallic-rich fluids concentrated in a selected volume of rock, which become supersaturated and then precipitate ore minerals. In some occurrences, minerals can be extracted for a profit by mining.

Ore minerals, including the incompatible elements, remain dissolved in the hot solution, then crystallize out when the solution cools. Deposits created by means of these hot solutions are called hydrothermal deposits. Some of the world's most significant deposits of gold, silver, lead, mercury, zinc, and tungsten started out this way.

## Mineral Ore Deposits: Meaning, Origin and Types | Geology - Geography Notes
Introduction to Ore Deposits: Minerals form chief source of all the industrial metals and non-metals. The commonly used metals like aluminum, copper, iron, lead, zinc etc. are all manufactured using minerals as raw materials. Similarly non-metals like glass and refractories are also made from minerals. Minerals are also source of energy.

The basic extraction of ore deposits follows these steps: Prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent and value of ore where it is located ("ore body"). Conduct resource estimation to mathematically estimate the size and grade of the deposit. Conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore

The best metal ore minerals are those that contain large amounts of metals of value. Most metallic ore minerals are native elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides, or hydroxides. Ore deposits are highly variable in nature and origin. The most important kinds of ore deposits are magmatic, hydrothermal, or sedimentary. 9.1 Mineral Commodities
