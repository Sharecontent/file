## To Determine Aggregate Impact value of Aggregate - Concrete Practical
Aggregate is a granular material obtained by processing natural materials. BS882 splits aggregate into coarse and fine elements, coarse being described as gravel or crushed rock and fine being described as sand.Aggregate consists of particles of a rock, of a controlled particle size distribution, used in the construction of a building or civil

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Aggregate Crushing Value Test - The Constructor
Aggregate crushing value = (W2 x 100) / (W1-W) W2 =Weight of fraction passing through the appropriate sieve W1-W =Weight of surface dry sample. The mean of two result to nearest whole number is the aggregate crushing value. Result The aggregate crushing value of the given sample= Aggregate Crushing Values for Roads and Pavement Construction

##  Impact Value of Aggregate
The aggregate impact value gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to sudden shock or impact, which in some aggregates differs from its resistance to a slow compressive load. 2.Apparatus Required Fig. 1: Balance Balance should be accurate upto 1 g Fig. 2: Sieves Seives required are 12.5, 10.0 and 2.36 mm Fig. 3: Impact
