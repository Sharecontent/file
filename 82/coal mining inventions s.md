## Coal mining and transportation - U.S. Energy Information Administration 
Mining coal . Coal miners use large machines to remove coal from the earth. Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Industries of Scotland - Coal Mining
The Collier Laddie sung by Alan Reid. Coal mining began in Scotland as early as the 12th century. The development of the steam engine by James Watt in the 18th century began to increase demand for coal. Railway development in the 19th century increased demand for coal further and mines therefore had to be dug deeper.
