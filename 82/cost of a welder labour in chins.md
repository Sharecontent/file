## Is Welding Expensive? (Breaking Down the Costs)
Labor Costs. In many ways, welding is more than just a functional method of joining metal. It can really be considered an art form, which is why, when it comes to hiring a professional, the most expensive factor is labor costs. For most projects, labor costs make up to 60 to 70 percent of the total price, but can even extend to 85 percent.

## Welding Cost Calculation And Estimation - Material Welding
The following equations help to calculate this cost: Arc kilowatts = (Welding amps x arc voltage)/ 1,000. Input kilowatt = (Arc kilowatts)/ (% efficiency at arc voltage) Power cost per hour = Input kilowatts x rate for kwh. Power cost/meter = Power cost per hour/ meter length of weld deposited in one arc hour.
