## Economiser in Thermal Power Plant | Economiser | Electrical4U
Hence, the economiser in thermal power plants, is used to economise the process of electrical power generation, as the name of the device is suggestive of.The recovered heat is in turn used to preheat the boiler feed water, that will eventually be converted to super-heated steam.Thus, saving on fuel consumption and economising the process to a large extent, as we are essentially gathering the

## Thermal Power Plants: Components & Working Principle
Working Principle of a Thermal Plant. The working fluid is water and steam. This is called feed water and steam cycle. The ideal Thermodynamic Cycle to which the operation of a Thermal Power Station closely resembles is the RANKINE CYCLE.. In a steam boiler, the water is heated up by burning the fuel in the air in the furnace, and the function of the boiler is to give dry superheated steam at

## Thermal Power Plant - Basic, Definition, Parts, Working Principle
A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.

## Water for thermal power plants: Understanding a piece of the water 
Thermal power plants generate around 80 per cent of the electricity produced in the world 3, by converting heat into power in the form of electricity. Most of them heat water to transform it into steam, which spins the turbines that produce electricity. After passing through the turbine, the steam is cooled down and condensed to start the cycle

## What Is a Thermal Power Plant? Operation and Types
A thermal power plant is an electric plant that converts thermal energy into electrical energy. The difference between one type of plant and another is the way the heat is obtained. The heat sources of a thermal power plant are: Fossil fuels ( coal, diesel and natural gas) Nuclear reactions of uranium atoms. Biomass.

## Notes on Steam Power Plant | Basic Of Thermal Power Plant
Disadvantages (demerits) of thermal power plant. 1. The fuel (coal or oil) used in thermal power plant will one day get exhausted since it is a non renewable source of energy that is used. 2. It cannot be used as peak load plant, as its part load efficiency decreases very rapidly with decreasing load. 3.
