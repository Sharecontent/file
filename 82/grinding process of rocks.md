Grinding Process Of Rocks. rock particles carried by wind water and ice can wear away rocks in the process called the wearing of rock by a grinding action ice wedging water expands when it freezes and acts as a wedge is called chemical weathering produces rock particles that hve a different mineral makeup from the original rock.

## Enhanced Weathering: crushed rocks spread on farmland can capture 
Recent research demonstrates that humans can speed up the process substantially to help fight modern global warming. Accelerated weathering. The biggest limit on weathering is the amount of silicate minerals exposed at any given time. Grinding up volcanic silicate rocks into a fine powder increases the surface area available for reactions.

## What Is The Grinding Away Of Rock By Rock Particles?
What kind of weathering is grinding of rocks? Rocks break down into smaller pieces through weathering. Rocks and sediment grinding against each other wear away surfaces. This type of weathering is called abrasion and it happens as wind and water rush over rocks. The rocks become smoother as rough and jagged edges break off.
