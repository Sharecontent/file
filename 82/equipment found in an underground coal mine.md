The coal mines of Britain played a significant role in the development of industry, but now with so many abandoned and all set to be closed by October 2024, the U.K. is looking into alternative. It merged with the mine Bobrek in 1997. In 1999, it went through some more changes and the Mining Plant Bytom II was created. After 2005, the mine was closed with most of it being destroyed or demolished.

## Appendix F: Underground Coal Mining Methods and Engineering Dust 
When the 1969 Coal Mine Health and Safety Act was enacted, U.S. coal production was about 600 million tons with about 60 percent underground mining and 40 percent surface mining. Longwall mining accounted for less than 1 percent of the underground production; room-and-pillar continuous mining accounted for about 50 percent of the underground

## coal mining - Underground mining | Britannica
In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata. Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface, and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities for such essential activities as human and
