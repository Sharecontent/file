## Lime Kilns | Solo Resources
The TSR-Kilns series utilizes the regenerative process for lime calcination. There are two distinguishing characteristics for the TSR-Kilns: the parallel flow of hot gases and stone in the burning zone, which allows a mild burning of the limestone without over-burning, and. the regenerative preheating of all combustion air, using the limestone

Several different types of kilns are used for the calcination process. These kilns can be rotary kilns or shaft kilns. The type of the kiln to be selected strongly depend on the characteristics of the limestone, anticipated production rate, cost of fuel, investment costs, available fuel, local conditions, infrastructure and other things.

## What is burnt in a limestone kiln to provide the heat?
What type of reaction is heating limestone? When limestone is heated in a kiln, the calcium carbonate breaks down into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. This type of reaction is called thermal decomposition. The process is called calcining. Once burnt limestone turns into calcium oxide which is known as quicklime.

## A Review of The Dolomite and Limestone Industry in South Africa
Limestone is converted to quicklime through calcining in rotary or vertical kilns. In the lime process, for every ton of saleable quicklime produced, about 2 tons of 'pure' limestone or up to 6 tons of impure limestone is consumed. Limestone consumption depends on the type of product, limestone purity,
