## THE DURABILITY AND HARDNESS OF METALS - Jewelry Secrets
The Moh's Scale of Hardness. The Moh's Scale of Hardness ranks minerals, materials, metals and Gemstones on a scale of 1-10. 10 being the best and the most durable.. Diamond is a 10. Gold and Silver on the other hand are only a 2.5 - 3 on the Moh's Scale. They are fairly easy to work with (Jewelers love it) because they are so malleable.

The higher the score, the harder the metal. Vickers hardness of 9ct gold is between 80 to 120 (depending on the other constituents of the alloy and the condition of the material). 18ct gold receives a score of between 135 to 165.

Your first task is to identify the mineralogy and textural properties like grain sorting and angularity. Some of the problems associated with the determination of provenance are nicely illustrated using quartz arenites as an example. Quartz arenites contain 95% and more detrital quartz grains. They tend to be well sorted; grains are well rounded.
