## Ball Mill Parameter Selection & Calculation - JXSC
1 Calculation of ball mill capacity. The production capacity of the ball mill is determined by the amount of material required to be ground, and it must have a certain margin when designing and selecting. There are many factors affecting the production capacity of the ball mill, in addition to the nature of the material (grain size, hardness, density, temperature and humidity), the degree of

## Area Calculator
A sector of a circle is essentially a proportion of the circle that is enclosed by two radii and an arc. Given a radius and an angle, the area of a sector can be calculated by multiplying the area of the entire circle by a ratio of the known angle to 360° or 2π radians, as shown in the following equation: area =. θ. 360.

## Calculation of Grinding Balls Surface Area and Volume
S=4πR 2, where: S - the surface area of the ball; π - PIconstant, a mathematical constant that is equal to the ratio of the circle's circumference to its diameter. 3.14 isa commonly used value for PI; R- the radius of the ball. The volume of a grinding ball is determined by the formula: V=4/3πR 3, where: V- the volume of the ball.
