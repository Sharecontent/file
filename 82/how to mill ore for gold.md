## Gold mining
Gold mining is the extraction of gold resources by mining.Historically, mining gold from alluvial deposits used manual separation processes, such as gold panning.However, with the expansion of gold mining to ores that are not on the surface, has led to more complex extraction processes such as pit mining and gold cyanidation.In the 20th and 21st centuries, most volume of mining was done by

## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

Gold miners are facing a reserves crisis, and what is left in the ground is becoming more and more challenging to process.Refractory gold reserves, which require more sophisticated treatment methods in order to achieve oxide-ore recovery rates, correspond to 24 percent of current gold reserves and 22 percent of gold resources worldwide (Exhibit 1).

The percolation cyanidation method is also one of the cyanide leaching processes. Its principle is that the cyanide solution penetrates through the ore layer to leach the gold from the gold-bearing ore. It is suitable for alluvial and loose porous materials. There are two kinds of percolation cyanidation methods: pool leaching and heap leaching.

Ore processing is a 24 hour operation. Ore is stockpiled at the processing plant, and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader. The ore is conveyed, and lime is added to raise its pH. Following crushing through a jaw crusher, the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding (SAG) mill along with water and steel balls.
