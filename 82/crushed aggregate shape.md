## What is the difference between crushed and uncrushed aggregates?
What is the difference between crushed gravel and crushed stone? Shapes. Due to the crushing process, crushed stone typically has more angular surfaces. Gravel tends to have a rounder shape due to the natural weathering process, and is usually much smaller than crushed stone. However, gravel that is crushed will have a more angular shape.

## Classification of Aggregates: Grain Size, Density, Shape, Origin
Classification of aggregates based on: Grain Size. If you separate aggregates by size, there are two overriding categories: The size of fine aggregates is defined as 4.75mm or smaller. That is, aggregates which can be passed through a number 4 sieve, with a mesh size of 4.75mm. Fine aggregates include things such as sand, silt and clay.

## Aggregate - Pavement Interactive
Aggregate " is a collective term for the mineral materials such as sand, gravel and crushed stone that are used with a binding medium (such as water, bitumen, portland cement, lime, etc.) to form compound materials (such as asphalt concrete and portland cement concrete). By volume, aggregate generally accounts for 92 to 96 percent of HMA and about 70 to 80 percent of portland cement concrete.
