## Extraction of Metals: Methods, Processes Involved, Minerals, and Ores
The processes used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed. 1. Extracting Metals Low in the Reactivity Series. Metals low in the activity series are very unreactive.
