The ore is to be upgraded to about 65% Fe, in connection with a new trade agreement being negotiated for export of iron ore to Japan. The ore after crushing to -3" size was attrition ground and washed in a concrete mixer. But there was not much improvement in the grade of the coarse fraction, because of the small clay content in the ore.

## What is iron ore beneficiation? - Shandong Jiugang Tisco Steel Co., Ltd.
Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.
