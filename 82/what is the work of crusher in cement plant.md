Whether you hand mix concrete in a plastic tub, homemade mixing tub or wheelbarrow, the technique is the same to find the right concrete mix ratio. However, it's easier to move and dump concrete that's mixed in a wheelbarrow. For larger jobs, you could rent a mixer ($35 per day), but it may be more economical to simply order ready-mix concrete.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## What Is Cement Made Of? - Modern Design
Concrete is an end product which contains cement, stone and sand. Cement is an active ingredient of concrete that binds the sand and stone together. This is what gives concrete it's great compressive strength. Cement is actually the active ingredient used to make lots of masonry products like grout, thinset and mortar.

## Pea Graveles-lifestyle
As much as people love the crunching sound underfoot, pea gravel isn't actually suited for much else besides paths and plant life. Meaning, it's not sturdy enough to support patio furniture such as lawn chairs or tables.  Hot tar can't stick to wet pavement, so the paving contractor will schedule the work for a dry day.
