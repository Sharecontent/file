## What is M Sand? - Source, Properties & Advantages - Civil Planets
What is Manufactured Sand? The M sand is manufactured by crushing the quarry stones into required grain size & after washing, grading the crushed cubical shape with rounded edges, it turned as a construction material.  Now the aggregates are screened and if found oversized aggregates again those aggregates are involved in crushing. After 1st

This can help in reducing the sand mining from river beds. Lesser impurities and good working properties: Manufactured sand is free of silt and clay particles, and has denser particle packing than natural sand. It also offers higher flexural strength, better abrasion resistance, higher unit weight and lower permeability.
