## What is M Sand? - Source, Properties & Advantages - Civil Planets
What is Manufactured Sand? The M sand is manufactured by crushing the quarry stones into required grain size & after washing, grading the crushed cubical shape with rounded edges, it turned as a construction material.  Now the aggregates are screened and if found oversized aggregates again those aggregates are involved in crushing. After 1st
