4. Sand Hole Defect. Sand hole is a type of typical shrinkage cavity defect. You could see the empty holes after sand blasting or machining process. The sand dropped from sand molds, rolling into the liquid metal, then caused sand holes. It is the problem of sand mold, or the flow speed of the metal is too high, so could be solved by foundries.

Iron is the backbone of the world we have built around us and it is the basic ingredient of steel (iron plus carbon). Iron is a very useful metal because it can be mixed with other metals to make a whole variety of 'alloys' which are even stronger and don't rust easily and can be shaped into products from cars to pins, household appliances to buildings, bridges to railways, food cans to tools.
