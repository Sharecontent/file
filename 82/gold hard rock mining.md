## Cyanide Free Gold Leaching Alternative - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
What is cyanide and why do we need cyanide-free gold leaching process? Cyanide (CN -) has been used since 1889 to recover gold from hard rock. As sodium cyanide (NaCN), it reacts with gold, oxygen (O), and water (H 2 O) to form a gold cyanide complex (Na [Au(CN) 2] ) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The chemical reaction dubbed the "Elsner Equation", named after its discoverer, is shown below:

## How Underground Mining Works | HowStuffWorks
There are hard-rock underground mines, and there are soft-rock underground mines. Coal deposits, for instance, live in relatively soft sedimentary rock. Gold deposits live in igneous or metamorphic rock, which is relatively hard, as do diamonds, copper, silver, nickel and zinc [source: Great Mining].

## TENORM: Hard Rock Metal Mining | US EPA
There are two main categories of mining in the United States: hard rock mining and coal mining. It is called hard rock mining because the minerals are generally located in igneous and metamorphic formations. Coal, however, is typically found in sedimentary deposits.

About Hardrock Mines. These are primarily ores and metals (e.g. gold, silver, copper, lead, zinc, nickel). Most are small to medium in size, though there are a handful of large, significant sites. These sites are predominately in the West, which gave rise to the establishment of cities and towns during homesteading (Westward population expansion).

Many pyrite and pyrrhotite minerals contain gold, which is often recovered when extracting copper from lode vein deposits. The purity of gold is stated in terms of fineness and carats (ct). Fineness is defined as the parts per 1000. For example gold with a fineness of 800 means it is 80% pure gold. Alternatively, gold that is 100% pure is 24ct.
