The smaller the output size, the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers. Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials, this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear-cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).
