It consists of a mixture of hydrocarbons, and for safety reasons is processed with international specifications and standards. In commercial aviation, most jet engines use fuels known as Jet A and Jet A-1. The difference between Jet A and Jet A-1 is that Jet A freezes at 40 degrees below zero, and Jet A-1 does so at -53 degrees.

## Jet Drive
Water enters the pump cavity on the bottom of the boat. The submerged impeller spins to create thrust. Water is directed out the back of the craft through a stator vane. The stator increases the efficiency of the impeller because it removes the "twist" from the water jet created by the impeller. The stator vane focuses the energy of the thrust.

This vehicle, looking like an aircraft with wheels, used a unique combination of both jet thrust and the engine driving the wheels. Speeds of 282 km/h (175 mph) were claimed. In the 1960s, Ford and GM also were developing gas turbine semi-trucks. Ford displayed the Big Red at the 1964 World's Fair.

The reason for this is that the effectiveness of the directional control of the 'jet' (the flow of water expelled by the jet that provides thrust) is more or less proportional to the speed.

The primary flow passes into the combustion chamber, so it is a flow of warm air. The secondary flow is ejected directly from either side of the engine; it is a cold air flow that provides 80% of the thrust. At the exit, cold air mixes with warm air, causing the engine to cool down.

Jet Boats use smaller engines than traditional stern driven boat models. In most cases stern driven boats use automotive style engines which are similar to a V-6 or V-8 you might find in your car. These engines, due to their size and displacement operate at lower RPMs and therefore by nature are less noisy than the compact personal watercraft
