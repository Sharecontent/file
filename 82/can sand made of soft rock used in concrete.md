As the name implies the coarse (or concreting) sand contains less of the smaller particles than the soft sand. Coarse sand should only be used for concreting jobs and soft sand should only be used for render or mortar. Coarse aggregate generally lies between a 4mm and a 20mm sieve and is typically nearly half the weight of the concrete.

## Importance of Gravel and Sand for Concrete | Hunker
A typical concrete mix contains 60 to 80 percent sand and gravel, also known as an "aggregate." This aggregate compound is more than filler. It plays an important part in the concrete's composition. The amount of sand and gravel in a bag of concrete determines the mixture's strength and texture.

## Can You Use Building Sand For Concrete? | BagOfConcrete
You should use sharp or masonry sand for concrete. The sand used to make concrete and mortar is known as masonry sand, and it is a fine-grained, pure kind of sand. The majority of the time, this sand is utilized in the building of patios to put down bricks, stones, or blocks. The form of the grain particles is likewise often angular and pointed.

To know when your concrete is ready, use the back of a shovel to smooth the surface. Then make a groove in it with the side of the shovel. If the surface stays smooth and the sides of the groove hold their shape, your concrete is ready. If you can't make a distinct groove, add more water. If the groove caves in, add more dry ingredients.
