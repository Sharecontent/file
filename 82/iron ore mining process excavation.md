## Mining Excavation Methods - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Truck and shovel excavation systems are very common and efficient methods in surface mining. They are very adaptable to change in peak geometry in the advent of variations to geology or to sudden failures. They involve a relatively low capital cost and additional equipment can be obtained at short notice. In addition, they have higher resale value.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
