Oct 28, 2021It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.

## Gypsum is used in cement to avoid flash-set
The main purpose of adding gypsum in the cement is to slow down the hydration process of cement once it is mixed with water. The hydration process starts when water is added into cement. Water reacts with C3A and hardens. This happens in a very short time, which doesn't allow cement for transporting, mixing, and placing with construction

## What is the purpose of adding Gypsum to the cement?
Crystals of gypsum are produced when Plaster of Paris is mixed with water. Gypsum is calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO 4 .2H 2 O) and a mineral used in cement manufacturing. It helps in controlling the rate of hardening of the cement. A small amount of gypsum is added to the clinker upon its cooling during the final grinding process.

## Gypsum Is Essential and Necessary to Cement | Fote Machinery
It takes a long time for the cement to hydrate and harden and needs enough water to ensure hydration. For ordinary Portland cement, the addition of gypsum is kept between 3% and 4%, while for quick-setting cement, the gypsum addition can be 2.5%. If your cement contains a lot of C3A, it may react with excess sulfate in gypsum to form ettringite.
