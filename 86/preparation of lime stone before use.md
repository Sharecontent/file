## Calcination of Limestone - IspatGuru
The temperature required for the decomposition of dolomite and dolomitic limestone is usually in the range of 500 deg C to 750 deg C. The smaller size limestone is more suitable for calcination in rotary kilns and it allows optimum residence time. The lower calcining temperature also allows less fuel consumption.

Applying pulverized limestone increases bacterial activity in the soil, which creates a more favorable soil structure. It helps with the disintegration of organic matter and compost. This in turn makes the soil more porous, which increases the air's ability to circulate through the soil and hold and absorb water.
