##  UNIT-1 THERMAL POWER STATIONS Introduction - AITS-TPT
Figure: Schematic diagram of a Thermal power plant. Selection of site for thermal power plant • Nearness to the load centre: The power plant should be as near as possible to the load centre to the centre of load .So that the transmission cost and losses are minimum. This factor is most important when Dc supply system is adopted.
