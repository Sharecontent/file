Jaw Crusher Explained . For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Design And Construction Of Jaw Crushers
Jaw-crusher Construction. Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines and hence must be robustly constructed. The main frame is often made from cast iron or steel, connected with tie-bolts. It is commonly made in sections so that it can be transported underground for installation. Modern jaw crushers may have a main frame of welded mild steel plate.
