Jaw crusher movement is guided by pivoting one end of the swinging jaw. and an eccentric motion located at the opposite end. [4] The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws .For instance, a 22 x 30 jaw crusher has an opening of 22" by 30", a 46 x 46 jaw crusher has a opening of 46" square.

Jaw Crusher Explained . For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

## Design And Construction Of Jaw Crushers
Jaw-crusher Construction. Jaw crushers are heavy-duty machines and hence must be robustly constructed. The main frame is often made from cast iron or steel, connected with tie-bolts. It is commonly made in sections so that it can be transported underground for installation. Modern jaw crushers may have a main frame of welded mild steel plate.
