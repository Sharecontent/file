## What is Open Cut Mining? | Bravus Mining & Resources
Open-cut mining is a process of resource extraction where it is dug up from the surface. Also known as open-pit mining or open-cast mining, it is the most common form of extraction for minerals or coal in Australia. The technique of open-cut mining is used when the deposits are close enough to the surface to be readily extracted.

Box Cut. Box cut (mining) is a cutting technique. In general, this cut is downcast adequately until, rock not worn by exposure to the weather is found in order to permit the progress of the decline. This type of cut is created to provide a secure and safe portal as way in to a decline to an underground mine. In most mining areas, it is box cut
