4. The number of blows which the concrete can withstand before reaching the 'no-rebound' condition indicates a definite state of damage. Generally, for a given type of aggregate, the higher the compressive strength of the concrete the lower the energy absorbed per blow before cracking, but the greater the number of blows to reach 'no-rebound'.
