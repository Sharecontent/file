Thorium 232. Thorium 232, which alone makes up nearly all natural thorium, is the most common isotope of thorium in nature.This isotope has the longest half-life (1.4 x 10 10 years) of all isotopes with more than 83 protons. In fact, its half-life is considerably longer than the age of Earth. Therefore 232 Th belongs to primordial nuclides.. 232 Th decays via alpha decay into 228 Ra. 232 Th

thorium processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Thorium (Th) is a dense (11.7 grams per cubic centimetre) silvery metal that is softer than steel. It has a high melting temperature of approximately 1,750 °C (3,180 °F). Below about 1,360 °C (2,480 °F), the metal exists in the face-centred cubic (fcc) crystalline form; at higher temperatures up to its melting point

This can be done by buying thorium ore from a company that sells it, or by finding a thorium-rich location and mining the ore yourself. Once you have a thorium sample, you will need to build a reactor vessel. This can be done by welding a steel container together, or by using a pre-made reactor vessel that is available for purchase.

##  Separation of Scandium and Thorium in the Processing of Scandium Rough 
Uranium-232 with decay products has a speciﬁ c power of energy release eight times higher than 238Pu [3]. Thorium-230 (historical name is ionium) belongs to the radioactive family of uranium-238 (238U, 230Th, 226Ra, 210Pb). It is formed as a result of the α-decay of uranium-234, which has a half-life of ~2.5 × 105 years.

## Nature, Sources, Resources, and Production of Thorium
In uranium ore deposits, thorium is concentrated in thorite and thorianite. In magmatic carbonate-enriched rocks (carbonatites), thorium is associated with rare earth elements (REE) in bastnaesite. However, the most important reserves of thorium occur in placer deposits, which contain monazite. Monazite is in placer deposits mined together with

## Uranium decay series-in-gadderbaum
The radioactive decay series of 238 U is complex and produces alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. The figure below shows the important isotopes in the decay series, indicates whether the primary decay mode is via alpha or beta emission, and gives the half-life.. "/>
