## Siderite - Sandatlas
Siderite is some shade of brown or brownish yellow. It is more dense (3.96) than other common carbonates because of iron content. It occurs as an earthy mass or as concretionary nodules (clay ironstone) in iron-rich sedimentary rocks. Crystals form in hydrothermal veins and it may be found in banded iron formations from the Precambrian.

## Siderite deposits in northern Italy: Early Permian to Early Triassic 
All types of deposits show similar major- and rare-earth (REE)-element patterns, suggesting a common iron-mineralizing event. The compositions of coexisting siderite, Fe-rich dolomite and calcite suggest formation from hydrothermal fluids at relatively high temperature conditions (≥ 250 °C).

## Siderite
Siderite is a mineral composed of iron(II) carbonate (FeCO 3).It takes its name from the Greek word σίδηρος sideros, "iron". It is a valuable iron mineral, since it is 48% iron and contains no sulfur or phosphorus. Zinc, magnesium and manganese commonly substitute for the iron resulting in the siderite-smithsonite, siderite-magnesite and siderite-rhodochrosite solid solution series.

siderite, also called chalybite, iron carbonate (FeCO3), a widespread mineral that is an ore of iron. The mineral commonly occurs in thin beds with shales, clay, or coal seams (as sedimentary deposits) and in hydrothermal metallic veins (as gangue, or waste rock). Manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), and calcium generally substitute in part for iron; siderite forms a complete solid-solution

## Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey » Siderite
Formula: FeCO3 Hexagonal. Description: Siderite forms as a sedimentary precipitate, in hydrothermal veins, in metamorphic rocks formed from such protoliths, and, rarely, in pegmatites. In sedimentary environments it forms in extensive beds of banded iron formations and as more localized deposits of bog-iron ore. It readily weathers to iron oxides.

Siderite is an ore of iron when found in sufficient volume to be economically recoverable. It was named in 1845 from the Greek word meaning "iron," in allusion to its composition. It is most often found in bedded sedimentary deposits with shales and coal beds and also as bog deposits.
