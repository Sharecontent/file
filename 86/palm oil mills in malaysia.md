## The Oil Palm Wastes in Malaysia - IntechOpen
Palm oil mills in Malaysia typically meet most of their electricity and process steam requirements by burning some of the wastes, with energy for start-up generally being provided by back-up diesel [13,28,30]. Not all of the wastes are burnt. For each kg of palm oil, electricity consumption is around 0.075-0.1 kWh and steam demand around 2.5 kg.
