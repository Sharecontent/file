Lithium extraction from hard rock ores is a relatively complex and energy-intensive process, involving multiple process stages to release the lithium from the ore. How is lithium extracted from minerals? Lithium occurs naturally in over 145 minerals, but is commercially extracted from just five. The most important mineral source is spodumene.

## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have Enough?
The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.
