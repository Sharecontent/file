## Modelling and simulation of process: machine interaction in grinding 
The aim is an exact modelling of the grinding processes, the surrounding machine structures, and the interaction effects. In Sects. 2 and 3, several methods to model both, the grinding process, and the machine structure are presented. In order to simulate interaction effects, process and machine models have to be coupled.

Grinding is an abrasive machining process capable of achieving tolerances and surface finishes unattainable by any other process. When dimensional accuracy is unobtainable with milling, turning or electrical discharge machining (EDM), or when tolerances below ±0.0002 inch are required, grinding steps in. Grinding can repeatedly deliver accuracy as tight as ±0.00003 inch and do so repeatedly
