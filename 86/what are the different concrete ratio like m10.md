## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## What are the Correct Concrete Mixing Ratios - Ratio Chart
When making your own concrete it's important to use the correct concrete mixing ratios to produce a strong, durable concrete mix. Some basic mixing ratios for concrete are 1:2:3, 1:3:3, 1:2:4. These mixing ratios are based on the proportions of cement : sand : stone in that order. The ratio you use will depend on what psi strength you need.

The preferable mortar mix ratio for pointing is 1-part mortar and either 4 or 5 parts building sand. The ratio will vary depending on what exactly is being pointed. For bricklaying,. The water to cement ratio is calculated by dividing the water in one cubic yard of the mix ( in pounds) by the cement in the mix (in pounds). So if one cubic yard of the mix has 235 pounds of water and 470 pounds

Modify the concrete mix . Use a low water-to- cement ratio . Install joints. Be active in deciding where control joints will be placed. Properly cure the concrete . Cover the concrete crack using an epoxy paste (can be applied using a putty knife) along the crack length that will dry in about 30 minutes.

## Different Grades of Concrete, Their Strength and Selection for 
So, suitable grade of concrete can be selected based on structural requirements. Nominal mixes for grades of concrete such as M15, M20, M25 are generally used for small scale construction. Large structures have high strength requirements, thus they go for higher grades of concrete such as M30 and above. The mix proportions of these concretes

Although the IS Code gives nominal and standard mix ratios for different construction work based on experience and testing.  and M 35 are used for RCC ( Reinforced Cement Concrete ) like foundations, footings columns, beams, slabs etc. M-40 grade is used  Ordinary Concrete M10, M15, M20, Standard concrete M25, M30, M35, M40, M45, M50, M55

## What Are The Different Concrete Ratio Like M10
Understanding Concrete Grades . Based on strength, concrete is classified into different grades like M5, M7.5, M10, M15, M20 etc. In concrete grades, the letter "M" stands for "Mix" and the following number stands for characteristic compressive strength of concrete .
