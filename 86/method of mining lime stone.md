Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

MINING METHODS. The method of extracting the ore is dependent upon the nature of the ore occurrence. Each orebody is a problem in itself. All influencing factors, as size, shape, position, nature and grade of an orebody, and character of the enclosing walls, are fully considered before the method of extraction is decided.
