## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Next, the lower-grade ore was concentrated by crushing and mechanically separating the heavier metal particles from the lighter waste rock. Copper concentrates were "roasted" in furnaces to remove part of the sulphur. Roasted concentrates were then smelted in a blast or reverberatory furnace to further remove impurities.

## Iron Forge in Colonial America - Revolutionary War Journal
By the late 1600's and early 1700's, iron ore was still being mined in Virginia and western Massachusetts. Small scale bloomeries, the most primitive form of smelting, reduced the ore into a porous mass of iron slag called bloom or sponge iron.The bloom was hammered into a low quality wrought iron by using hand held or large, heavy hammers powered by water.
