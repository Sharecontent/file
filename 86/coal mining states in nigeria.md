The coal found in Nigeria is said to be of very high quality. In the 1940s, mining and exportation of coal were major sources of foreign exchange in the country, but many mines were abandoned due to the Nigeria civil war. Mining of coal and other minerals like iron ore are still going on in the country though on a low key.

What is Nigeria's coal policy? The National Energy Master Plan (NEMP) of 2014 foresaw a major role for coal. It calculated the role of coal, and its potential contribution to Nigeria's total electricity supply under different national economic growth scenarios, such as 7%, 10%, 11.5% and 13% annual GDP growth rates.
