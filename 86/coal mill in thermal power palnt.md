## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin

In modern thermal power plants coal grinding mills are an important and very frequent subsystem. As time passes the grinders in the mills become depleted and the functionality of these mills decreases. Because of that the mills need to be stopped periodically, every 1500 hours, so they can be checked and, if necessary, repaired. During

Dry Fog Dust Separation ( DFDS) System. They are used to control the fine dust particle Produced during the coal flow. DFDS system uses high pressure of air (about 3-4 bar) and low pressure of water (about 2-3bar),which generates dry fog and being sprayed at the point of dust generation .The spray angle covers 30 to 90 degree.

## What are Coal feeders? Principle, components.
What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).. The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume fraction.

Pulverized coal is the most efficient way of using coal in a steam generator. The coal is ground so that about 70 % will pass through 200 mesh (0.075 mm) and 99 % will pass through 50 mesh (0.300 mm). A pulverized coal boiler can be easily adapted for other fuels like gas if required later without much difficulty.

Sep 23, 2021A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin
