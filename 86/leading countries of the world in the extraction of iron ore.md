Thus, iron ore mining is the process of extraction of metallic iron. The rocks are mixed with water and then undergo smelting process. Iron ores are used to produce iron, which in turn are used to produce steel. Iron ore mines are currently mined in more than 50 countries around the world. | PowerPoint PPT presentation | free to view

The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.
