## Iron Scrap - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
M.S. El-Eskanadarny,  S.M. Al-Salem, in Sustainable Resource Management, 2021 3.1.2 Source of iron waste. Steel and cast iron are the essential recyclable metal alloys. Cast iron is produced in foundries through the melting of either pig iron or iron scrap iron. In this melting process, selected metallic alloying element(s) can be added to the scrap in part to improving its corrosion and
