## Making tiles from recycled glass | About Glass Tile
There are three common methods of making tiles from recycled glass: Small mosaic tiles are usually made from glass that is brought to a molten state along with glass color, poured over an iron table and pressed with a form (cookie cutter) to create the small mosaics. This technique involves small batch sizes and labor-intensive process of tile

## Glass Sand - Banglapedia
Glass Sand A special type of sand that is suitable for glass making because of its high silica content, and its low content of iron oxide, chromium, cobalt and other colourants. The process of transportation and sedimentation of sand followed by concentration of quartz in significant volume along with the removal of other minerals leads to the accumulation of glass sand.

## Why does sand become glass?f
In order to make glass, sand must be heated at an extremely high temperature. After this process is completed, the artists will mold and bend the glass to create the functional purpose. This process can vary in range, but generally the industrial side is around 7-10 minutes, while the artistic side can be 1-2 days.

Who would have guessed you could make glass by running high voltage electricity through sand?! I was working on some experiments with a former student and he suggested that we should try to run electricity through sand to see if it would melt the sand into glass. And, believe it or not, it worked! We made glass! What is glass made of? Glass is made from melted and recrystallized silicon dioxide.
