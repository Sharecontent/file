## During leaching of alumina from bauxite bauxite is digested?
Alumina is produced from bauxite, an ore that is mined from topsoil in various tropical and subtropical regions. The Bayer process, discovered in 1887, is the primary process by which alumina is extracted from bauxite. To produce pure aluminum, alumina is smelted using the Hall-H√©roult electrolytic process.

[SOLVED] 19. Explain leaching of alumina from bauxite. leaching of alumina from bauxite diagram 19. Explain leaching of alumina from bauxite. Ans: Bauxite contains impurities like SiO2, Ferric oxide (Fe,03), TiO2 (Titanium oxide). Bauxite is powdered and digested (heated) with concentrated NaOH at 473 523 K and 35 to 36 bar pressure.
