## Common Failures Of Bucket Elevator
Here are four aspects for you to make a brief introduction. 1. Slipping of hopper belt. Bucket elevator uses friction moment between hopper belt and head wheel drive shaft to lift and transport materials. Inadequate tension of hopper belt will lead to slippage of hopper belt. At this time, the machine should be stopped immediately and the
