## What Is Aggregate Value?
The aggregate value is a mathematical term used to refer to the collective sum of a number of smaller sums. The term is typically used when an individual or group needs to analyze data from multiple data sources. The aggregate value is intensively used in the daily work of individuals such as accountants, statisticians, economists and financial analysts.

Aggregate crushing value test on coarse aggregates gives a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate crushing under gradually applied compressive load. Coarse aggregate crushing value is the percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under standardized conditions.
