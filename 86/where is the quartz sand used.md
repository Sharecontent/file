Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand but it can also contain significant amounts of feldspar and sometimes silt and clay. Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz is called quartzose sandstone. Where does sandstone come from? Sandstone forms from beds of sand laid down under the sea or in low-lying areas on the continents.
