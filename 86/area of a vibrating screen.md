## Advantages Of Vibrating Screen
What is a vibrating screen? As the name implies, the design of a vibrating screen is based on the principle of transmitting vibrations to the screen surface in order to separate and sort different particles by size.. Regardless of the design of the machine, the principle remains the same: the vibrations break the surface tension between the particles, thus forcing them to separate.
