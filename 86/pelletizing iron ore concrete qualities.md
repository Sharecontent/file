Pelletizing is the process of converting very fine iron ores into spheres (normally 8mm-20mm in diameter), known as pellets. These pellets are suitable for both blast furnaces and direct iron reduction processes.. Pelletizing normally has four processes: (i) receipt of raw materials, (ii) pretreatment, (iii) balling and (iv) induration and cooling. Receipt of Raw Materials:

## pelletizing iron ore gold
Iron ore pellets are marble-sized balls of iron ore that are fused with clay for transportation, and used in steel manufacture. The process of making pellets from iron ore is called pelletizing. The manufacture of steel from a low-grade iron ore involves processes like mining, crushing, separating, concentrating, mixing, pelletizing, and shipping.
