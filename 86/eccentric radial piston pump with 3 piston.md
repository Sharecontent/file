## Compact Eccentric Radial Piston Hydraulic Machine - Patent
A high efficiency diametrically compact, radial oriented piston hydraulic machine includes a cylinder block with a plurality of cylinders coupled to a first port by a first valve and to a second port by a second valve. A drive shaft with an eccentric cam, is rotatably received in the cylinder block and a cam bearing extend around the eccentric cam.

## What is a piston pump? its working, types, advantages & disadvantages 
4) Radial Piston Pump. Radial piston pumps have a series of pistons in a cylindrical block that surrounds the rotor hub. The cylinder consists of a shaft, a piston, and a rotor. The pintle moves the fluid in and out of the cylinder. Image source - Hydrowatt. The rotor is eccentrically attached to the pump housing.

## Piston Motor | Types, Diagram, Working, Advantages
swash plate piston motor. Radial Type Piston Motors. Construction and Operation : The operation of a radial type piston is also essentially the same as that of an radial piston pump except for the direction of flow . Fluid enters the piston chamber through a central eccentric cam. The piston is forced radially outward against the thrust ring, thereby producing a force tangent to the piston
