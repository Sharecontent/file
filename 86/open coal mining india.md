## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

In India coal seams with inclination as steep as 1 in 3 have been worked by mechanised opencast mining methods in Karanpura field. Seams at shallow depths which are actively gassy, liable to spontaneous heating or with bad roof should preferably be extracted by quarrying as the mining legislation for underground working of such seams is stringent.
