The KB pistons have shown improvement in power, fuel economy, cylinder sealing, service life, and cost effectiveness. NOTE::: (The reduced thermal expansion rate allows the piston to be run with reduced clearance.) A tight piston is less likely to rock, make noise, and burn oil. A rocking piston wears rings and increases blow-bye.

The main purpose of a crusher is the size reduction of the feed. This size reduction is achieved by applying a force to the material, creating cracks in the material which in the end will cause the material to break into smaller pieces.  Gyratory crushers generally cost less than $1500 per hour to run, while Jaw crushers cost less than $200

## Tips to maximize crushing efficiency - Pit & Quarry
Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine. To apply what this means to your crusher, operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands. In the past, quarries produced a range of single-size aggregate products - up to 40 mm in size.
