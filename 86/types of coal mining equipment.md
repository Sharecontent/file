## Dragline Excavators and Mining - Equipment & Contracting
For large mining operations a bigger, heavier dragline excavator is needed. This type of equipment must be built onsite. It would cost too much to transport. These huge dragline excavators are meant to stay in place - and in service - for decades. Onsite dragline excavators are typically used in coal and oil sands strip mining.

Coal Types Uses and Formation. Jun 19 2020 There are four types of coal - peat lignite bituminous and anthracite. Each type has different proportions of carbon and thus have different uses. Peat - This type of coal has less than 40 to 50 of carbon while the remaining is moisture. This makes it difficult for us to ignite and cannot be easily used.
