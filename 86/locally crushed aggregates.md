## Locally Sourced Natural Aggregates and their many advantages
The delivered price of a metric ton of sand and gravel doubles at about 23 miles and doubles for crushed rock at about 45 miles. Transporting aggregates over long distance is expensive. As such, it is no surprise that as much as 90 percent of projects use aggregates within 50 miles of their extraction, or quarry, site.

## Having A Crushed Concrete Driveway - The Pros and Cons
One of the first major benefits of using crushed concrete for a driveway is that it is very cost-effective. Because crushed concrete is a material that comes from recycling, you'll pay far less than if you were to have freshly poured concrete. Plus, crushed concrete is far more cost-effective than paying for a natural stone driveway.
