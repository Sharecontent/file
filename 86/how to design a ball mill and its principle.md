## Ball Mill Parameter Selection & Calculation - JXSC
1 Calculation of ball mill capacity. The production capacity of the ball mill is determined by the amount of material required to be ground, and it must have a certain margin when designing and selecting. There are many factors affecting the production capacity of the ball mill, in addition to the nature of the material (grain size, hardness, density, temperature and humidity), the degree of

The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size. The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls. Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.

Business is the activity of making one's living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also "any activity or enterprise entered into for profit." Having a business name does not separate the business entity from the owner, which means that the owner of the business is responsible and liable for debts incurred by the business.

You also need a rod mill work index to design a ball mill operating on a coarse feed, above about 4 mm. Q1: You design for a typical percentage of critical speed, usually 75% of critical. Then you iterate the mill diameter using a Morrell C-model or Nordberg equation to get the RPM that corresponds to 75% for that mill diameter.
