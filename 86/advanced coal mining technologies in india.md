## Advanced Coal Technologies for sustainable power sector in India
Jul 1, 2021On an average Indian coal power plant emission were in the range of g CO 2 /kWh ( CEA., 2021 ). None of the power plants have CO 2 capture systems. Coal power plants have the advantage of a high Energy Return on Investment (EROI) rate of about 30-35, ranking third only after nuclear and hydro power plants.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## India's coal output to grow 6.6% in 2022 backed by Coal India Ltd output
The Indian Government has adopted several measures to boost the domestic supply of coal. After a 6.8% increase in 2021, India's coal production is expected to grow by 6.6% to 864.8 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022. Of the total, 93.9%, or 811.9Mt, is expected to be thermal coal and the remainder metallurgical coal.
