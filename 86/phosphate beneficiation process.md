Abstract. Beneficiation of phosphate ores by dry electrostatic processes has been attempted by various researchers since the 1940's. The underlying reasons for developing dry processes for phosphate recovery are the limited amount of water in some arid regions, the flotation chemical costs, and the wastewater treatment costs.
