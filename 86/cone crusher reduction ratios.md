## Cone Crusher Reduction Ratio Cone Crusher Machine How Does A Cone 
In the working process of the cone crusher of granite crusher, the motor drives the eccentric sleeve to rotate through the transmission device, and the moving cone rotates under the force of the eccentric shaft sleeve, and the section near the static cone becomes a broken cavity. The material is crushed by the extrusion and impact of the moving cone and the static cone.

## Cone Crusher Reduction
The chief difference between cone and gyratory or jaw crushers is the nearly parallel arrangement of the mantle and the cone at the discharge end in the cone crusher. This is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Reduction ratios in the following ranges are common for cone crushers: 6:1 - 8:1 for secondaries 4:1 - 6:1 for tertiary and quaternary crushing.

Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so, of course, crusher performance declines. These are the two main causes of sub-optimal crushing performance, but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.

cone crusher reduction ratios. Jaw crushers are operated to produce a size reduction ratio between 4:1 and 9:1. Gyratory crushers can produce size reduction ratios over a somewhat larger range of 3:1 to 10:1.

With the Cones coming it at about $140 cheaper than BC for the shorty, I'm not sure what drives anyone to the preds outside of brand allegiance or just not knowing about Cone.There's no advantage to the BCs, even if I love them as a company. Looks like you save about $50 with the long Cones vs BC.
