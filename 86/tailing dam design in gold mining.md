The 31 -meter high wall of the number four tailings dam of the Harmony Gold mine collapsed. The tailings dam is situated up-slope of Virginia in the Free State Goldfields. At least 2.5 million tonnes of liquefied tailings ripped through the mining village. Eighty houses were swept away, and 200 others were severely damaged.

## Hydraulic mining environmental effects
During the U.S. gold rush, hydraulic mining operations in California completely denuded forested landscapes, altered the course of rivers, increased sedimentation that clogged river beds and lakes and released enormous amounts of mercury onto the landscape. California wildcat miners used an estimated 10 million pounds of mercury from the 1860s.

Ponds are engineered using dams, which is why you'll also often hear the term "tailings dam," and the surrounding environment (for example, valleys).

The gold mine tailings are used to produce high quality road cement and sulfuric acid resistant cement. In addition, according to different particle size requirements, the gold tailings particles can be used directly as coarse and fine aggregates for concrete without processing, which makes concrete have higher strength and better durability.

Background. Recent major tailings dam failures have led to an industry-wide review of the design and management of tailings storage facilities. Before the 1960s, mine tailings were often disposed directly into ponds, lakes, rivers or natural topographic depressions, or stored in impoundments supported by earthen dams, without necessarily applying engineering principles (McLeod et al. 2015).

## What are Tailings - Society for Mining, Metallurgy & Exploration
Tailings are a by-product of mining. After ore containing an economically-recoverable commodity is mined from the earth, that commodity is extracted in a processing plant or mill. After the commodity of value is extracted from the ore material, the resultant waste stream is termed "tailings". Typically, mill tailings range from sand to silt
