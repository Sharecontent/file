Engobe is a specially composed ceramic slip made with a mixture of clays, fluxes and fillers which coats the substrate with a permanent opaque layer. The aim of this research was to formulate a base engobe by adapting a standard recipe to utilize raw materials that are locally available within selected states of Nigeria.

## Ceramic
A ceramic is any of the various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing an inorganic, nonmetallic material, such as clay, at a high temperature. Common examples are earthenware, porcelain, and brick.. The earliest ceramics made by humans were pottery objects (pots or vessels) or figurines made from clay, either by itself or mixed with

Projected to be a USD 400 billion global industry by 2025, ceramics manufacturing uses clay as a raw material — a fine-grained natural soil which must be mined and blended to meet precise production standards. ESAN Eczacıbaşı Industrial Raw Materials Company (ESAN) is one of Turkey's largest producers of clay for ceramics manufacturing.

## What are the Functions of each Ceramic Raw Material Used in a Ceramic Tile?
Clay serves as a binder, an inexpensive source of alumina and silica, and a suspension aid. It is the most important element in a ceramic tile body. Its functions are: 1. Gives a light coloring in firing. 2. Contributes binding and plasticity characteristics of the mass. 3. Improves mechanical characteristics in the tiles.

In the traditional ceramics industries, quartz is widely used as a raw material, either as a natural clay constituent or as an added individual raw material. Quartz plays a key role in all ceramic manufacturing process stages (plasticity control, green mechanical strength, firing shrinkage, etc.). It is, therefore, an irreplaceable raw material.
