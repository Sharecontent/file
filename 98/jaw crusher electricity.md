## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.

## Jaw Crusher | Primary Crusher in Mining & Aggregate - JXSC Mine
Product Introduction. JXSC jaw type rock crusher is usually used as a primary crusher and secondary crusher to reduce the size of medium-hard materials to smaller physical size. Jaw rock crushers are capable of working with the mobile crushing station, underground crushing because of its related small volume. Capacity: 1-1120TPH.

## stationary jaw crusher in japan
Jaw Crusher Explained . For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

The capacities are based on the crusher receiving full, continuous feed of clean, dry, friable stone weighing 100 lb/cu ft. These capacity tables show several significant differences between the two common types of primary crushers. A jaw crusher has a wider range of settings—generally, a maximum of two to three times the smallest setting.
