## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Iron ore pellets are spheres of typically 8-18 mm (0.31-0.71 in) to be used as raw material for blast furnaces. They typically contain 67%-72% Fe and various additional material adjusting the chemical composition and the metallurgic properties of the pellets. Typically limestone, dolostone and olivine is added and Bentonite is used as binder.

## The Best Types of Modern Equipment and Instrumentation for Steel 
Rolling/Finishing Mill. Hot Rolling Mills are used to reheat shapes of steel to soften them enough so that they can be rolled thinner and longer through a series of rolling stands. The finished product can be either a strip, plate, rod, bar, wire, or shape (rails and H-beams).After the hot rolling process steel is then cold rolled at much lower

## Iron Ore Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries

## Penalty Elements in Iron Ore Analysis with XRF
Silicon (Si) is a common penalty element in these iron ores. Most Si is slagged off during smelting, but at temperatures > 1300 °C (2327 °F) it can form an alloy with Fe. Aluminum (Al) is present in clays, micas, and feldspars in some iron ore deposits and in limestone flux used in steel making. Small amounts of Al (< 1%) can increase the
