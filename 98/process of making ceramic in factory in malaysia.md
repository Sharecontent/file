## Ceramic and Vitrified Tile Manufacturing Process | Civil4M
For ceramic tiles the pressing of powder is done at 450 bars of pressure and for vitrified tiles pressing is done at 550 bars of pressure. At pressing machine, we can mould any size tile by providing specification and making arrangements of mould by simply programming it with all data. Once the command is given, a fully automatic pressing

To complete the forming process, manufacturers put the ceramic piece, known as greenware, in an extremely hot oven or chimney. Sintering strengthens a ceramic part by causing its oxides to bond and desificate. During this chemical change, both ionic and covalent bonds are formed and create the ceramic's crystal structure. This process
