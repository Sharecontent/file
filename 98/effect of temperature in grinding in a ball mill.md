## Effect of Autogenous and Ball Mill Grinding on Sulfide Flotation.
The effects of grinding on the floatabilities of copper-nickel sulfides from Duluth gabbro were investigated. At the same mesh-of-grind copper, nickel, and cobalt recoveries were higher and residual sulfur in the tailings was lower with autogeneously ground pulps. With ball-mill ground pulps the residual sulfur could not be lowered even at
