A strain gauge is a sensor whose measured electrical resistance varies with changes in strain. Strain is the deformation or displacement of material that results from an applied stress. Stress is the force applied to a material, divided by the material's cross-sectional area. Load cells are designed to focus stress through beam elements where

## Strain Gauges | Electronic Components Distributor DigiKey
Strain Gauges. Strain gauges are devices used to measure strain forces on materials. The most common consists of an insulating flexible backing with a metallic foil pattern. The gauge is attached to an object with a suitable adhesive. As the object is deformed, the flexible backing and foil are deformed, causing a change in electrical resistance.
