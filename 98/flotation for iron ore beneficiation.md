##  Flotation of Iron Ore: A Brief Review - MDPI
Fatty acids are widely used as a collector in the reverse anionic flotation of iron ores. The most popular anionic collectors used in iron ore flotation practice are oleic acid and its soaps [16,26]. The oleate in aqueous solution forms different species and which species dominate is dependent on pH.

## Iron Ore Tailing Beneficiation - a Potential Resource for Future
Jan 20, 2022Tailing beneficiation of iron ore has been addressed either by flotation or wet high intensity high gradient separation. The present study aims to recover iron values from discarded slime containing assay ~56% Fe, ~6.5% SiO2, and ~7.0% Al2O3 from Noamundi processing plant by using high gradient magnetic separator (HGMS).

## Froth Flotation of Iron Ores
The reagents used in iron ore flotation, including starch, amines and fatty acids, and the mechanisms of their interactions with the minerals in iron ore are examined.  Houot, R., 1983.

## Iron Ore Beneficiation Testwork | SRK Consulting
Iron Ore Beneficiation Testwork. Iron ores come in come in many shapes and sizes (and mineralogies), so there is no one size fits all approach to beneficiation. For magnetite ores, it is typically necessary to liberate the individual magnetite grains from the host rocks, after which beneficiation is relatively straightforward due to the
