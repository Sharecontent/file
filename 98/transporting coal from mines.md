Ships. It is predicted that coal exports and, therefore, the importance of ocean transport will increase. Ocean transport of coal requires detailed considerations of (1) transportation from the mine to the port, (2) coal-handling facilities at the export port, (3) ocean carrier decisions such as number and size of ships, contractual obligations

## Coal Transportation by Truck | USA Truckload Shipping
Rail vs Road Shipping. Most of the time, coal moves directly from mines to power plants via the U.S. rail system. Many coal mines are close enough to the railroads to simply load the rail containers up on the spot and send them directly to the nearest power plant. This system works quite well—until you need to get your coal shipped anywhere else.

A method of coal transport used in some special instances, where mining is taking place in steep seams, is hydraulic transport. There are some mines (notably in New Zealand) where the coal is mined hydraulically using high pressure water jets (or "monitors" ). From that point gravity is used to carry the water and coal along steel troughs or

## How is the coal transported from the coalfields and for what is it used 
Coal can be transported from mines and processing plants to consumers in several different ways: Conveyors, trams, and trucks move coal around mines, short distances from mines to consumers close to the mines, or to other modes of long-distance transportation.  Barges transport coal on rivers and lakes.

## How Is Coal Transported - Realonomics
Railroads accounted for over 70% of coal shipments to power plants in 2005. The balance moved by truck barge and conveyor. Most coal moved by rail because coal mines are often distant from power plants and rail is usually the most economical means for moving bulk commodities long distances. Which is the most economical way of transporting coal?

## Coal Transport - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
China's coal is not only transported by rail but also uses railway-sea combined transport. It is estimated that 70% of coal transport depends on railways, 25% of coal transport relies on rail and water transshipment, and 5% relies on water transport. Fig. 8.13 shows the spatial distribution of railway transport and rail and water transshipment.

Transport of coal from mines or preparation plants to consumers is also very important for the coal cost and environment. The main methods of inland transporting of coal are rail, road, barge or other water transport, slurry pipeline and conveyor.
