The second half of the 20th century was the age of electronics, electronic devices became miniaturised and even more complex, creating problems by their energy consumption and waste heat. Spintronics promises to store or transport information based on spins alone, which would work faster with much less energy.

Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

Blast Furnace System Blast Furnace System In a blast furnace (BF) the iron oxides are reduced and the resulting iron is melted. Approximately 70% of the global steel production involves the use of BFs. Sizes of BFs installed cover a very wide spectrum, ranging from less than 100 m 3 to more than 5000 m 3.

Chinese iron ore consumption will be affected by a fall in domestic steel production, which has been impacted by low demands and the introduction of a new environmental protection law (EPL). "A downturn in global steel demand, crude steel production and iron ore prices will result in a fall in Chinese iron ore imports to 855.1Mt."

Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries. It is therefore essential for the production of steel, which in turn is essential to maintain a strong industrial base. Almost all (98%) iron ore is used in steelmaking. Iron ore is mined in about 50 countries. The seven largest of these producing countries
