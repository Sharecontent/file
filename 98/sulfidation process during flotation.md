## Flotation - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The FLOTATION PROCESS is one of the commonest methods of extracting the valuable minerals from certain classes of ores, and it is generally more efficient as regards the recovery of the minerals than any other process applicable to the treatment of similar types of ores. The metallic contents of the minerals are recovered from the concentrates in a subsequent series of metallurgical operations

## Study on sulphidization roasting and flotation of cervantite 
The sulfidation products were zinc blende, wurtzite, magnetite and a fraction of zinc-bearing magnetite. These findings can provide theoretical support for controlling the process during which the recovery of Zn and Fe is achieved through the combined flotation-magnetic separation process.
