A synthetic aggregate may also be the byproduct of manufacturing and a final burning process—blast furnace slag is an example of a synthetic aggregate. Briefly  The autoclave disruption test is a test to determine the stability of slag aggregate particles. In this test, slag samples are separated into several particle size fractions.

## Spark testing
Spark testing is a method of determining the general classification of ferrous materials. It normally entails taking a piece of metal, usually scrap, and applying it to a grinding wheel in order to observe the sparks emitted. [1] These sparks can be compared to a chart or to sparks from a known test sample to determine the classification.

In grading of aggregates, the voids in the mixed aggregate would be minimum when the sand is just sufficient to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate. Voids in the coarse aggregate are filled in by sand and voids in the sand are filled in by cement. Mix that occupies the least volume is the densest and will produce the best results.

Grading refers to the distribution of different particle sizes in an aggregate.

A sample of aggregates in surface dry condition, which pass through 12.5 mm sieve and are retained on 10 mm sieve are taken for this test (W1).

## What Is Grading Of Aggregates? And Its Limits [Civil Planets]
The grading of aggregates is the determination of the aggregate size used for construction works. The coarse aggregate is graded as per its size (10mm, 12mm & 20mm). The selection of the right coarse aggregate size depends on the specific construction activity. You will understand how grading of aggregates influences the bondage in concrete
