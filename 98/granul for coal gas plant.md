Fuel switch from coal to gas continues. Despite the sharp rise in gas prices, the overall picture still shows a fuel switch from coal to gas. In the first six months of this year, Germany's gas-fired power plants generated almost 19 percent more electricity than in 2020 and 25 percent more electricity than in 2019.The increase in coal-fired power generation is thus mainly driven by low

During the coking process, 16% of the energy was used to produce coal gas, and the rest was used to produce coke. By comparison, the energy consumption of granular coal production was only 2% of coke.
