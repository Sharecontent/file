## The European mining industry: What future? - ScienceDirect
Abstract. Europe's mining industry has a long, profitable and varied history. Now held in low regard for largely fallacious reasons, it faces many challenges. In reality, its spread and diversity surprise. Although Europe's mining industry accounts for a small share of GDP, it provides a significant share of the global production of many products.

## The history of Swedish steel industry - Jernkontoret
In the 1640's, Sweden's exports of bar iron amounted to around 11,000 tonnes a year. Fifty years later, the average was about 27,000 tonnes a year and in the 1740's an average of 40,000 tonnes a year was achieved. The large increase depended almost wholly on the emergence of new markets, firstly in Holland and then in England.

Coal miners were paid by the amount and quality of the coal they produced, and they could be fined if there was too much "slack" (the smaller pieces). Quality coal was what owners required, but managers determined the standards for quality coal. Owners could keep costs low by claiming the coal was of a poor quality or rigging their scales.

## Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe
During the Middle Ages between the 5th and 16th century AD, Western Europe saw a period of growth in the mining industry. The first important mines were those at Goslar in the Harz mountains, taken into commission in the 10th century. Another famous mining town is Falun in Sweden where copper has been mined since at least the 10th century and possibly even earlier.
