## What is the difference between hammer crusher and impact crusher?
Feb 19, 2022The impact crusher is mainly composed of a frame, a transmission mechanism, an impact plate and a rotor. The frame is divided into upper and lower parts, which are connected by bolts in the middle. The impact plate is suspended inside the crushing chamber, and the plate hammer on the rotor is its main wearing part, and most of them are of

## Jaw and Impact Crusher Maintenance - RR Equipment
I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.
