depends on the processed uranium ore grade and the processing technology. Generally, higher contents of radium always exist in association with higher grades of uranium ore. As environmental awareness increase and more stringent environmental protection requirements develop, the demand for rigid industrial effluent discharge standards increases.

Simultaneous removal (>95%) of uranium, radium, lead and polonium could be carried out by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. The side-effect of RO-technique was the quality of the effluent; the water becomes almost totally demineralized and therefore corrosive.

## Radium Removal From Uranium Ores and Mill Tailings.
Tailings Uranium mill tailings, containing radioactive and non-radioactive materials, are the solid residues and the associated liquids which remain after uranium has been extracted from the ore. The solids consist primarily of the finely-ground bulk of the original ore, and also of a variety of chemicals precipitated from the tailings liquids.

Uranium Extraction. Uranium leaching is the process by which the uranium is extracted from the raw ore by reacting the material with acid or base. Fig. 2 shows a general process flow for the uranium extraction process. Prior to the leaching process, the ore is often given preliminary treatments that can include roasting and grinding.

## Processing, Extraction & Recovery of RADIUM from Uranium Ore #5
Removal from a fusion may be accomplished by passing air or some other gas over the fusion, but it is preferable to bubble air through the fused mass or to produce in it an evolution of gas to insure the complete removal of radium emanation. PART 1: Radium, Uranium & Vanadium Extraction & Recovery from Carnotite. PART 2: URANIUM, RADIUM
