## Milling vs Grinding: What's the Difference? - OneMonroe
In Conclusion. While they both involve the physical removal of material from a workpiece, milling and grinding aren't the same. The former machining process is characterized by the use of a milling machine, whereas the latter machining process is characterized by the use of a grinding wheel. No tags for this post.

In this process copper ore is mined, crushed, ground, concentrated, smelted and refined. The mining, crushing and grinding portions of the processing are extremely energy intensive since the rock must be reduced essentially to talcum powder fineness in order to separate the copper-bearing minerals from it.
