## Cone Crusher - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Maintenance of the wear components in both gyratory and cone crushers is one of the major operating costs. Wear monitoring is possible using a Faro Arm (Figure 6.10), which is a portable coordinate measurement machine.Ultrasonic profiling is also used. A more advanced system using a laser scanner tool to profile the mantle and concave produces a 3D image of the crushing chamber (Erikson, 2014).

Best suited for secondary crushing applications, cone crushers are designed to crush pre-sized materials, usually 100mm, 150mm or 200mm, depending on the size of the crusher. Cone crushers can form finished products down to 12mm or less. Like the jaw crusher, the cone crusher provides a relatively low cost crushing solution, but there are
