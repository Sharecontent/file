## The Effect of Dolomite Additive on Cement Hydration
Application of calorimetry as a main tool in evaluation of the effect of carbonate additives on cement hydration. Calorimetry was applied to follow the hydration in the Portland cement-dolomite-limestone mixtures. In the experiments the limestone additive of various fineness (standard component of various common..
