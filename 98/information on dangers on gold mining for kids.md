## Gold Panning in Alaska, Alaska Kids' Corner, State of Alaska
Gold Panning in Alaska. Since the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867, gold mining has played a major role in Alaska's history. News of northern gold was responsible for bringing floods of people into or through Alaska; this, in turn, created dramatic bursts of population and caused the foundation of many settlements that still survive

## Mock gold panning/gold mining for kids? - New York Forum
It is a big kids activity in the mountains -- when they were little, my kids did it in both the Adirondacks and in the Poconos, usually at tourist attractions with other outdoors activities (like guided nature walks). It was panning for pretty rocks and the occasional arrow head -- I think they called it "gem mining".
