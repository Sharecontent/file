## springs for vibrating screens
Springs are critical components in mining vibrating screen elastic supports. However, long-term alternating loads are likely to lead to spring failures, likely resulting in structural damages to the vibrating screen and resulting in a lower separation efficiency.

## Vibrating Screen Working Principle - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The simplest Vibrating Screen Working Principle can be explained using the single deck screen and put it onto an inclined frame. The frame is mounted on springs. The vibration is generated from an unbalanced flywheel.  Bearings support only weight of shaft. Screen is free to "float" and follow positive screening motion without power

## Fatigue failure analysis of vibrating screen spring by means of finite 
Vibrating screens are often used in the mining industry to separate mineral particles by size. In many designs, spring arrays are used to provide the system with the necessary stiffness for screens to vibrate in a controlled manner. Naturally, these springs are subjected to varying loading cycles, which can cause their premature fatigue failure.
