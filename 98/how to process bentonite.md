## Bentonite
Bentonite (/ Ë b É n t É n aÉª t /) is an absorbent swelling clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite (a type of smectite) which can either be Na-montmorillonite or Ca-montmorillonite.Na-montmorillonite has a considerably greater swelling capacity than Ca-montmorillonite. Bentonite usually forms from the weathering of volcanic ash in seawater, or by hydrothermal circulation through the

Bentonite waterproofing is an exterior waterproofing treatment that is supposed to work by forming a barrier between wet soil and the building foundation. Like any type of clay, bentonite absorbs moisture. As water molecules bond to clay particles, the clay expands, filling cracks and gaps in the foundation so that water can't get in.
