##  A Direct Process for Wire Production from Sulfide Concentrates - Energy
Currently, the supply chain from copper mining to copper wire production is . highly energy intensive. The smelting process requires pyrometallurgy to transform copper sulfides into sulfuric acid and a solid copper product (cathode). Oxidation removes molten iron (as FeO) and sulfur dioxide (SO. 2) gas from the ore. Several reactors upstream
