## Ball Mill Explained - saVRee
If a ball mill uses little or no water during grinding, it is a 'dry' mill. If a ball mill uses water during grinding, it is a 'wet' mill. A typical ball mill will have a drum length that is 1 or 1.5 times the drum diameter. Ball mills with a drum length to diameter ratio greater than 1.5 are referred to as tube mills.

Ball mills are factory made and transported to the plant site of the buyer while VRM is built on the site of the cement plant. This helps to reduce cost and complicated logistics issues. The equipment cost is, however, higher for a VRM than a ball mill. So these are the pros and cons of the two technologies and a cement manufacturing company

An alternative ball milling technique would be useful in high-energy ball mills.  This can be seen from our results for 60NBC, which show that the average size

## Ball End Mills | McMaster-Carr
Cobalt Steel Ball End Mills with Two Milling Ends. With better heat and wear resistance than high-speed steel, these cobalt steel end mills can run at higher speeds and provide better performance on hard material, such as iron, hardened steel, titanium, and tool steel. When one end wears out, turn the tool around for a sharp edge.

## Size reduction of material using ball mill - Labmonk
PROCEDURE. Kept 100 gm of rice and charge it to series of sieves to get pregrinding size distribution. Continuous sieving for 10 minutes. Weigh the mass of rice retained on each sieve. Load the rice into ball mill along with metal balls. Run the ball mill for 30 minutes at a speed of 1 rpm. After 30 minutes take out rice powder from the ball mill.
