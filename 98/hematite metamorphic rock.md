Minerals have definite chemical compositions and physical properties. Some common minerals are feldspar, quartz, calcite, mica, and hornblend. Some minerals are valuable enough to be mined. Some of theses are the metal ores from which we obtain iron, lead, copper, aluminum, zinc, gold, and silver.

Rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones. Igneous rocks are primary rocks, and other rocks form from these rocks. Igneous rocks can be changed into sedimentary or metamorphic rocks. The fragments derived out of igneous and metamorphic rocks form into sedimentary rocks.

What Causes Metamorphic Rocks to Form? Metamorphic rocks form when the Earth's surface is changed by heat pressure and/or a physical agent. The heat from the Earth's mantle melts the rocks near the surface. The pressure from the overlying rock causes the molten rock to rise and cool. The physical agent can be a mineral that is dissolved in

Large ore bodies of hematite are usually of sedimentary origin, and it is widely distributed in sedimentary rocks as a cement. High grade ore bodies can be found in metamorphic rocks as a result of contact metasomatism. Hematite is also as an accessory mineral in igneous rocks. The red colouring of soils all over the planet is due to hematite.

## Hematite - Sandatlas
Hematite is a mineral that gives a reddish color to the soil. Here is an outcrop of laterite in Northern Ireland near the Giant's Causeway. Jasper is a reddish impure silica-rich rock. Red color is due to microscopic hematite impurities. Svinsås, Norway. Width of sample 13 cm. Jasper with micaceous hematite and magnetite. Svinsås, Norway.

All Hematite, however, produces a characteristic red streak when rubbed across unglazed white porcelain, which is why Hematite gets its name from the Greek word for blood.

Magnetite. Magnetite (or lodestone) is a common accessory mineral in coarse-grained igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. It may be gray-black or have a rusty coating. Crystals are common, with striated faces shaped in octahedrons or dodecahedrons. Look for a black streak and a strong attraction to a magnet.

Here are ten common examples of metamorphic rocks. 1. Soapstone. Soapstone is a soft, dense heat resistant rock. The metamorphism of ultramafic protoliths forms it. Its primary component is talc with traces of chlorite and carbonates. Soapstone is suitable for curving because it is soft and heat resistant. 2.

Hematite is a reddish iron oxide. It can be variable in appearance, and colors range from deep red to reddish-brown and even grayish-silver. However, it leaves a reddish streak when abraded or powdered. It is usually found in sedimentary deposits, but it can also occur as a metamorphic rock. Reddish soil is due to a high hematite content.
