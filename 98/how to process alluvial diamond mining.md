About Mining in Guyana . Guyana is generally well known for its traditional mining and production of gold, diamonds, bauxite, stone and other quarriable materials including sand and loam.  Majority of the alluvial Diamond and Gold mining operations exist within the Roraima Formation which covers approximately 12% of Guyana (26,520 sq.km).

Diamond Mining and Artisanal Mining | Keep Giving Diamonds. Most diamond mining is conducted in two ways: Diamonds are also extracted from alluvial deposits, where they are removed from sand, gravel and clay that has been naturally transported by water erosion and deposited along either the banks of a river, the shoreline or on the bed of the ocean.

## The Catastrophic Effects Of Mining Diamonds | Ethica Diamonds UK
The 3 standard types of diamond mining include open-pit mining, hard-rock mining and alluvial mining. There's also marine diamond mining which is extremely damaging since eco-systems that haven't even been fully understood are being destroyed. Each year, over 150 million carats of diamonds are extracted from the Earth through mining.

## What is Alluvial Mining: Gold, Diamonds and Platinum - Pineer Mining 
These alluvial deposits are formed when minerals are eroded from their source, and then transported by water to a new locale. When the sediments are deposited, they settle according to their weight, with heavier, more valuable minerals like gold, diamonds and platinum often being deposited at the same time. Alluvial mining can be a very simple

Alluvial mining involves the building of walls and the diversion of rivers. Once the water is emptied out and prevented from flowing into the area of interest, bulldozers are then used to exploit the ground of the riverbank. Usually, kimberlite ore can be found in depths of at least 15 meters. When the diamond-rich depth is reached, the raw

Diamonds and supplementary valuable and semi-precious gemstones are excavated from the earth level via 4 main types on mining. These diamond withdrawal methods vary depending on how the minerals are situated within the earth, the steadiness of the material neighboring the preferred mineral, and the nonessential damage done to the surrounding environment.

The term, Alluvial Mining is based from the Latin word of "Alluvius" - which roughly translated means "to wash against".This provides a better understanding of the actual process of alluvial diamond mining which is done in riverbeds and beaches where diamonds have been washed out of their host rock and transported by erosion.

Alluvial Diamond Mining is the process of extracting diamonds and other precious stones from the sand and mud found along river banks. The diamonds and precious stones have been carried by a river's force from their source in a Kimberlite rock formation and deposited along the river's banks. Small scale miners sift through the sediment deposits to find the precious stones using shovels

Open-pit mining, such as the Kimberley Big Hole, involves removing the layers of sand and rock found just above the Kimberlite. The ore in the pit is then broken up by blasting. Once this ore is broken, it is loaded and then transported to a primary ore crusher where the diamond extractor process begins.

## How To Process Alluvial Diamond Mining - Hernost Mining Machinery
Alluvial diamond mining is the process of extracting diamonds and other precious stones from the sand and mud found along river banks. the diamonds and precious stones have been carried byivers force from their source inimberlite rock formation and deposited along the rivers banks. small scale miners sift through the sediment deposits to find the precious stones.

The first diamonds discovered in South Africa were from alluvial deposits. Today, industrial alluvial diamond mining involves building a large wall to collect the water in one area. Diamonds are often found in the gravel layer, which collects under layers of other material, such as mud, clay and underwater plant-life.
