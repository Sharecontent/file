Ore-dressing methods fall naturally into two general subdivisions— (1) concentration methods and (2) direct-recovery methods (amalgamation and leaching or wet methods). Concentration methods are employed to remove worthless gangue material and concentrate the valuable minerals of the crude ore in a smaller bulk.
