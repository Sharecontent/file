## ERIC - EJ - The Analysis of Dolomitic Marble: A Multifaceted 
Marble, formed by the metamorphism of limestone, is commonly used in the construction industry and sculpting. The mineral in marble is either calcite [CaCO[subscript 3]] or dolomite [CaMg(CO[subscript 3])[subscript 2]] or sometimes both. The pure white Carrara marble from Italy was made a household name by Michelangelo, the famous sculptor of the 16th century.

## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference 
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

Lime is a mineral made by heating limestone or dolomite in a kiln. Lime is used in a variety of chemical industries, in sugar processing plants, in steel mills, sewage treatment plants, and at paper mills. "Burned" or kilned limestone was also used as plaster and mortar in the homes of early settlers, and even into the mid-20th century.

## Dolomite: A sedimentary rock known as dolostone or dolomite rock - Geology
What is Dolomite? Dolomite, also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2.Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater.. Dolomite and limestone are very similar rocks.

Most plants grow best at a pH of 6.0 to 7.4 - neutral. If the soil is lower than 5.9, dolomite lime can be used to elevate the pH so that it is a bit more alkaline and amenable to healthy plant growth. While neutral soil is preferred by most plants, soil pH occasionally can veer more into the acidic or more alkaline territory.

Lime is commonly referred to by a number of terms including quicklime, calcium oxide, high calcium lime, or dolomitic lime. All refer to the same material, lime. Dolomitic lime contains magnesium oxide (MgO) derived from the presence of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) in the initial stone referred to as dolomitic limestone.

## What is Dolomitic Limestone? (with pictures) - Home Questions Answered
Sep 11, 2022Dolomitic limestone is a type of rock that includes up to 50% dolomite. Normal limestone is primarily made up of calcite and aragonite, but dolomite forms in the stone when the calcium ions in the calcite part are replaced by magnesium ions â this process is called dolomitization. This type of rock was once referred to as magnesian limestone

## Products - Tennessee Valley Resources, Inc.
TVR dolomitic limestone is produced from the zinc mining industry. The extremely fine materials are removed from the lime leaving a remarkably uniform product that meets or exceeds state specifications for all Southeastern states. Removal of these "fines" produces an easy handling, easily stored material.
