## What is Recycled Aggregate Concrete?
Uses of Recycled Aggregate: - Building the base of a road. The underlying layer forms a structural foundation for paving. - Ready mix concrete. This is a mix of water, sand and cement. It can substitute for the brand-new aggregate. This includes uses for walkways, residential streets and concrete paving. - Stabilizing the soil.

## Concrete | Construction & Demolition Recycling Association
Concrete recycling is becoming an increasingly popular way to utilize aggregate left behind when structures or roadways are demolished. In the past, this rubble was disposed of in landfills, but with more attention being paid to environmental concerns, concrete recycling allows reuse of the rubble while also keeping construction costs down.
