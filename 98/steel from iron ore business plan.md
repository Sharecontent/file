## Could raw material shortages hinder the steel industry's green 
New, green technologies will increase the use of DRI. Direct reduced iron (DRI) accounts for 5 percent of the metallics used in the steelmaking process globally (Exhibit 1). It is currently used less commonly than pig iron or steel scrap. Traditionally, DRI is produced from the direct reduction of iron ore using natural gas, but emerging technology is enabling the production of DRI using

## Iron Ore Mining Business Plans
There is a significant scope for new mining capacities in iron ore, bauxite and coal and considerable opportunities for future discoveries of sub-surface deposits. Infrastructure projects continue to provide lucrative business opportunities for steel, zinc, and aluminium producers. Iron and steel make up a core component for the real estate sector.
