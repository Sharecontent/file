In mining, gangue (/ ɡ æ ŋ /) is  It is a necessary, and often significant, aspect of mining. It can be a complicated process, depending on the nature of the minerals involved. For example, galena, an ore of lead, is usually found in large pieces within its gangue, so it does not normally need extensive processing to remove it;

Lead was the first metal mined in Australia at Glen Osmond in South Australia in 1841, after the wheel of a cart being pulled up a rough track accidentally exposed some lead-zinc ore. In 1876, lead-silver ore was discovered and mined at Thackaringa, near Broken Hill in New South Wales, but the mines closed in 1877. Partially eroded lead

Barry County Lead and zinc mining in Barry County occurred primarily in the 1880s through 1890s, with some production in the 1910s, 1930s and 1940s (IMOP database). There was likely unrecorded production in the 1930s. The primary lead and zinc mining area was the Purdy mines area, located east of the town of Purdy. The mines are hosted by limestones of the Mississippian Osagean Series.

Mining stocks have long been attractive to investors for a couple of reasons. First, the demand for raw ore is only increasing as more and more companies use them in manufacturing. As more natural materials are mined, there is less left to mine, which should, theoretically at least, drive up prices. Plus, mining stocks often pay a dividend, which is attractive to many buy-and-hold investors
