Ore is a deposit in Earth's crust of one or more valuable minerals.The most valuable ore deposits contain metals crucial to industry and trade, like copper, gold, and iron.. Copper ore is mined for a variety of industrial uses. Copper, an excellent conductor of electricity, is used as electrical wire. Copper is also used in construction. It is a common material in pipes and plumbing material.

Solar et al. (2008) noted two trends in nickel laterites processing, one favoring high-grade ferronickel (35% to 40% Ni) and the other favoring lower grades (20% to 25% Ni). Because the ores processed vary widely in terms of nickel content and other components, it is natural that both lower and higher reduction degrees are used.
