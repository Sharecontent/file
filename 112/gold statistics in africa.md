## Mineral industry of Africa
Africa's gold mine production was 522,000 kilograms/1,148,400 pounds in 2005, which was a decrease of 14% compared with that of 2000. Production was considerably less than that of 1990 because of the long-term decline in South African production. From 1990 to 2005, Africa's share of world gold mine production decreased from 32% to about 21%.

Gold has since been moving lower, but could have possibly found a bottom in 2016. Although it remains to be seen, gold's declines from the 2011 highs could simply prove to be a pullback within an even longer-term uptrend. Examining historical gold prices can potentially be useful in trying to identify potential areas of price support to buy at.
