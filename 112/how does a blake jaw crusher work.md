Blake's design, which utilized a toggle linkage construction, was known as the Blake Jaw Crusher. Blake's crusher was announced in 1857 and patented in 1858. Perhaps surprisingly, the same basic design is still in use today for rock crushers. In the years following the design of the Blake Jaw Crusher, another type of crusher was designed.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

A Jaw Crusher is one of the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore processing plant. The size of a jaw crusher is designated by the rectangular or square opening at the top of the jaws (feed opening). For instance, a 24 x 36 jaw crusher has a opening of 24" by 36", a 56 x 56 jaw crusher has a opening of 56" square.

The Blake crusher in common with all machines of the jaw family is built into a rectangular frame, at one end of which is located the crushing chamber; in fact, the end of the box-frame constitutes the stationary jaw. The movable or swing jaw is suspended from a cross-shaft (swing jaw shaft) at its upper end, this shaft in turn being supported at each end in bearings at the top of the two sides of the crusher frame.

## What is a Jaw Crusher? - MEKA Crushing Equipment
The working principle of jaw crushers is based on the reciprocating movement of the movable jaw that compresses and crushes the rock or ore between itself and the fixed jaw, as the material enters the zone between the jaws. The moving jaw moves back and forward against the fixed jaw, and material fed from the top of the machine is compressed between the two, breaking it into smaller pieces.

A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.
