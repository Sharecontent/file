Early age cracking in concrete is caused by a combination of the chemical and autogenous shrinkage caused by the exhaustion of the water in the pores during the hydration of cement phases. Generally, this process takes place in the first 72 h of concrete casting. The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) can mitigate cracking due to several factors, among them: dilution effect

Cement Production. Cement is the binding agent in concrete. It's a mixture of different elements, which include calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. When water is added to it, a chemical reaction is activated. This causes the cement to harden, holding any aggregates in the mixture in place.

Galvanised wire is fixed inside the mould for earthing following which a right proportion of concrete mix is poured. Then, the concrete is compacted through vibration to produce high strength concrete poles. After 72 hours, the tension is released and demoulding done. The poles are put under water sprinkler system for a period of 28 days.

The production of concrete poles takes a number of non-renewable materials, such as iron, increasing its final value. Due to the low price, the wooden poles also act as market regulators. In addition, wooden poles are ecological products, since the wood used for their production usually comes from reforestation.

Process and Technology:- There are two technologies for producing concrete poles and piles-vibration process and the pre-cast spinning (centrifugal compaction) process. The spinning process is believed to be better than the vibration process. For this project idea, the spinning process is taken to estimate costs and production volume.

Galvanised wire is fixed inside the mould for earthing following which a right proportion of concrete mix is poured. Then, the concrete is compacted through vibration to produce high strength concrete poles. After 72 hours, the tension is released and demoulding done. The poles are put under water sprinkler system for a period of 28 days.

## process of production of concrete poles
process of production of concrete poles. The production of concrete poles takes a number of nonrenewable materials, such as iron, increasing its final value Due to the low price, the wooden poles also act as market regulators In addition, wooden poles are ecological products, since the wood used for their production Prestressed Concrete Cement
