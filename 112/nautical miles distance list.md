Nov 23, 2021As we know, the sphere of the earth is broken up into 360 degrees. Dividing this further, each degree is split into 60 minutes. A nautical mile represents the distance of one of these minutes of latitude. This is essentially one-sixtieth of a degree. The nautical mile represents 1/60th of a degree or 1852 meters.

## What is the difference between a nautical mile and a knot?
Nautical miles are used to measure the distance traveled through the water. A nautical mile is slightly longer than a mile on land, equaling 1.1508 land-measured (or statute) miles (1.852 kilometers). The nautical mile is based on the Earth's longitude and latitude coordinates, with one nautical mile equaling one minute of latitude. Knots are used to measure speed.
