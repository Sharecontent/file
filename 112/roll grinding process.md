## Grinding, hard chrome plating • Serbian Roll Service Company doo
Grinding represents a process that is done on the grinding machine where the roll surface is brought into an optimal condition by fine stock removal of roll material measured in micrones (value of roughness and stock removal).. Grinding operations prevent later splashing and popping of chrome layer from the roll surface which can result as a chrome peeling.

## What are the benefits of rubber roll grinding machine? - Arvind Rub-Web 
What is a grinding machine? It is a mechanized machine used in the process of grinding. With an abrasive wheel, the grinding process takes place. Therefore, the abrasive machine acts as the cutting tool. A small chip from the workpiece gets cut by each grain present inside the abrasive wheel's surface through shear deformation.

Rolling Process Definition. The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.
