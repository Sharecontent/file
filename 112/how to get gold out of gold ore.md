We used mercury to get the gold out of the powdered rock. Gold, like most minerals, can be 'dissolved' in mercury to form what's called an amalgam. An amalgam is a physical mixture, a type of alloy. This is a comparatively straightforward way of separating the gold from the rock, as the rock remains untouched by the mercury.

Leaching dissolves the gold out of the ore using a chemical solvent. The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon.

The simplest method of placer mining is panning. Here the miner swirls the mixture in a pan rapidly enough to carry the water and most of the gravel and sand over the edge while the gold remains on bottom. This was the classic method used by the Forty-Niners during the California gold rush of 1849 and has been immortalized in story, art, and song.
