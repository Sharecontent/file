## Ball Mill Capacity and Power Consumption Relationship to Mill Speed
Nov 16, 2020The acceleration factor of the ball or rod mass is a function of the peripheral speed of the mill. Thus. n = c9np/√D, the above equation becomes P = f1 (D²)·f5 (πD c9 np/√D) = cs np D2.5. As a first approximation, the capacity, T, of a mill may be considered as a function of the force acting inside the mill.

The operating principle of the ball mill. Energy consumption for ball mills is a function of many factors: the physical properties of the ground material — its specific gravity and hardness; the degree of drum filling by grinding balls; the number of drum rotations, etc. Ball mills have low efficiency — no more than 15%.

## Ball Mill - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A feature of ball mills is their high specific energy consumption. A mill filled with balls, working idle, consumes approximately as much energy as at full-scale capacity, that is, during the grinding of material. Therefore, it is most disadvantageous to use a ball mill at less than full capacity.

## power consumption of ball mill
Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills . Aug 01, 2001 The specific power consumption for these two ball shapes is shown in Fig 16 For N≤75% there is no change in the mill power draw This occurs because the center of mass of the charge is little changed by the particle shape at these speeds At intermediate speeds, the power draw for the noncircular balls falls off rapidly
