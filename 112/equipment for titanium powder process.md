## Performance Of Titanium Powder Produced By Direct Crushing Method
The titanium powder produced by this method is easily polluted by air and crushing equipment during the grinding process, so the purity of the product is not high, especially the content of oxygen and iron is high. If the titanium metal chips are cooled to -130 ° C and grinded in a vortex grinder, the quality of the titanium powder can be

## Titanium powder: Safe production and processing in AM
Using Praxair's in-situ process, titanium powders are passivated prior to reaching the cyclone collection and are deemed safe to handle after dropping below the aforementioned MIT (°C in air). This not only increases the productivity of titanium powder production, but also greatly diminishes the hazards of the powder.
