## Kaolin | AMERICAN ELEMENTS
The name entered English in 1727 from the French version of the word. William Cookworthy, who was looking for a source of material to produce white chinawares, discovered kaolin in Cornwall, England in 1745. Used in the production of common pipes for centuries in Europe and Asia, Kaolin is most commonly used today in the paper-coating industry.

## Functional Kaolinite - Detellier - 2018 - Wiley Online Library
This paper shows how the future of the use of kaolinite will shift from its traditional uses in ceramics, tiles and paper coating to more sophisticated, high value-added, uses. In particular, research should amplify in the years to come to design an efficient and cost-effective method to produce kaolinite with nanotubular morphology.
