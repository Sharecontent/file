Gold. Gold is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis, from the collision of neutron stars.

## The Use of Mercury in Gold Mining - Right for Education
It is used in gold mining to extract gold from rocks. A puddle of mercury is poured onto a pile of crushed rock. The mercury and the rock are then mixed. Any gold will leave the rock and stick to the mercury to form blobs. The mercury is then blowtorched and it evaporates (turns from a liquid into a gas), leaving the gold behind.

## What Were Some of the Tools That Were Used in the Gold Mines?
5 Pans. Panning for gold was also known as "placer mining." Early miners sat by riverbeds, scooping wet soil into shallow metal pans. They swirled the pans, washing away the dirt to hopefully discover particles of gold. Though more complex equipment was eventually invented, pans were still a useful tool to distinguish gold from dirt.

Mercury has long been used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) to extract gold from ore sediment and rock deposits. ASGM accounts for more than a third (38%) of all anthropogenic mercury emissions to the atmosphere, with most ASGM sector-related mercury emissions coming from the burning of mercury-gold amalgam.

## LBMA | Density of Gold
At just below its melting point of 1064°C, the density of gold is 18.31 (compared with 19.32 at room temperature). The density of molten gold at just above the melting point is 17.19. When molten gold solidifies there is thus a reduction in volume of 6%. This is why a shrinkage depression normally forms on the top surface of a large cast bar.

Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

Gold is one of the densest of all metals. It is a good conductor of heat and electricity. It is also soft and the most malleable and ductile of the elements; an ounce (31.1 grams; gold is weighed in troy ounces) can be beaten out to 187 square feet (about 17 square metres) in extremely thin sheets called gold leaf.

## What Is The Density Of Gold? | American Bullion
Also, its density is 19.32 grams per cubic centimeter or 19 320 kilograms per cubic meter. Density is the mass of an object per unit volume. In simpler terms, the density of gold is the amount it weighs per volume. Determining the density of gold in most gold-bearing objects can be a little bit critical as most gold items are not pure gold.

## The Borax Method of Gold Extraction for Small-Scale Miners
An obvious drawback of this method is the toxicity of mercury.2,3 The health risk of mercury is well known today in many parts of the world, but in remote small-scale mining (SSM) communities that knowledge is still scarce.4 Gold extraction by amalgamation releases large amounts of mercury into the environment as metal mercury, which is later transformed to metholated mercury, a powerful
