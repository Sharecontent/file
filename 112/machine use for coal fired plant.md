## Coal Power Impacts | Union of Concerned Scientists
Coal impacts: water pollution. When you burn charcoal in your grill at home, ash is leftover. The same is true for coal-fired power plants, which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year. More than half of that waste ends up in ponds, lakes, landfills, and other sites where, over time, it can contaminate waterways and drinking water supplies.

Duke Energy has used coal to produce energy in the Carolinas since 1911. The first coal-fired plants in Greensboro, N.C., and Greenville, S.C., originally only supplemented the company's use of hydroelectricity. This changed in the 1920s when energy demand exceeded what the hydroelectric stations could generate.
