Sand mining in South Africa is controlled by a complex regulatory system that can be distilled into three main themes: mineral regulation; environmental regulation; and land use planning regulation. In this thesis, it is hypothesised that sand mining is subject to all three regulatory themes equally. In practice, however, the regulatory system

The value of illegal mining and dealing of metals and diamonds in South Africa is estimated to be more than R7-billion a year, says PwC. In its latest edition of SA Mine, the professional services firm equates this to revenue generated from 430 000 oz of gold at the current market price.

## The Threats Posed By Illegal Sand Mining In South Africa
In 2015, years of illegal sand mining in the Umvoti River combined with historically low precipitation levels to make it impossible to extract drinking water from the river system. This caused a complete failure of the water supply for 27,000 homes in KwaZulu-Natal, and it took three weeks to correct the problem at a cost of millions of Rand.
