Limestone. Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of the mineral calcite and comprising about 15% of the Earth's sedimentary crust. It is a basic building block of the construction industry (dimension stone) and a chief material from which aggregate, cement, lime and building stone are made. 71% of all crushed stone produced in the U.S. is either limestone or dolomite.

## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
Spotted: The current process for creating portland cementâone of the world's most common building materialsâconsists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.
