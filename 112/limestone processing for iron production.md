## Algae-grown limestone could be the key to 'carbon negative' cement 
Spotted: The current process for creating portland cement—one of the world's most common building materials—consists of heating limestone to high temperatures.Today, limestone for cement production is quarried. As a result, the heating process releases carbon that would otherwise be locked away in the earth into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide.
