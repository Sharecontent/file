Karst poses many geotechnical concerns such as subsidence, sinkholes, uneven structural support, high groundwater production, and groundwater sensitivity to contamination. Grouting is often used to mitigate many of these concerns. Grouting in karst poses unique challenges due to the nature and distribution of karst features in the subsurface.

Grouting is the process of injecting liquids, mixed suspensions, or semi-solid mixtures under pressure to achieve one or more desired end results in terms of engineering properties. Grout differs from mortar since it is poured rather than spread into place with a trowel. Cement, fine or coarse sand, water and a small amount (if any) of grouting.
