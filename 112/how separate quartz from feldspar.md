Sep 5, 2022Feldspar's repeating unit is KAlSi3O8 - NaAlSi3O8 - CaAl2Si2O8. Feldspar is a less hard mineral than Quartz. Feldspar comes in a range of colours, including purple, brown, and others, due to impurities. The system's crystal structure is triclinic and monoclinic. Feldspar is commonly utilised in the ceramic and glass industries.
