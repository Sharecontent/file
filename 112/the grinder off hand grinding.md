Grinding wheels vs cutoff wheels. Long story short, grinding wheels are thick and allow you to press down while grinding for removing material. Cutoff wheels are thin and are made for straight cuts with no lateral load. Cutting wheels typically 1/16″ - 1/8″ thick. Grinding wheels typically 1/8″ - 1/4″ thick.
