The anchor is straightforward - it's the point where the bar connects to the body of the mill. The spindle rotates under power, turning the tool and creating the necessary force to cut into the workpiece. The indexable insert is the extendable part of the spindle, used to slowly propel the cutter into the workpiece.

How does a trunnion mounted ball valve work? Trunnion mounted ball valves are fitted with spring loaded seats. In a floating ball valve the pressure forces the ball against the seats, which creates a seal. In low or no-pressure situations the spring-loaded seats will create a seal, while also working for high pressure applications.
