(5) Two classes of fly ash are defined in ASTM C618: 1) Class F fly ash, and 2) Class C fly ash. Fly ash that is produced from the burning of anthracite or bituminous coal is typically pozzolanic and is referred to as a Class F fly ash if it meets the chemical composition and physical requirements specified in ASTM C618.

## Fly ash
Fly ash, flue ash, coal ash, or pulverised fuel ash (in the UK) - plurale tantum: coal combustion residuals (CCRs) - is a coal combustion product that is composed of the particulates (fine particles of burned fuel) that are driven out of coal-fired boilers together with the flue gases.Ash that falls to the bottom of the boiler's combustion chamber (commonly called a firebox) is called

Coal ash may also be recycled into products like concrete or wallboard. Does coal leave ash? The particles that remain after burning coal are called coal ash, principally consisting of fly ash and bottom ash. Other coal combustion by-products are boiler slag, flue gas desulfurization gypsum, and other kinds of flue gas desulfurization residues.

The thermogravimetric (TGA) curve (Figure 3) indicated a mass loss of 0.31% between room temperature and 100Â°C, which corresponds to loss of humidity; loss of hydration (0.55%) between 100 and 340Â°C; and loss of mass (1.12%) caused by the decomposition of CaCO 3 and the burning of residual coal of the coal fly ash between 430 and 750Â°C. Above 750Â°C, the ash had thermogravimetric stability.

Burning fossil fuels. Some of the most significant hidden costs of fossil fuels are from the air emissions that occur when they are burned. Unlike the extraction and transport stages, in which coal, oil, and natural gas can have very different types of impacts, all fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide and other harmful air pollutants when burned.
