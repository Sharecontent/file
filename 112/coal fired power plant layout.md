## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity. Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, [1] but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.

## Coal Fired Thermal Power Station Explained - saVRee
Introduction. Coal fired power stations are used to generate electricity. They are the most common type of power station and the largest global megawatt (MW) contributor of all power station types. This type of power plant has found widespread application due to its tried and tested design, as well as the cheap availability of coal.

The reason for that, is because shutting down and starting-up coal fired power plants is a rather costly and time consuming process. In the chapter, authors present outcomes of in situ tests as well as simulation modelling of reference unit operation at 40% load level that is below its safe design minimum.
