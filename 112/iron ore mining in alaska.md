## India Iron Ore Mining to 2024 - Research and Markets
India's iron ore production is estimated to have risen by 14.2% in 2019, to reach 234.9Mt, owing to the acceleration in mine production for several non-captive mines - especially from merchant miners due to the expiration of leases in March this year.

## Iron ore mining not for the faint of heart—it's a tough business
The Mont-Wright iron ore mine in Quebec produces around 25 million tonnes annually, and the Mount Tom Price mine in Australia produces about 28 million tonnes annually. The really big mines like Hamersley in Australia and Carajas in Brazil produce over 100 million tonnes per year.  For example, in Alaska, government funding provided the port
