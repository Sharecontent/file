## Aggregate Supply - Definition, Formula, Curve, Short & Long Run
The rise or fall in the aggregate demand alters aggregate supply. An increase in demand causes an increase in supply. Similarly, a fall in demand results in reduced supply. It is further classified into short-run supply and long-run supply. In the short run, supply is driven by price. In the long run, firms ramp up production. Table of contents

## Aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves - Khan Academy
The Aggregate Demand Curve. Aggregate demand, or AD, refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We'll talk about that more in other articles, but for now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.

Background. Aggregates, notably sand and gravel, are widely distributed (Figure. 2). Although the average haul is only about 25 miles, traditional local supply, of whatever type, can no longer fully meet the pattern or scale of demand in all places, or meet some needs for higher quality aggregates, notably for road surfacing..

Aggregate Demand and Supply. Aggregate supply (AS) is the supply of goods and services produced within an economy at a given time. It represents the productive capacity of the economy. The difference between AD and AS is that AD only measures what people buy, whereas aggregate supply measures what people produce.
