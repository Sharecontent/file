## How do you make a sand rake?.gh
It's fairly simple to make your own sand flea rake. Choose a piece of wire mesh that has small holes so that the tiny sand fleas will get caught in it. Bend the sides of the wire mesh inward. Drill holes 1 inch from either side of the metal scraps. Insert rivets in the four holes, making a bucket-like rake.

You don't have to drown the sand in the chemical—you'll have enough once the sand changes from looking dry to appearing wet. Allow the sand to dry.
