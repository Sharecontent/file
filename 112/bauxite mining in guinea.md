## Bauxite mining industry of Guinea and future prospects
Sep 14, 2021Bauxite is mined by open cast mining method by drilling blasting as well by the surface miner. More and more Guinea bauxite is now being exploited by a surface miner as this is found an efficient and environment-friendly technique and does not require ore crushing. PRESENT MINING AND FUTURE. In the opencast mines of CBG, Bauxite is exploited by simple drilling-blasting technique and loaded into the trucks. Bauxite is crushed, blended and partly dried at Kamsar port before export.

## Guinea coup ignites uncertainty in bauxite | CRU
Guinea has become entrenched as a major bauxite exporter to China in recent years. China imported 52.7 Mt of bauxite from Guinea in 2020. This is up 10.9% y/y, and accounts for 47.2% of all of China's bauxite imports. There is precedence for unrest in Guinea to support alumina spot prices and fuel bullish sentiment in the aluminium market.

## Guinea - Mining and Minerals - International Trade Administration
Oct 14, 2021Overview. The sector with the most potential is mining. Bauxite, iron ore, gold, and diamond mining represent key markets for Guinea and relatively well developed with tens of foreign companies actively producing and exporting minerals. In addition to these resources, Guinea has commercially viable quantities of graphite, manganese, nickel, and uranium, though these have not yet been exploited commercially.

## Mining industry of Guinea
The mining industry of Guinea was developed during colonial rule. The minerals extracted consisted of iron, gold, diamond, and bauxite. Guinea ranks first in the world in bauxite reserves and 6th in the extraction of high-grade bauxite, the aluminium ore. The mining industry and exports of mining products accounted for 17% of Guinea's gross domestic product in 2010. Mining accounts for over 50% of its exports. The country accounts for 94% of Africa's mining production of bauxite. The large miner
