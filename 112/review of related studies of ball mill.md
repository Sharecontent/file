A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## Comparative Analysis of Rod Mill and Ball Mill - ball mills supplier
The ball mill machine has the high grinding production capacity and strong adaptability to materials. The fineness of the ground product is high, and the output size is fine. The ball mill machine is suitable for materials that need fine grinding, and the energy-saving effect is remarkable, but the phenomenon of over crushing is serious.

## Ball Mill Loading - Dry Milling - Paul O. Abbe
The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%
