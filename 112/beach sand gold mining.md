## Sand Mining - Beachapedia
Another major impact of beach sand mining is the loss of protection from storms surges associated with tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Some communities affected by the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean had higher storm surges probably due to beach sand mining resulting in fatalities. Sometimes it is difficult to tell that a beach has been mined.

I'm thinking that if you're getting 100- or finer gold, don't go above 1/2 inch down from the top. Coarser material can have more material put in the bowl. 100-, only about a rounded tablespoon full. Hope this all helps. Google the blue bowl and you'll probably find a vendor with the full instructions online.

A black sand gold rush started in the summer of 1860, and by August, miles of beach had been staked off and more than 25 mining claims filed (Figure 12). The digging continued up until the 1880s when one family drilled a tunnel 300 feet long into the bluff and for a time were extracting $5 of gold for each ton of sand.
