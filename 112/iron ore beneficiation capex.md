## Iron ore pelletization - ScienceDirect
In addition, more iron ore concentrates are being produced due to the increasing need for beneficiation to upgrade low-grade iron ore resources. Although iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities, the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering.  Capex: Slightly
