## Ball Mill Loading - Dry Milling - Paul O. Abbe
The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%

## Ball Or Tumbling Mill Suitable For Size Reduction Operation
Ball mill or pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine used for size reduction of the particles. Ball mill manufacturers intend each model with a hollow cylinder which constitutes balls; mounted over a metallic frame so that it can be turned along its longitudinal axis. The balls with different diameter occupy 30-50% of the mill volume.

The mill carries out 23.5 rpm. The mill is loaded with 2200 kg balls 50 to 120 mm in diameter. The bails are sorted once a week. The ratio of large to small balls is 1:1. The mill is automatically operated, with the current intensity in the circuit of the electric motor serving as the pickup device.
