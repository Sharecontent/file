## Conveyor maintenance: Moving from preventive to predictive models
Both predictive and preventive maintenance offer cost and efficiency advantages over a run-to-fail approach, but predictive maintenance can be thought of as a more-refined take on preventive maintenance. Preventive maintenance is structured around the life expectancy of various conveyor parts such as belts, bearings, and gear motors.
