In wood-frame construction, the floating angle method of application can be used to minimize the effects of truss uplift and the possibility of fastener popping in areas adjacent to wall and ceiling intersections. The floating angle method is outlined in Section 4.9 of GA-216. Special clips may be used to create a floating angle.
