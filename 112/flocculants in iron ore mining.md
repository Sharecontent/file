A number of starches and their derivatives were tested as gangue depressants during the upgrading of magnetite-taconite concentrates by flotation. A 600-gram (dry basis) sample of a wet concentrate analyzing 64.2% iron, and having a size consist of 92% passing 325 mesh, was placed in a Denver cell and diluted to 25 percent solids.

The iron itself is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe3O4), hematite (Fe2O3), goethite (FeO (OH)), limonite (FeO (OH).n (H2O)) or siderite (FeCO3). The process of mining consists of discovery of an iron ore deposit through extraction of iron ore and finally to returning the land to its natural state. It consists of several distinct steps.
