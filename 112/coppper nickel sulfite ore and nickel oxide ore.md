Copper ore beneficiation methods. Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm.

## Heap Leaching Oxide and Sulfide Copper Ores
Accuracy. Heap leaching is a simple means of recovering copper from oxide and oxide-sulfide ores. Although this method requires relatively low capital investment, it suffers from low copper recoveries and relatively high acid consumption. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine what factors influence these shortcomings, and (2) to

Binding ration= (bonded copper oxide amount / total copper oxide amount) × 100%. There are three ways to combine copper oxide and gangue: (1) It is mechanically dispersed in the gangue to become finely dispersed inclusions. (2) Become an isomorphism in a chemical way. (3) Become adsorbed impurities.

## nickel ore processing
For a long time the main source for the nickel metal production was magmatic sulfide ore. But with the globally increased demand of nickel metal other sources become more needful. One of these nickel sources is laterite which is typically mined as low- grade deposit in open pit mines. Due to their large dimensions these mines usually contain a
