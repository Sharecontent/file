## Bentonite: Applications With Coal as Bentonite-Clay - African Pegmatite
Summary. Bentonite is a type of clay that is prized for its porosity, workability and non-toxic nature. In foundry applications, it is used with coal (bentonite-coal) in sand/green sand molding for metal castings; where it enhances the refractory properties of the mold whilst also increasing strength and flowability.

Bentonite is a clay mineral particle with two silica tetrahedral sheets and one aluminium octahedral sheet. It should be noted that the supply of K+ is the rate-limiting step in the illitization of most bentonites because Bentonite is a type of montmorillonite clay widely employed as a fining agent.

According to estimates, modern foundries in Germany, Europe and worldwide replace about 70 percent of their lost moulds with moulds made of bentonite-bonded materials. The main mould components are quartz sand, bentonite and water. These components are compacted in one of the most productive procedures in the foundry.

Bentonite is a naturally occurring chemical compound that can be broadly characterized as an absorbent smectite clay. Being a raw material extracted from minerals, it owes its name to the place where it was first found in late 19 century- Fort Benton in Montana, US. Without any treatment it has a form of odourless white or off-white powder.

Bentonite is used in retention systems and for the control of stickies and pitch. Furthermore, it helps to improve the loop water treatment which reduces water consumption. Bentonite is ideal for use in cat litter due to its unique water absorption, swelling, and odour-controlling properties. It is an excellent anti-caking agent for animal feed.
