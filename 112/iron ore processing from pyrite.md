## Iron Ore Reduction - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Iron ore reduction is an important process in the iron/steel-making industry, where iron ore is reduced to metallic iron, usually with coal, coke, natural gas, CO, or hydrogen as the reducing agents. Fig. 1. Scheme of the CBGIOR process ( Wei et al., 2017a,b ).

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)Â·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

## How many metals are present in copper pyrites?
Copper pyrites have one molecule of copper, one molecule of iron and two molecules of sulphur in it. Therefore, the chemical formula of copper pyrite can be written as : CuFeS2. The chemical formula CuFeS2 corresponds with the percentage composition of copper (Cu=34.5%), Iron (30.5%) and Sulphur (S=35%).

Pyrite seldom forms in fresh-water environments. The formation of pyrite crystals depends mainly on the iron content of the sediment. The process of pyrite formation in sediments results from the action of bacteria, which reduce sulphate ions (dissolved in the pore water) to sulphide. If there is iron present, iron sulphide crystals begin to grow.

Pyrite as an Ore of Gold. The most important use of pyrite is as an ore of gold. Gold and pyrite form under similar conditions and occur together in the same rocks. In some deposits small amounts of gold occur as inclusions and substitutions within pyrite. Some pyrites can contain 0.25% gold by weight or more.

There are 25.8 grams of iron present in 50.8 grams of iron ore.. Calculation, Firstly calculate the grams in the last 8 (100 - 92) percent before moving onto the pyrite section.. 50.8 x 0.08 = 4.064 g. Since,iron ore contain 92 percent pyrite. So, 50.8 grams of iron ore contain 50.8 x 0.92 = 46.736 g pyrite from this we need to find 46.5 percent of the iron content in the 92 percent pyrite

## iron ore processing from pyrite
CNA . Â· The invention discloses a process for smelting iron pyrite. The process for smelting iron pyrite comprises the following steps of: smelting the iron pyrite by an oxidizing smelting method to generate noble metal enriched sulfonium, high-iron melting slag, and SO2-contaiing high-temperature flue gas, allowing the sulfonium to deposit on the bottom layer of a hearth

## How Is Iron Ore Extracted - Realonomics
How Is Iron Ore Extracted? Iron is extracted from iron ore in a huge container called a blast furnace. Iron ores such as haematite contain iron(III) oxide Fe 2 O 3. The oxygen must be removed from the iron(III) oxide in order to leave the iron behind. Reactions in which oxygen is removed are called reduction reactions.
