## machining curves vertical mill
Vertical Machining, also known as milling, relies on rotary cutters to remove metal from a workpiece. Vertical machining occurs on a vertical machining center (VMC), which employs a spindle with a vertical orientation. With a vertically oriented spindle, tools stick straight down from the tool holder, and often cut across the top of a workpiece.

## Vertical vs. Horizontal Milling: Which Is Better for Your Project?
On a vertical mill, the rotary cutting head has a vertical alignment, causing the spindle to move up and down along the Z-axis while the machine is in operation. As the spindle moves, the cutters work to remove material as the rest of the machine moves and shifts along the X-axis and Y-axis to continuously position the object for further cutting.
