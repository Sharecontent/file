## Wet Milling vs. Dry Milling in the Pharmaceutical Industry
Jul 28, 2022Wet milling is also ideal when an API or excipient is heat-sensitive and cannot be subjected to higher temperatures. Whether wet or dry, milling creates heat, but in wet milling, the liquid works to quickly dissipate this heat, so operating temperatures are not as high. This protects the API from being compromised by high temperatures.
