 The Minas Gerais State (Quadrilátero Ferrífero) is the biggest iron ore producer (64.8%) in Brazil. Owing to the low grade of the iron ore (31-45 wt% Fe), beneficiation is mandatory in Quadrilátero Ferrífero. Beneficiation for the steel making industry consists of comminution and size classification followed by concentration.
