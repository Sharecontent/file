## Introduction to Workholding Solutions | Reid Supply
Jigs are tools that hold a cutting tool in place or guide it as it performs a repetitive task like drilling or tapping holes. Fixtures, on the other hand, don't guide a cutting tool, but hold a workpiece steady in a fixed position, orientation, or location.Since the advent of automation and computer numerical controlled (CNC) machines, jigs are often not required because the tool path is
