## Iron Ore Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Iron ore is obtained in the conventional method of open cast or underground mining and conveying the ore to the surface preparation are where it is crushed, washed, and transported to the smelter. Here the ore is put into a blast furnace along with limestone and coke and subjected to hot air blasting and heat which converts the ore to molten iron.
