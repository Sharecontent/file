## 3.3 - Transport Costs | The Geography of Transport Systems
Shipment Size and Inland Transport Costs 3. Types of Transport Costs. Mobility is influenced by transport costs. Empirical evidence for passenger vehicle use underlines the relationship between annual vehicle mileage and fuel costs, implying the higher fuel costs are, the lower the mileage.At the international level, the doubling of transport costs can reduce trade flows by more than 80%.

In order to ship coal in bulk by the truckload, you will first need to secure the load. The top of the truck is open to make it easy to dump in the coal, but that poses a problem once the truck starts moving. With the top exposed, loose rock and chunks of coal could fly out and hit other cars, endangering lives.
