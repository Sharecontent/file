## Car Graveyard buried in Gaewern Slate Mine, Wales
Last week I was in Wales photographing disused slate mines. This huge pile of old classic cars was dumped into the disused Gaewern Slate Mine, Wales, through a hole in the top of the mine, during the 1970's. The bottom of the mine shaft is filled with deep water. A few days ago I went into this mine to photograph the car graveyard.

In the coal mining industry of the Appalachian Basin, the word "slate" is still used by many miners in reference to the shale that forms the roof and floor of a mine, and for fragments of shale that are separated from the coal in preparation plants. Experienced miners train newer miners, and archaic language is passed along. In the 1800s, elementary school students used a small piece of slate

Slate is a fine-grained, metamorphic rock formed by compression of sedimentary shale, mudstone, or basalt. Gray slate is common, but the rock occurs in a variety of colors, including brown, purple, green, and blue. Slate consists mainly of silicates (silicon and oxygen), phyllosilicates (potassium and aluminum silicate), and aluminosilicates

## Slate industry
Slate industry. The slate industry is the industry related to the extraction and processing of slate. Slate is either quarried from a slate quarry or reached by tunneling in a slate mine. Common uses for slate include as a roofing material, a flooring material, gravestones and memorial tablets, and for electrical insulation.

## How Was Slate Formed - Realonomics
When was slate formed? They were originally formed as deep-water mudstones on an ancient sea-floor around 500 million years ago. These rocks were later uplifted folded and metamorphosed to form slates about 400 million years ago. Slate splits easily into thin sheets because of the alignment or foliation of tiny mica crystals in the rock.
