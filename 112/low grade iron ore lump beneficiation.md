##  Beneficiation Plants and Pelletizing Plants for Utilizing Low Grade 
63%, or greater, is regarded as high grade, and ore with a lower iron content is regarded as low grade. Ores are also classified as follows, according to their size and the processing method. - Lump: Ore lumps have diameters of approximately 10mm to 40mm and are charged as-is into a blast furnace or into a direct reduction furnace.

## Mineral Processing And Extractive Metallurgy : 100 Years Of Innovation 
This depends on the grade of the ores: gold grades are around 1 g gold/tonne of ore, copper ore contain around 1% metal, while iron ore with a grade of around 60%. The production of ores containing PGMs is however much smaller, only 100 Mt. Most ores are produced in open pit operations, as much as 85% varying from metal to metal.
