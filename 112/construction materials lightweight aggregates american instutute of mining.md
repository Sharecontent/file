The production of aggregates involves a relatively simple process of surface mining, crushing, sizing and, frequently, washing which requires large volumes of fresh water. Chemicals are not used in the processing of aggregates although minor quantities of a flocculent, or similar agent, may be used in removing sediments from process wash water.

## Lightweight Aggregates: How Do You Make the Right Decision  - Precast
The use of lightweight aggregates may have an impact on the compressive strength of the concrete. Highly absorptive lightweight aggregate should be wetted at least 24 hours prior to use. It is not recommended that dry lightweight aggregate be directly batched and mixed because the aggregate particles can continue to absorb water from the mix.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Construction aggregates, primarily stone, sand and gravel, are recovered from widespread naturally occurring mineral deposits and processed for use primarily in the construction industry. They are mined, crushed, sorted by size and sold loose or combined with portland cement or asphaltic cement to make concrete products to build roads, houses, buildings, and other structures.
