Granite (/ ˈ ɡ r æ n ə t /) is a coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock composed mostly of quartz, alkali feldspar, and plagioclase.It forms from magma with a high content of silica and alkali metal oxides that slowly cools and solidifies underground. It is common in the continental crust of Earth, where it is found in igneous intrusions.These range in size from dikes only a few centimeters

## Where Does Granite Rust Come From | Causes of Granite Rust | What 
Rust occurs when Iron, Oxygen, and moisture combine. When these three ingredients are combined, oxidation happens and produces a chemical reaction forming Iron Oxide or Ferric Oxide (a.k.a. Rust). With that general recipe for making rust, we can begin our discussion of rust as it relates to granite.

## Intriguing Facts About Granite Rock You Can't Afford to Miss
Granite is the most common type of intrusive igneous rock in the Earth's crust. It forms when the molten rock or magma seeps in the gaps in sedimentary rock layers, and crystallizes slowly owing to its high silicate content. The entire process takes millions of years, and is just a small part of the rock cycle.
