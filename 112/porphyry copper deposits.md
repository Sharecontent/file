## Porphyry copper deposits of the world: database, map, and grade  - USGS
In this report we have added 84 new porphyry copper deposits and removed 12 deposits. In addition, some errors have been corrected and a number of deposits have had some information, such as grades, tonnages, locations, or ages revised. This publication contains a computer file of information on porphyry copper deposits from around the world.

##  What is a Porphyry Copper Deposit? - Arizona Geological Society
Porphyry copper deposits are very large mineralized systems that are typically formed by relatively small intrusions (stocks), which are several thousand feet in diameter. These small intrusions are the solidified remains of a magma chamber from which the volcanic rocks were extruded. Hydrothermal (hot fluids) activity associated with their

## Porphyry copper assessment of the Tethys region of western and  - USGS
Of the known porphyry copper deposits, subequal fractions are spread among these three settings. The spatial distribution of known porphyry deposits and prospects is also related to the level of erosion. Magmatic belts with numerous known porphyry sites exhibit subequal areas of coeval plutonic and volcanic units and lesser amounts of cover rocks.

Porphyry copper deposits are often characterized by lower grade ores and are mined in open pits. As a result, some of the top copper mines are also among the world's largest open pits. The Bingham Canyon Mine (seen below) in Utah, United States, is the deepest open pit with a depth of 1.2 km.

## PORPHYRY DEPOSITS - Earth Sci
The term porphyry copper now includes engineering as well as geological considerations; It refers to large, relatively low grade, epigenetic, intrusion-related deposits that can be mined using mass mining techniques. Geologically, the deposits occur close to or in granitic intrusive rocks that are porphyritic in texture.

Porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) represent shallow level intrusions (2-5 km) in the crust. Mineralization of Cu ores tend to occur at the tops of porphyry systems in cupolas. Possible regimes where Cu may be mobilized include hydrothermal circulation at mid-ocean ridge centers, dehydration or melting of the subducting slab, and late stage

Porphyry copper deposits commonly yield molybdenum and silver as co-products, were. The intrusive activity responsible for Arizona's porphyry copper deposits occurred about 70 million years ago, in the Earth's crust deep below the ground surface. The rich metal deposits were subsequently exposed millions of years later by faulting and erosion.

Porphyry deposits produce approximately 60% of the world's copper. Most of these deposits lie in the Pacific Rim, also known as the Ring of Fire, an arc that stretches from Papua New Guinea to the southern tip of Chile. The copper is contained within roughly cylindrical granitic bodies that are remnants of the magma core beneath volcanoes.
