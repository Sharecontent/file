There are two types of pipe mining, namely open-pit mining and underground mining.  the kimberlite pipe that reaches the Earth's surface is eroded and weathered by wind, rain, rivers and streams.The eroded kimberlite bears rough diamonds, which are carried downstream. The first diamonds discovered in South Africa were from alluvial deposits.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.
