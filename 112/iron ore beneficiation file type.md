02 Iron ore beneficiation test plan. You need to prepare the plant before you start the iron ore beneficiation test. The plan should have a correct guiding ideology for the entire test, and rationally arrange the progress of the beneficiation test. Iron ore processing test plan is divided into two types: work plan and operation plan.

Beneficiation method of manganese bearing iron ore The content of manganese in this kind of ore is low, only 5% - 10%. At the same time, it has the characteristics of fine disseminated particle size and close symbiosis of iron and manganese minerals, so it is difficult to recover by mechanical beneficiation.

## Iron ore
Lower-grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation, using techniques like crushing, milling, gravity or heavy media separation, screening, and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities. The results, high-quality fine ore powders, are known as fines. Magnetite. Magnetite is magnetic, and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and
