## The rise of machine learning - Mining Magazine
Because of the price of analysing Big Data, people were forced to invent machine learning. That doesn't mean that you can't use machine learning for normal-sized data. For example, for exploration drilling, you might be drilling 10,000m. Let's say that's 10,000 data points, each of them with 36 elements, so that is 36,000 values.

Data mining is still referred to as KDD in some areas. Machine learning made its debut in a checker-playing program. Data mining has been around since the 1930s; machine learning appears in the 1950s.

## Top 6 Applications of Machine Learning in Process Mining - AIMultiple
Oct 1, 2021For more than a decade, machine learning has been applied to traditional process mining.Today, many vendors claim to offer AI-powered process mining software which leverages machine learning. Yet, clients do not know how the AI features are integrated into process mining, making it difficult for business leaders to understand the benefits and use cases of process mining with machine learning.

## mRNAsi Index: Machine Learning in Mining Lung Adenocarcinoma  - PubMed
The stemness index based on mRNA expression (mRNAsi) was utilized to analyze LUAD cases in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). First, mRNAsi was analyzed with differential expressions, survival analysis, clinical stages, and gender in LUADs. Then, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to discover modules of stemness and key
