## Homogenization of Cement Raw Meal - AGICO Cement Plant
The raw meal preparation process of the cement industry includes four links: mining, pre-homogenization, grinding, and homogenization, which form the homogenization chain of raw meal preparation. Raw meal homogenization is the most important process link of the four, accounting for 40% of the homogenization task.
