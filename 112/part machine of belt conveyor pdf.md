## Design of Belt conveyor system - SlideShare
The diameter of the pulley must be designed such that it does not place undue stress on the belt. The length of a belt conveyor in metres is the length from the centre of pulley parallel to belt line. Belt length is dependent on both the pulley diameters and centre distances. Capacity is the product of speed and belt cross sectional area.
