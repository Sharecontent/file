## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
How Jaw Crushers Work A jaw crusher uses compressive force for breaking ore pieces. Compressive force is applied by two jaws ( dies ), one of the crusher jaws is stationary ( fixed jaw) whilst the other is moving ( swing jaw ). Material is fed into the top feed opening (gape) and gradually moves downwards towards the lower discharge outlet.

## how does a jaw crusher works
How does a jaw crusher work? When the jaw crusher is working, the movable jaws periodically reciprocate the jaws, moving up and down. When approaching, the material is crushed by crushing, splitting, and impact between the two jaws. When leaving, the broken material is discharged from the discharge port by gravity.

## How Does A Jaw Crusher Work? - Groovy Ghoulies
Jaw crushers work according to the principle of pressure reduction. The crushing of the crushed material takes place in the wedge-shaped shaft between the fixed and the eccentric shaft moving crushing jaw. Due to the elliptical movement process, the crushed material is crushed and transported downwards.

## Crusher
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, sand or rock dust.. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
