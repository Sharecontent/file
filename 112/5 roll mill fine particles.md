The 5-roll refiners are suitable for use as a fine-refiner in chocolate processing lines. The equipment guarantees the highest product quality, flexible handling and a long life span. The two temperature controlled rolls pre-refine the sugar and the calibration of the particle size is determined by the gap between the roll and the pressure

Jet Mills. A jet mill, or fluid energy mill, grinds material by using a high speed jet of compressed air or inert gas to impact particles into each other. Jet mills can be designed to output particles below a certain size, while continue milling particles above that size, resulting in a narrow size distribution of the resulting product.

## Fine Particles (PM 2.5) Questions and Answers - New York State 
Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. PM 2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. Outdoor PM 2.5 levels are most likely to be elevated on days with little or no wind or air mixing.

Particles produced tend to be uniform in size; that is, very little fine material is generated. The shape of the particles tends to be irregular, more cubic or rectangular than spherical. The irregular shape of the particles means they do not pack as well. For similarsized particles, bulk density of material ground on a roller mill will be about 5

One can assume that a feed material is subjected to between 5 and 20 impact events in simple rotor impact mills. With fine grinding, air classifiers can be integrated into mills that allow only those particles with the desired end-particle size to pass through the classifying wheel, but which return coarser particles for final grinding.

## What Are Fine Particles?
The main difference between fine and coarse particles is size. Coarse particles (sometimes referred to as PM10-2.5) have a diameter generally larger than 2.5 micrometers and smaller than 10 micrometers. Fine particles (sometimes referred to as PM2.5) are particles that usually have a diameter equal to or smaller than 2.5 micrometers.
