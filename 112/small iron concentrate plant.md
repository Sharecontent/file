## Effect of Bentonite on the Pelleting Properties of Iron Concentrate
When bentonite content is 1.5% and 1.3%, the falling strength of the green pellet improved compared with those of green pellets that contain 1.0% bentonite. Increasing homogeneous bentonite content from 1.5% to 1.0% gradually decreases the falling strength from 3.00 times/pellet to 2.53 times/pellet.
