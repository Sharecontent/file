## What is CNC machining? | Hubs
While CNC machining is a viable and even ideal manufacturing process for many applications spanning prototyping to the medium-scale production of end-use parts, it's not without its flaws. In this section, we cover the benefits and limitations of this subtractive machining process. CNC machining offers excellent accuracy and repeatability.

## Features Of CNC Milling And Parts Suitable For CNC Milling
In the CNC milling process, generally only need to use the two-coordinate linkage of the three-coordinate CNC milling machine to process them. The curved surface of the workpiece generally refers to the surface where the points on the surface change in the three-dimensional space coordinates. It is generally designed by a mathematical model.
