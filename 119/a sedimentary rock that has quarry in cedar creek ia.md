Detritus sedimentary rocks are formed when rock fragments, debris or sediments accumulate over time and can be either organic or inorganic in makeup. These detrital rocks come together under great pressure, usually over many years. The debris, or matter that form the rocks, can be either organic or inorganic. A chunk of coal.

Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock comprised of sand-sized particles about .1 to .2 mm in size. It is usually tan, brown, or reddish in color, and often (but not always) displays noticeable layers. The sand grains are most often made of quartz, cemented together by calcite or silica.

Lithification is the hardening of layers of loose sediment into rock (Figure 4.12). Lithification is made up of two processes: cementation and compaction. Cementation occurs when substances crystallize or fill in the spaces between the loose particles of sediment. These cementing substances come from the water that moves through the sediments.
