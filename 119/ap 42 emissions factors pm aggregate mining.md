##  AP-42 Section 11.19.2 Crushed Stone Processing and Pulverized  - US EPA
Emissions of PM, PM-10, and PM-2.5 occur from a number of operations in stone quarrying and processing. A substantial portion of these emissions consists of heavy particles that may settle out within the plant. As in other operations, crushed stone emission sources may be categorized as either process sources or fugitive dust sources.
