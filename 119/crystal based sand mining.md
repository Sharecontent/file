## Sand mining a threat to the mahseer and other aquatic species in the 
Sand mining has adversely impacted the ecology of the Narmada river, including threats to fish and other aquatic species.  Bhopal-based ornithologist Mohammed Khaliq says that like every other creature, birds also need food and safe shelter to flourish and procreate. "Sand mining destroys the many aquatic animals that these birds prey upon.

## Can smart policies solve the sand mining problem? - PMC
Despite the recently growing number of sand mining studies in other scientific disciplines, the economic analysis of sand mining and trade is, to our knowledge, limited to two working papers. Hoogmartens et al. [ 15 ] examine sand extraction in Flanders based on a one-sector Hotelling -type growth model with resource extraction.

## Global sand mining is destroying the planet and costing lives
Sand mining destroys habitats, dirties rivers and erodes beaches, many of which are already losing ground to rising sea levels. When miners dig out layers of sand, riverbanks become less stable.  Rivers and People, an environmental group based in Delhi, counted 193 people who died through illegal sand mining in India over the last two years

## Mining Approaches for Sand & Gravel - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Relation to Mining. Uses. Sand and gravel deposits found on beaches or in rivers and streams, are mostly quartz (silicon dioxide, SiO2) grains. Weathering of rocks such as granite forms these quartz grains. In the process of weathering, the softer, weaker minerals in granite (such as feldspar) are weathered away.

## What Are The Negative Effects Of Sand Mining? - WorldAtlas
By removing too much sediment from rivers, sand mining also leads to the erosion and shrinking of river banks. Deltas can recede due to sand mining. All of these destructive effects of sand mining ultimately lead to the loss of fertile land and property. It also destabilizes the ground and causes the failure of bridges, dikes, and roads.
