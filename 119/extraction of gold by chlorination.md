For this reason and because of the expense of cyanide compounds, the gold extracting industry attempts to reduce or eliminate cyanidation steps in gold extraction methods. One method for eliminating or reducing the degree of the cyanidation step in a gold extraction method is the extraction of the recoverable gold with only a chlorination step.

## Chlorine extraction of gold - DUNN; WENDELL E.
1. A process for recovering gold from a gold-containing ore comprising the steps of: (a) grinding the ore, (b) oxidative roasting of the ore in the presence of a gas selected from the group consisting of air or oxygen to remove sulfides in the ore, at an elevated temperature; (c) chlorinating the ore by contacting the ore with chlorine at a

## 5 Methods of Gold-Silver Ore Extraction | Mining Pedia
Oct 16, 2020The silver chloride obtained by roasting is easily dissolved in the cyanidation process. But the chlorination roasting has the following disadvantages: 1) The consumption of sodium chloride is large (up to 10~15% of the weight of the material); 2) The chlorides of gold and silver will volatilize and escape, causing the loss of gold and silver.
