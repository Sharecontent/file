## Copper Sulfate Anode - Phosphorus Copper Process - Yosoar
The production process of phosphor bronze changed to: continuous casting, mechanical molding, cleaning, packaging. The upper lead casting is a phosphorus copper casting process that is still popular today. The advantages of this process are obvious: (1) Low energy consumption, the power consumption per ton of phosphorus copper is below 320 degrees.

Copper production process Later developments which have had more impact on copper smelting relate to an approach which combines roasting, smelting and converting steps in one reactor, thereby making the copper production process continuous. The three unique continuous processes tried in operation are (i) the Worcra process, (ii) the Noranda process and (iii) the Mitsubishi process.

## The World's 20 Largest Copper Mines - ThoughtCo
Terence Bell. Updated on November 25, 2019. The world's 20 largest copper mines produce nearly 9 million metric tons of the precious metal a year, about 40% of the world's total copper mine capacity. Chile and Peru, alone, account for more than half of the copper mines on this list. The U.S. makes the cut, as well, with two mines among the top 20.

## Copper
Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method.  Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the subject of much debate, including the concept of peak copper, analogous to peak oil.

The outcome is a "pregnant" leach solution of sulfuric acid and copper sulfate collected in a small pool. The copper compound is known to be present in concentrations of 60-70%. 2. Solvent Extraction : The solvent extraction process allows two immiscible liquids to be stirred and separated making the copper to move from one liquid to the other.

The four major steps in the production of marketable copper are mining, concentrating, smelting, and refining. In a few instances, however, leaching takes the place of concentrating, smelting, and refining. At present, although considerable leaching and direct-smelting ores are produced, the bulk of the copper ore mined is concentrated.
