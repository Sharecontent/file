## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

## Dolomite Mineral | Uses and Purposes - JM Fertilizo
Dolomite as a mineral has very few uses. However, dolostone has an enormous number of uses because it occurs in deposits that are large enough to mine. The most common use for dolostone is in the construction industry. It is crushed and sized for use as a road base material, an aggregate in concrete and asphalt, railroad ballast, rip-rap, or fill.

Notes. Dolomite as a ceramic material is a uniform calcium magnesium carbonate. In ceramic glazes, it is used as a source of magnesia and calcia. Other than talc, dolomite is the principal source of MgO in high-temperature raw glazes. 'Dolomite matte' stoneware glazes, for example, are highly prized for their pleasant 'silky' surface texture. Dolomite by itself is refractory, but when combined

Dolomite is a magnesium ore with the general formula MgCO 3 CaCO 3. The use of dolomite as a catalyst in biomass gasification has attracted much attention (Xu, Donald, Byambajav, & Ohtsuka, 2010). The chemical composition of dolomite varies from source to source, but it generally contains 30 wt.% CaO, 21 wt.% MgO, and 45 wt.% CO 2.
