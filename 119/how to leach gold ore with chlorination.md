## Slag
Slag is a by-product of smelting (pyrometallurgical) ores and used metals. Broadly, it can be classified as ferrous (by-products of processing iron and steel), ferroalloy (by-product of ferroalloy production) or non-ferrous/base metals (by-products of recovering non-ferrous materials like copper, nickel, zinc and phosphorus). Within these general categories, slags can be further categorized by

A gold recovery process is disclosed in which the gold content of ores, including carbonaceous ores or mixtures of carbonaceous and oxide ores, is extracted by a simultaneous chlorine leach and ion exchange resin adsorption procedure. The process eliminates or reduces the degree of oxygenation and cyanidation required to conduct a standard gold extraction process.

## Newbery-Vautin chlorination process
The Newbery-Vautin chlorination process is a process to extract gold from its ore using chlorination and was developed by James Cosmo Newbery and Claude Vautin.. Background. The extraction and reduction of gold from ores via its absorption in chlorine gas is a well-known process. It was first introduced by Karl Friedrich Plattner around 1848, and at that time promised to revolutionize gold

Make up a leach solution of HCl at pH 3 to 4, this is your operating range. The pH will always rise during the process so you need to add very small amounts of HCl to keep the pH in the range. Add straight common salt to the leach to reach 4% salt in solution. The salt speeds up the leach reaction, it is not necessary to have it but is a good idea.

Due to formation of CaOCl + complex in solution and hence less reactivity, calcium hypochlorite produces a sluggish gold leaching kinetics, taking twice the time (46 h) to achieve maximum gold recovery of 58% compared to sodium hypochlorite. 10 g/L of total initial hypochlorite species in solution produces reasonable gold recoveries. The amount of added HCl and hence the initial pH was found to have a major effect on gold leaching kinetics and maximum gold recovery.
