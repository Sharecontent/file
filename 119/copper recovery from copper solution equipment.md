Steel pots as Gold Recovery Equipment: we need so many equipment for gold recovery. If you are going to recycle ic chips this steel pot is the main equipment. Many people buy steel pot from the market and when they use those steel pots. Acid eats steel pot. Its main reason is that steel has different qualities and grades.

Since then the technique has been applied to the recovery of the rarer metals including columbium, tantalum, and rare earths. In the early 1960's General Mills Chemicals, Inc. developed a solvent designated LIX 63, for the extraction of copper from splutions of pH greater than 4.0. It was thus very suitable for treating the product from the

## Etchant Regeneration and Copper Recovery System - Cemco
Spent solution is normally precipitated as Copper Oxide and discarded for landfill. The original proposal for recovering the copper in a high quality form came from EA Technology Ltd. Using an electrolytic technique involving a divided cell, simultaneous regeneration of the etching solution and recovery of the unwanted Copper is made possible.

## Selective recovery of chromium, copper, nickel, and zinc from an acid 
The strategy developed consisted of recovering copper (97.6%), as a metal, by electrolyzing the solution at a controlled potential. Then, the simultaneous alkalinization of the solution (pH 14), addition of H(2)O(2), and heating of the solution led to a complete oxidation of chromium and nickel recovery (87.9% as a precipitate of nickel hydroxide).

2 Hydrometallurgy is the recovery of metaIs from ores using water-based solutions. As early as 6000 B. C., native copper-the pure metal—was foundas reddish stones in the Med- iterranean area and hammered into utensils, weapons, and tools. Around 5000 B. C., artisans discovered that heat made copper more malle-able.

A soluble chloride is added to the sulphate solution of copper and the proper amount of sulphurous acid is added. Moderate heat under pressure—90° C. of heat—precipitated almost all the copper as sub-chloride. The subsequent process of obtaining the copper without volatilization and the recovery of the chlorine offered difficulties.

## Recovery of copper values from copper ores - Hydromet Systems L. L. C.
Copper values are efficiently recovered from a copper ore, including secondary sulfides, by first crushing the ore to a particle size P-80 of about 1 to 2 inches, then grinding the so crushed ore to a particle size P-80 of between Tyler 4 mesh and 20 mesh, and then classifying the ground ore into a fines fraction of less than 65 mesh and one or more coarse fractions of more than 65 mesh.

4. There are three reasons why the UPS Selector indicates longer run time. First, past APC literature had less accurate information regarding equipment power draw and consistently overstated the power draw of load equipment. Second, many types of computer equipment consume less power than they did a few years ago so typical systems run longer.

## Minerals | Free Full-Text | Study of Reagent Scheme, Entrainment and 
Entrainment has been considered as an important factor affecting clayey ore flotation. In this study, the effect of reagent dosage on chalcopyrite flotation in the presence of bentonite and kaolinite was investigated through entrainment. It was found that increasing the collector and frother dosage had little influence on copper recovery in the presence of bentonite, but decreased the copper

## Copper and Antimony Recovery from Electronic Waste by  - PubMed
A strategy for the efficient recovery of highly pure copper and antimony metals from electronic waste (e-waste) was implemented by the combination of hydrometallurgical and electrochemical processes. The focus is on copper recovery as the main component in the leached solution, whereas the antimony .
