Shearing is a kind of mechanical finish in which the appearance of the fabric is enhanced by cutting the loops or raised surface to a uniform and even height. The machine may have a spiral blade similar to a grass cutting machine. [17] [18] A Shearing machine can cut the loop or the pile to a desired level. [19] Peaching [ edit]

Shaper A shaper is a type of machine tool that uses linear relative motion between the work piece and a single-point cutting tool to machine a linear tool path. Its cut is analogous to that of a lathe, except that it is (archetypal) linear instead of helical. (Adding axes of motion can yield helical tool paths, as also done in helical planning.)

What is Shaping Machine? Shaping machine is a machine designed for giving desired shapes to the surfaces that may be horizontal, vertical and flat. A shaping tool is used to cut in curves, different angles, and many other shapes. A disc is responsible for the tool rotation which results in the forward and backward movement.

Al the operations done in planning machines can be done in the shaping machine.Planer Machine Introduction The principle of the planner machine is the concept of relative tool-work motions. Reciprocation of the tool or job and the slow, intermittent transverse feed motions are imparted to the job or tool by the fast straight path cutting motion.

13.1 Introduction. A shaper is a machine tool that uses reciprocating straight line motion of the tool and a perpendicular feed of the job or the tool. By moving the work piece across the path of the reciprocating tool a flat surface is generated regardless of the shape of the tool. With special tools, attachments and devices for holding the work, a shaper can also be used to cut external and internal key ways, gears, racks, dovetails, T-slots and other miscellaneous shapes.

The Shaper Machine tool used for shaping operation is called shaper. Designed for machining flat surfaces on small sized jobs.If the size of the job is large, then planing isused. In a shaper, the work piece is held stationary during cutting, while the tool reciprocates horizontally. the feed and depth of cut are normally provided by moving the work.
