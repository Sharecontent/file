More specifically, mining is used to extract non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, minerals and even water. There are four main methods of mining: underground, surface, placer and in-situ. The type of mining method used depends on the kind of resource that is being targeted for extraction, the deposit's location below or on the Earth's

Mining is required to supply shale to the retorts of aboveground processes. The majority of oil shale mining is expected to be by the underground room-and-pillar method. Surface mining (i.e., open pit mining) may also be used to supply material for surface retorts and may be appropriate for up to 15 to 20% of the oil shale resources.

2. Mining Methods • Coal is mined by two main methods - surface or 'opencast' mining and 'underground' mining. • The choice of method is largely determined by the depth, geology of the coal deposit and other factors. • The majority of the world's coal production is coming from Opencast mines. • This scenario is same in India also.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.

Surface mining is defined as the extraction of ore from an open pit or burrow. Surface mining is sometimes known as open-pit, open-cut or open-cast mining and is only commercially viable if the deposit is located relative close to the surface. Less than 20% of Alberta's bitumen reserves are close enough to the surface to be mined.
