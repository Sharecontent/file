## History of Diamonds | Cape Town Diamond Museum
Diamond Mining | Famous Diamonds | Diamonds Through The Ages. The story of diamonds in South Africa begins between December 1866 and February 1867 when 15-year-old Erasmus Jacobs found a transparent rock on his father's farm, on the south bank of the Orange River.

By 1869, diamonds were found far from any stream or river.
