## What are the advantages and disadvantages of using Fly ash in Concrete 
It can add greater strength to the building. The concrete mixture generates a very low heat of hydration which prevents thermal cracking. Fly Ash concrete is resistant to acid and sulphate attacks. The shrinkage of fly ash concrete is very less. The use of fly ash gives concrete good work ability, durability and finish.
