##  Lime Production: Industry Profile - US EPA
Limestone can be categorized as either high calcium or dolomitic. Pure high-calcium limestone is 100 percent calcium carbonate (100 percent calcite or aragonite). Generally, limestone of this purity does not occur naturally. High-quality, high-calcium limestone would actually contain 97 to 99 percent calcium carbonate and 1 to 3 percent impurities.
