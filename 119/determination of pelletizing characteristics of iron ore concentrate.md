## Analysis of iron ore pellets properties concerning raw material 
Mar 1, 2022The properties of pellets coming under Range-I (slimes added ≤20%) are similar to the pellet properties of high-grade iron ore with zero slime. In contrast, the Range-II (slimes added 20-40%) pellet is moderately acceptable by blending with high-grade calibrated ores or pellets/sinter for the production of iron.

## Iron Ore Concentrate Particle Size Controlling Through Application of 
Pelletizing is one of the most efficient processes to prepare fine iron ore to reduction reactors. Its flexibility to adjust pellet composition for each operation (tailored-made) and the uniformity/stability of size distribution, chemical composition, and physical and metallurgical properties are key factors to a reactor's stable operation.
