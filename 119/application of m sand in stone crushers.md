## 7 Types of Stone Crusher and How to Choose the Best?
Sep 23, 2021The work of the impact sand making machine is continuous. It uses high-speed moving materials to strike iron, strike each other and friction between the materials to break. There are two crushing methods: "stone-on-rock" and "stone-on-iron". Application: "Stone-on-Stone" is suitable for abrasive materials with medium-hardness and above.
