## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.

## Grinding machine
A grinding machine, often shortened to grinder, is a power tool (or machine tool) used for grinding.It is a type of machining using an abrasive wheel as the cutting tool.Each grain of abrasive on the wheel's surface cuts a small chip from the workpiece via shear deformation.. Grinding is used to finish workpieces that must show high surface quality (e.g., low surface roughness) and high

Centerless grinding is an OD (outer diameter) grinding process. Unique from other cylindrical processes, where the workpiece is held in the grinding machine while grinding between centers, the workpiece is not mechanically constrained during centerless grinding. Therefore the parts to be ground on a centerless grinder do not need center holes
