5 days agoThe answer is the cement industry. Limestone plays two major roles in the cement manufacturing process, one is used as a raw material for cement clinker, and the other is used as a cement admixture. Limestone is one of the key raw materials of cement clinker. Around 80-90% of the raw material for the kiln feed is limestone.
