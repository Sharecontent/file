## Manganese Ore Processing High Grade
Jan 28, 2020 MANGANESE 0RE High grade metallurgical manganese ore is generally smelted and refined to produce ferromanganese, an alloy which has long been used in the processing of steel.Just as the main downstream use of ferrochrome is stainless steel. ferromanganese is beneficiated as carbon steel.

Move over lithium, graphite, cobalt and copper: manganese is fast emerging as the next battery metal story to titillate investors. The back story is similar: with manganese usage dominated by China and supply emanating from largely unattractive or unreliable geographies, western world car and batter makers are desperate to get their paws on the processed high-grade material.

A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing (a low grade) manganese ore in a heap leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850 °C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide

Oxidizing filters can be used with ferrous or ferric iron, and manganous or manganic manganese. The minimum pH is 7.0. A pH of 8.0 is needed when the manganese concentration is high.

## 8 Types of Gold Ore- Properties and Ways to Process
1 Wash, filter and grind the granite ore with into smaller pieces. 2 Put the ground ore into a tank containing a dilute cyanide solution and add zinc. The chemical reaction between a dilute cyanide solution and zinc will separate the gold from the ore. 3 Use a filter press to remove the gold from the solution.

## Development of a Smelting Reduction Process for Low-Grade Ferruginous 
Manganese alloys are important raw materials for steelmaking. However, selective mining of high-grade manganese ore resources has resulted in a scarcity of these high-grade Mn ores (Mn: >42; Mn/Fe: >5). The present research work is carried out to explore a new smelting reduction process to produce high-Mn/Fe synthetic Mn ore from low-grade ferruginous manganese ores. Representative samples of
