In the past, rock phosphate was used to supercharge inorganic fertilisers like superphosphate — this is what most of the Australian miners are aiming their production for. To use the 'organic' raw form, poses a few problems. Phosphorus, the element, is not easy for plants to extract from soil generally and they take up between 5-20 per cent.
