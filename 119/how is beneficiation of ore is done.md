## Characterization and Beneficiation of Dry Iron Ore Processing Plant 
Iron ore is the basic raw material for iron and steel making. India is among the leading producers of iron ore in the world and produces about 150 million tons per annum (U. S. []).The total reserves of iron ore in India is around 28.5 billion tons, of this hematite ore is considered to be the most important iron ore because of its high grade quality and lumpy nature.

At the same time, it has the characteristics of fine disseminated particle size and close symbiosis of iron and manganese minerals, so it is difficult to recover by mechanical beneficiation.

Magnetite ore concentrate gets re-converted into hematite ore in the pelletisation, as it is an oxidation process. The hardening of pellets can be done by the vertical shaft kiln or travelling grate furnace cum rotary kiln. The vertical shaft kiln needs lower investments &is suitable for small capacities of 100,000 tons to 600,000 tons per year.
