Tin ores that contain high sulphide mineral contents have to undergo an additional process, whereby the ore is baked at °C to burn the sulphur. Flotation is not as efficient for tin as it is for sulphide ores, it is becoming more frequently used to improve the amount of tin recovered from both primary ores and reprocessing to recover

However, the tin concentrate grade of 40% is required, meaning the enrichment of hundreds or thousands times. Targeting at the refractory tin ore, low grade tin concentrate is obtained and it has to be further extracted by special metallurgy process. Reduction smelting is the dominant process to extract tin metal from tin concentrate.

## mining process for tin metal
The principle of tin smelting is the chemical reduction of tin oxide by heating with carbon to produce tin metal and carbon dioxide gas. In practice, the furnace feed contains the tin oxide concentrate, carbon in the form of anthracite coal or coke, and limestone to act as a flux and a slag-producing agent.

## Tin
Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (from Latin: stannum) and atomic number 50. Tin is a silvery-coloured metal. Tin is soft enough to be cut with little force and a bar of tin can be bent by hand with little effort. When bent, the so-called "tin cry" can be heard as a result of twinning in tin crystals; this trait is shared by indium, cadmium, zinc, and mercury in the solid state.
