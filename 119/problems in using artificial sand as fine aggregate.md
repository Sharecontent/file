Replacement of fine aggregate with plastic in concrete. the effects of using plastic waste as an alternative of Fine Aggregate. Disposal of plastic waste in the environment is considered to be a big problem due to the rapid growth of population in countries like India the disposing of solid waste is a major problem in our daily life.

In addition, replacing fine silica sand (around 950 HKD/metric ton in Hong Kong) by artificial fine aggregates (around 550 HKD/metric ton in this study) can reduce the cost and improve the sustainability of ECC. Thus, it is worth exploring the use of artificial fine aggregates in the ECC materials.

## artificial sand as fine aggregates
The fine aggregate particles are between 0.16 and 5 mm in diameter. Natural sand, such as river sand, sea sand and valley sand, is generally used. When natural sand is lacking, artificial sand ground with a hard rock can also be used; The coarse aggregate particles are larger than 5 mm in diameter. Crushed stone and pebbles are commonly used.

## Fine Aggregates: Types, Properties & Uses in construction
Bulging is a phenomenon that causes the aggregates to swell by absorbing moisture from the humid air. The concrete mix design may be inaccurate and enough additional sand is always added to compensate for this swelling when this bulk sand will return to normal state. 12.Bulb Density:

Artificial sand has slightly less solid properties than natural sand, but still meets the standard for use. There is no problem in the use of ordinary concrete. However, if it is used in concrete members that are often subjected to frictional impact, in addition to admixtures, the lime-sand ratio of concrete, the crushing index of sand and the

How fine aggregate affects concrete mix design. Fine aggregate testing is a concoction of various materials which are distributed, refined, and picked after going through thorough analysis through a sieve test. The aggregate must have the right proportion of course and fine agglomeration, for it to be considered fit for use in construction.

## Manufactured Sand vs. Natural Sand - Chaney Enterprises
The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical. Spherical particles decrease the percentage of voids within the concrete mixture so no additional paste is required to fill these voids.
