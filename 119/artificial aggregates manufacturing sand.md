## The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand - The Screed Scientist®
The Manufacturing Process. Rocks or quarry stones are blasted and subjected to a series of crushing cycles to reduce the particles to the size of naturally occurring sand.  Manufactured sand can be used as aggregates in screed and concrete mixes, as per EN13139. It can be used as a replacement or as a blended mixture with natural sand.

4.) Flaky Aggregates - The aggregate is said to be flaky when the least dimension of aggregate is less than 3/5th (or 60%) of its mean dimension. Mean dimension is the average size through which the particles pass and the sieve size on which these are retained. For example, mean size of the particles passing through 20 mm sieve and retained on 16 mm sieve is (20+16)/2=18 mm.

The choice of fine aggregate, whether it is manufactured or natural sand, can greatly impact the fresh concrete properties of a mixture such as the workability, pumpability, and finishability. Natural sand has an ideal shape for use as fine aggregate in concrete. The natural sand particles are well-rounded and are usually nearly spherical.
