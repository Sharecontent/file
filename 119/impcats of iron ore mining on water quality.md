## Impact of Iron Ore Mining on Water Quality - ethesis
Mining operations require water for their functioning directly and indirectly. Since a long time mining industry has been exploiting water without realizing the adverse impact it is having on the environment and the regional ecosystem. Acid mine drainage has become a major concern associated with mining. Water contamination has caused spread of many diseases and has caused loss of life.

## Iron ore | BHP
There are four main types of iron ore deposit: massive hematite, which is the most commonly mined, magnetite, titanomagnetite, and pisolitic ironstone. These ores vary in colour from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. Iron is responsible for the red colour in many of our rocks and the deep red sands of the Australian deserts.
