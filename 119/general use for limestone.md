## General purpose cement with increased limestone content in Australia
This paper discusses the effects of an increase in the maximum allowable limestone content of general purpose (GP) cement from 7.5 up to 12%. The substitution of a higher content of clinker with limestone will allow for a lower embodied energy and emissions associated with the manufacture of GP cement. Fresh and hardened

The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash.

## The Many Uses For Limestone Gravel - Homedit
Limestone is a sedimentary rock. When you use pulverized limestone, it serves as a catalyst for bacterial soil activity and creates stronger soil. It also assists with compost disintegration. When this happens, the soil becomes more porous, making it possible for more air to circulate through it and store essential water nutrients.
