What makes concrete so strong is the chemical reaction that occurs when cement and water mix â€” a process known as hydration. "Hydration occurs when cement and water react," says Ulm. "During hydration, the clinker dissolves into the calcium and recombines with water and silica to form calcium silica hydrates."
