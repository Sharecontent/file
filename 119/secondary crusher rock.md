## Crushers: Breaking Down the History of these Machines
A gyratory crusher was patented by Philetus W. Gates in 1881. Thomas A. Edison also designed a rock crusher to use in his own mining operation. Edison's design used giant rolls to function as a primary crusher. These machines never gained much popularity though because the gyratory and jaw crushers were more versatile.
