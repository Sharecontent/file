## Wind Energy | National Geographic Society
Anything that moves has kinetic energy, and scientists and engineers are using the wind's kinetic energy to generate electricity. Wind energy, or wind power, is created using a wind turbine, a device that channels the power of the wind to generate electricity.. The wind blows the blades of the turbine, which are attached to a rotor.The rotor then spins a generator to create electricity.

Globally, wind energy has a capacity of 743GW and produces over 5% of global electricity. However, wind power production and electricity output are highly dependent on many factors, including wind speed

## How Much Power Does a Wind Turbine Generate? | Sciencing
Just because a wind turbine has a capacity rating of 1.5 megawatts, that doesn't mean it will produce that much power in practice. Wind turbines commonly produce considerably less than rated capacity, which is the maximum amount of power it could produce if it ran all the time. For example, a 1.5-megawatt wind turbine with an efficiency factor

Betz Limit in wind power extraction. In 1919, Albert Betz, a German physicist, made a discovery on the efficiency of wind turbines. They can't convert more than 59.3% of the wind's kinetic energy into mechanical energy. So, the power efficiency of wind turbines has a limit.

National Wind Watch. In a line of several turbines perpendicular to the wind (as on a mountain ridge), the GE 1.5-MW model would need at least 32 acres and the Vestas V90 78 acres for each tower. In an array that can take advantage of the wind from any direction, the GE needs 82 acres and the Vestas V90 111 acres per tower.

A Residential wind turbine is manufactured on a smaller scale than the commercial types and can range in diameter from 7 to 25. Based on their tested wind speeds, they can easily produce anywhere from 900 to 1,000 watts of. Small wind turbines used in residential applications typically range in size from 400 watts to 20 kilowatts, depending on the amount of electricity you want to generate.
