## Magnetic resonance ore sorting - International Mining
By using magnetic resonance radio waves NextOre's solution not only penetrates all of the ore presented on the conveyor, but reads the different mineral radio signals, informing sorters what is present in seconds. Miljak adds that it is extremely effective at detecting levels of arsenic that often occur along with gold orebodies.

The most efficient way that most people use is panning or a similar concept, where water is used to push lighter material to one side, while the heavier (gold) material gathers at a lower point in the vesicle. METAL DETECTORS used for gold prospecting emit a strong magnetic field, and briefly magnetize gold nuggets below the surface.

## Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury
Jan 12, 2022In many countries, elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, forming a mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process can be very dangerous and lead to significant mercury exposure and health risks.

## Can magnetic exploration directly detect gold?f
The magnetic method is espe- cially effective for mapping gold deposits as they mostly occur in volcanic rocks with high magnetiza- tion, which makes the quiet zones more distinct (Allis, 1990).  Magnetic gradiometry is also an important near-surface exploration method in the investigation of gold and silver deposits.

## Can a Magnetometer Detect Gold? - Geometrics : Geometrics
Where there is gold there is often magnetite and therefore the magnetometer can be used to locate placer gold deposits. Gold treasure is a different story and being non-magnetic gold, silver, and other precious minerals are not directly detectable by the magnetometer. 2. The magnetometer can only detect ferrous (iron or steel) objects.
