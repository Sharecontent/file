## Pad: Concrete Or Crushed Stone? - Pool and Spa Forum
I bought the pavers myself from a local wholesaler and brought them to the site in my truck. That saved a lot by itself. The site prep was done by a local landscaper, which included raising and leveling off the area around the patio, digging down a foot and adding crushed stone and a thick layer of compacted stone dust.
