## Thin seam mining - SlideShare
Thin seam mining. 1. THIN SEAM MINING The definition of thin seam varies considerably against coal mining countries. There are, however, fairly well defined minimum thickness in which equipment can work. Underground mining of thin seam has invariably been more difficult, hazardous and costly process than working of thicker seam.

Coal seams in Appalachia typically contain non-coal materials that lay within, above or below the coal seam. This material is mined along with the coal in underground mining and is mechanically separated from the coal at the preparation plant. The leftover material is placed in an adjacent refuse fill or impoundment.

Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

In underground coal mining, the working environment is completely enclosed by the geologic medium, which consists of the coal seam and the overlying and underlying strata. Access to the coal seam is gained by suitable openings from the surface, and a network of roadways driven in the seam then facilitates the installation of service facilities for such essential activities as human and

Coal mine gas (firedamp) is a problematic phenomenon associated with coal mining, as the gas can form explosive mixtures together with air. The main component of the primary coal seam gas is methane in a concentration of 90-95 % the gas develops during the geochemical conversion of organic substances to coal (carbonisation).

Shaft mines are the deepest mines; a vertical shaft with an elevator is made from the surface down to the coal. In western Kentucky, one shaft mine reaches 1,200 feet below the surface. In room and pillar mining, the most common type of underground coal mining, coal seams are mined by a continuous miner that cuts a network of "rooms" into the seam.

## Australian Fugitive Methane Reduction: a case study for coal mining
In the coal mining context, methane from coal seams can escape during the mining processes of both underground and open cut operations. Methane naturally occurs within coal seams after being trapped during their formation. Deep coal deposits are formed with high temperature and high pressure, and therefore produce greater volumes of gas.

For example some western U.S. coal that occur at depths in excess of 60 m (200 ft) are mined by the open pit methods due to thickness of the seam 20-25 metres (60-90 feet).
