Rock dust is a byproduct of the quarrying industry and results from rock crushing. In the industry it is known as blue metal, cracker or crusher dust. Landscapers use rock dust for filling holes, bedding paving stones and mixing with cement. More recently its applications have broadened to other areas and its true importance is becoming apparent.

There are many downsides to using unstabilized decomposed granite for a driveway. Without proper stabilization, it is not quite as permeable. It will still drain liquid, but at a much slower rate than if the driveway were to be excavated and stabilized with pavers. Also, it actually encourages weed growth if laid over plain grass.

## Basalt Rock - Formation, Properties, Uses, Construction and FAQs - VEDANTU
Basalt is an extrusive igneous or volcanic rock that has a low silica content, dark in colour, and is very rich in iron and magnesium. Basalt rock is mainly composed of pyroxene, olivine, and plagioclase and is the most common rock on the earth's surface. The texture of basalt rocks is coarsely porous as those holes are left by gas bubbles.
