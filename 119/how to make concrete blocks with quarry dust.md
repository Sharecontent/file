To mix the concrete you should spread the sand out on a concrete slab or a steel plate. The sand must be 5cm to 10cm thick. Spread the cement over the sand and add aggregates. Use a shovel to mix the sand and cement until a uniform colour is achieved. Sprinkle water over the surface of the mixture.
