## A review on use of limestone powder in cement-based materials 
Limestone powder (LS) has been widely used in cement-based materials; and reportedly, can influence their properties by filler, nucleation, dilution and chemical effects. The action mechanism of LS mainly depends on its particle size and amount. The filler effect of LS refines the microstructure and reduces the porosity of cement-based materials.
