## Impact on the Environment | Museum of Industry
Gold-bearing rocks in Nova Scotia contain high amounts of a mineral called arsenopyrite, which bears arsenic. Tailings - sand-sized particles left over after the gold-bearing ore was crushed in a stamp mill - further concentrated the already abundant natural arsenic. Arsenic causes a host of health issues for humans and wildlife.

Gold was mined in 64 districts in southern Nova Scotia between 1861 and the early 1940s, followed by limited, intermittent production up to the present. There is extensive dispersion of arsenic- and mercury-bearing mine tailings in the receiving environment downstream from many of these sites.

## Biological effects of gold mine tailings on the intertidal marine 
From 1861 to the 1940s, gold was produced from 64 mining districts in Nova Scotia, where mercury amalgamation was the dominant method for the extraction of gold from ore until the 1880s. As a result, wastes (tailings) from the milling process were contaminated by mercury and were high in naturally occurring arsenic.

## Nova Scotia's golden addiction to toxic mining - The Coast
Especially after machinery came into use, gold mining was a wasteful enterprise. Through the first three gold rushes, Nova Scotia produced over 37 tonnes of gold and over 3,000,000 tonnes of tailings. If you put the tailings on a scale, you would need 30,000 blue whales to balance it. As for the gold, one third of one whale would balance.
