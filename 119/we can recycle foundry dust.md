## Sand Pump and Transport System for Reuse of Foundry Sand
Sand Pump & System for Reuse of Foundry Sand 2. In a project designed to reclaim and reuse foundry sand, a Pennsylvania foundry required two reliable and efficient sand transport systems. The objective was to reduce operational costs by creating a mixture of new and reclaimed foundry sand for molding, while lowering waste disposal requirements.

Scrap aluminum gets $1367 per ton, as compared to plastic that only gets $310, and glass actually gets $0 per ton. Cans are also getting lighter, while continuing to stay durable. This leads to better efficiency for shipping, and eventually less waste. Aluminum can recycling has grown consistently since the early 2000's.

Non-metallic foundry waste is generally composed of spent green sand, core sand, and dust collected in the ventilation bag-house systems of the foundry facility. Currently, practices exist for the recovery of sand particles from green sand and core sand at the expense of the other constituents via consumption or degradation.

It can be handled similarly to solid scrap and results in a higher yield and less slag in the smelter in comparison to the direct recirculation of powders. For foundries, these innovative recycling methods can add great value. Hazardous waste is turned into high-quality raw materials, either as toll treatment or as a disposal service.

In this work, a compromise method was proposed to solve this problem. First, MOC is used to recycle foundry dust (FD). The traditional method is to use PC to recycle FD.

## Dust Collectors for Foundry Applications - Imperial Systems
Foundry dust collection may involve special challenges, like high temperatures and a heavy dust load. Also, foundries often have both sand and metal dust to deal with. In the typical foundry process, molds are made of sand or another material. Metal is poured into these molds. After cooling and breaking the mold, the foundry reclaims the sand.

The recycling of non-hazardous, spent foundry sand can save energy, reduce the need to mine virgin materials and may reduce costs for both producers and end users of foundry sand. Recycled foundry sand typically finds use in construction applications but can also be used in the following ways: Feedstock for the manufacturing of Portland cement
