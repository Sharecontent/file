## Geology, Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits
The largest ore concentration is found in banded sedimentary iron formations of Precambrian age. These formations constitute the bulk of iron ore resources of the world. Iron ores occur in a wide variety of geological environments in igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rocks, or as weathering products of various primary iron bearing materials.

Sedimentary rocks are formed by the deposition and subsequent cementation of the material at the Earth's surface within the bodies of water. These rocks are formed in four ways: Deposition of weathered remains of other rocks Accumulation and the consolidation of sediments Deposition of the results of biogenic activity Precipitation from solution.

## Iron ore
Iron ores are rocks and minerals from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. The ores are usually rich in iron oxides and vary in color from dark grey, bright yellow, or deep purple to rusty red. The iron is usually found in the form of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4, 72.4% Fe), hematite (Fe 2 O 3, 69.9% Fe), goethite (FeO(OH), 62.9% Fe), limonite (FeO(OH)·n(H 2 O), 55% Fe) or siderite (FeCO

Abstract. The sedimentary iron-formations of Precambrian age in the Lake Superior region can be divided on the basis of the dominant original iron mineral into four principal facies: sulfide, carbonate, oxide, and silicate.
