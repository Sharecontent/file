## Frac Sand Health and Environmental Impacts - Earthworks
The sand keeps the cracks propped open so that oil and gas are released. Frac sand mining creates significant air pollution from the handling, mining, and processing of the sand. The important sources of air emissions come from the tiny dust particles - known as particulate matter - scattered during mining and processing.

Increased turbidity in water causes environmental consequences such as reduction in ecological productivity, habitat quality, faster filling of lakes and affects the colour of the water. The particles make the water absorb heat from the sunlight, resulting in the reduction of oxygen concentration in the water.

## Mining: Frac sand - Wisconsin Geological & Natural History Survey
What is frac sand? Frac sand is quartz sand of a specific grain size and shape that is suspended in fluid and injected into oil and gas wells under very high pressure. The fluid pressure opens and enlarges fractures as well as creates new ones. Sand grains are carried into these fractures and prop them open after the fluid is pumped out.

## Causes of Turbidity in Water & How to Reduce It - AOS
Why Is Turbidity Important? Turbidity may increase due to rain, erosion and plant and animal life in the water. However, the importance of turbidity in water treatment increases when the sand, silt, and organic matter remain in the drinking water in a community. Turbidity and water quality have a considerable impact on local communities.

Wet sand is instead loaded straight from decanting piles. The gas-burning dryers are left off. Chesapeake's numbers show that by using wet sand instead of dry sand, the operator saves about $11/ton. On a 10,000-ft lateral using 3,600 lb/ft, this translates to a savings of nearly $200,000, or 2% off the total well cost.

Many samples are turbid and colored. The more intensive the color is, the more light is absorbed and the turbidity appears to be higher than it is. That is why the real turbidity is measured as scattered light, e.g. at an angle at 90° where just particles scatter the light beam, without any influence of coloration.
