## What are the advantages of quarry dust used in the concrete, a  - Quora
Answer (1 of 4): I'm not an authority on this subject, but here are some thoughts. That depends upon what the quarry dust is. If it has minerals that will react with the cement you could get a faster or slower set time. Also, since quarry dust is quite fine, you should have a denser concrete. Hig

## Strength Characteristics of Quarry Dust in Replacement of Sand
Abstract. The replacement of natural fine aggregate by using quarry dust leads to consumption of generated quarry dust, the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and solves the natural sand scarcity problem. The sand availability as a fine aggregate at low cost which needs the reason to search as a alternative material.

Concrete slabs can develop voids from a variety of reasons, ranging from sliding soil beneath the slab displaced because of a lack of proper compression, to water erosion slowly washing away the soil over time. Voids can lead to a weakness in the slab, causing dips in the surface, tilting or cracks and breaks.
