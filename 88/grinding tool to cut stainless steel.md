The Doc Replies: Stainless is more difficult to grind than hardened steel primarily for two reasons: lower thermal conductivity and a nasty chemical reaction. First, stainless steel, such as 304 or 316, has about half the thermal conductivity of, say, 52100 steel. That means 52100 sucks away the heat generated during grinding more quickly, reducing surface temperatures.
