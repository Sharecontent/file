## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## How to Understand Aggregate Production Planning  - Independent Research
Aggregate production planning and aggregate resources are tricky, whether the "standard" SAP functionality is leveraged, or something custom is written. However, I took a step back on this requirement and concluded that it is not necessary. It is needed to explain better how SNP/CTM and PP/DS work independently and how they work in conjunction.

INTRODUCTION. This unit deals with the concept of 'Aggregate Planning', which is an operational activity which does an aggregate plan for the production process, in advance of 3 to 18 months, to give an idea to management as to what quantity of materials and other resources are to be procured and when, so that the total cost of operations of the organisation is kept to the minimum over

If the coarse aggregate has a moisture content of 1.5% we will instead need to batch about 1946 pounds of coarse aggregate per cubic yard of concrete (1917 lb/yd3  1.015 = 1946 lb/yd3).
