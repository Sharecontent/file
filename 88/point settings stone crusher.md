The optimum speed of gyration and the large eccentric throw produce two important results: 1) the rapidly closing head catches the falling feed material and delivers the extremely high crushing force and 2) on the other side of the chamber the rapidly receding head allows material to fall freely to the next point of impact or exit the chamber.

It is used wide open (150mm opening) for crushing large pieces of rock down to a smaller size - about 25-40mm. When crushing stone or rubble to a small size (i.e. below 16mm) it will be done in two or more stages for maximum production. The Swing Jaw setting is normally set on the bottom hole which gives the most movement back and forth.

Especially grade level cement. Especially in a climate with winters like ours in Pennsylvania. A worse way to go about it would be to lay the flagstone upon a bed of gravel and then cement the joints between stones. Horrible idea.
