## The working principle and performance of impact crusher
Impact crusher is a kind of equipment that uses impact energy to crush materials. When the machine is working, driven by the motor, the rotor rotates at a high speed. It is thrown to the counterattack equipment to be broken again, and then bounced from the counterattack liner to the action of the blow hammer to be crushed again.
