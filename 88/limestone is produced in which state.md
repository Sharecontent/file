Lime is a mineral made by heating limestone or dolomite in a kiln. Lime is used in a variety of chemical industries, in sugar processing plants, in steel mills, sewage treatment plants, and at paper mills. "Burned" or kilned limestone was also used as plaster and mortar in the homes of early settlers, and even into the mid-20th century.

Limestone is a very common sedimentary rock consisting of calcium carbonate (more than 50%). It is the most common non-siliciclastic (sandstone and shale are common siliciclastic rocks) sedimentary rock.Limestones are rocks that are composed of mostly calcium carbonate (minerals calcite or aragonite). Carbonate rocks where the dominant carbonate is dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) are

## Mining the Limestone - Two Praries, One Place
The burned oyster shells produced lime which was the binding agent or mortar in "tabby.". Lime was produced locally in Kasota by the calcination or burning of limestone at a very high temperature in a kiln. As far as I know, no "sticky rice" was added. There is at least one remnant of a lime kiln on the Kasota Prairie.

## Lime Statistics and Information | U.S. Geological Survey
Lime is an important chemical with numerous chemical, industrial, and environmental uses in the United States. It was primarily a construction commodity until the rapid growth of the chemical process industries at the beginning of the 20th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, more than 80% of the lime consumed in the United States

## Limestone - Formation, Composition, Types and Uses | Earth Eclipse
The limestone is mostly made up of one of two types of mineral - calcite or aragonite. Both of these are different crystal arrangements of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). All limestones contain at least 50% calcium carbonate by weight. Limestones also contain a considerable amount of magnesium carbonate (MgCO3), also known as dolomite.
