## Silica Brick - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Silica ceramic materials are mainly manufactured from pure quartzites and quartz (Brunk, 2000, 2001).Silica is used to manufacture "classical" silica bricks which are well known as refractory materials for some special applications. During the fabrication process, the crushed raw materials are pressed and fired at high temperature between 1400 and 1500°C.

Silica brick contains cristobalite, tridymite and some residual quartz. The crystal phases each have a high and low temperature forms which can transform reversibly.
