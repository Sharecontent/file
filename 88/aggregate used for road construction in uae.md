Here are 7 key points to keep in mind to make the best gravel road . 1. Understand Your Needs. Before construction begins, it is necessary to understand the needs and uses of the area where the road is going. Heavy industrial vehicles used for farming, for example, can wreak havoc on a gravel roadway if it is not strong enough, as the DOT exmplains.

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

Aggregates are the most basic material used in construction. They provide the foundation for roads, bridges, and buildings, while also making up over 90% of an asphalt pavement and up to 80% of a concrete mix. On average, 38,000 tons of aggregates are necessary to construct one lane mile of interstate highway.
