## What's the Difference Between Angiosperms and Gymnosperms?
The key difference between angiosperms and gymnosperms is how their seeds are developed. The seeds of angiosperms develop in the ovaries of flowers and are surrounded by a protective fruit. Flowers can be unisexual (e.g., male flowers and female flowers) or bisexual (the flower has both male and female parts).
