Materials almost free of platinum group metals are treated by the Wohlwill electrolytic process, which is widely used in major gold refineries, often in combination with the Miller process. Impure gold anodes are dissolved anodically in hydrochloric acid electrolyte, and 99.99% pure gold is deposited at the cathode.

## What Are the Methods for Gold Processing? - Mining-pedia
The content of gold in the ore is generally very low. In order to extract the gold, the ore needs to be crushed and ground to fine particles, and the gold needs to be pre-enriched by mineral processing or separated from the ore. The gold processing method commonly used in the production mainly includes the following: 1.

The process used to treat sulfide copper ores begins at the mine site, where the copper-bearing minerals are physically separated from the rest of the rock. The flow diagram below shows how the percentage of copper increases as the ore is refined, first physically by froth flotation, then chemically by smelting and finally electrolytic refining.
