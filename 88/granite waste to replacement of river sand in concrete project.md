## Utilization of Granite Slurry Waste in Concrete: A Review
Findings: It is shown that the granite slurry waste reduces the workability whereas compressive strength of granite concrete is improved when fine aggregate or cement is partially replaced. It has been also shown that the modified concrete performed well when level of F.A. by granite slurry waste is up to 15%.

## Waste plastic could replace sand used in concrete
Waste plastic could be used to partially replace sand in concrete to make construction more sustainable, according to research by the University of Bath. The research said it was possible to replace 10% of the sand in a concrete mix with waste plastic which had been ground down to similar sized granules as sand.

## Characteristic Studies on Concrete by Partial Replacement of  - IJERT
In present study the detailed characteristic studies of concrete is carried out by partial replacement of natural sand by waste granite powder in concrete composition with different percentages (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%).The mechanical properties of concrete like compressive strength, tensile strength are carried out by replacing the
