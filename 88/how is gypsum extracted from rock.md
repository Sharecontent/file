## How Granite is Extracted from the Earth - Engineering Specialists, Inc.
Extracting the Rock. Granite is usually formed into slabs or large deposits. There are different methods used by mining companies to cut and extract the deposits from the ground which are called quarries. When the granite is extracted, the mining team uses large equipment such as extractors and cranes to slowly dig around the deposits.

Gypsum, common sulfate mineral of superb industrial significance, composed of hydrated calcium sulfate (CaSO4 ·2H2O). In properly-developed crystals the mineral normally has been called selenite. The fibrous large variety has a silky lustre and is known as satin spar; it is translucent and opalescent and is valued for ornaments and jewellery.

Gypsum is considered both a sedimentary rock and a mineral. Its chemical formula is CaSO 4 ∙2H 2 O. Because gypsum formed when ancient seas evaporated in Oklahoma during Permian time ( million years ago), geologists classify it as an evaporite.Western Oklahoma has many large deposits of gypsum totaling trillions of tons (Figure 1).
