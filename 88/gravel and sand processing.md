A bark and bedding gravel mixture is dumped into a hopper and moves along an inclined vibratory conveyor onto a screening section which screens limbs and other large chunks of wood from the bark-and-gravel mixture as well as sand-sized particles. The limbs and wood chunks are reduced to chips and stored for later use. The sand is conveyed to an aggregate storage site for reuse as bedding material.
