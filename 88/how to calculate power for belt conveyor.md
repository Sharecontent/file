Oct 10, 2021So, the capacity of the conveyor in 5 minute is ( (505)/25)  2. ie, 20 nos. So the capacity of this particular conveyor is 20 parts in 5 minutes or it will move 1 part in 15 Seconds. Hence the formula for the conveyor capacity is, ( (conveyor speed  time)/ (length of part))  no of parts along width of conveyor.

## How to Calculate the Quantity of a Conveyor Belt on a Roll
Step 2. Determine the gauge, or thickness, of your conveyor belt. Belt gauges generally run from between 0.1 inches to 1.3 inches, depending of the application. You can either measure directly or ask your belt manufacturer for the belt specifications. For example, you might have a belt that is 0.5 inches thick.
