Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

## How can we use the crushers? - JINXIN CARBIDE
The cone crusher is driven by the motor to drive the pulley or the coupling, so that the drive shaft drives the eccentric sleeve to do a swinging motion. The crushing wall of the cone crusher sometimes approaches and sometimes leaves the rolling mortar wall, so that the ore is continuously impacted, squeezed and bent between the two to achieve
