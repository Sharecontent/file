P ower plants usually employ the use of different kinds of pumps for a wide range of operations. For instance, boiler feed pumps are crucial for the operation of power plants. These are typically used in different stages for the delivery of feedwater to boilers. The feedwater is then turned into steam, which is what turns the turbines generating power at the power plants.
