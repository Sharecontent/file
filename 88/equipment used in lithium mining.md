## Lithium Mining: The Environmental Cost is Toxic and Clear - unsustainable
Typically, lithium mining requires consuming large amounts of water, which could lead to draughts during summer months and floods during rainy seasons. Also, the chemical cocktails used to extract lithium from the ground could find its way into nearby streams, rivers, and water supply, thus posing a danger to wildlife and health.

## equipment used in lithium mining
Lithium Mining Pumps - EDDY Pump. Lithium is also a major component in the manufacture of batteries. In fact, over 50% of the lithium mined is used for the production of batteries, and with a rapid increase in lithium batteries used in electronic devices and lithium-ion battery-powered vehicles, lithium mining has become a major focus of mining.

## Lithium element extraction, mining technique- Acid treatment method
Lithium is historically known to be produced from two sources: brines and hard rock mining. Lithium produced from brines is a cost-efficient process. Also, Lithium is processed from brine, spodumene, and clay. Salar brines are underground reservoirs that contain high concentrations of dissolved salts, such as lithium, potassium, and sodium.

Lithium mining presents several potential complications on this front. The first is that of water.

## Study finds impact of Lithium Brine Mining depends on how old the water 
Lithium mining accounts for less than 10% of freshwater usage and its brine extraction does not correlate with changes in either surface-water features or basin-water storage. Lithium, says David Boutt, professor of geosciences at UMass Amherst and one of the paper's co-authors, is a strange element. It's the lightest of the metals, but it

Apr 13, 2022Although lithium can be found all over the United States, there is only one operating mine in the country: the Albemarle Silver Peak Mine in Nevada. This mine uses the brine extraction method to pull lithium deposits from under the earth's surface. The brine is usually found below the surface of dry lake beds and typically in deserts.

## Commercial Lithium Production and Mining of Lithium - ThoughtCo
By. Terence Bell. Updated on August 21, 2020. Most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene. Lithium production from clay sources is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.

## What's behind lithium mining? Here's all you need to know
The risks of lithium mining. Lack of water in the region is not just the single potential problem with lithium mining. Toxic chemicals can leak from the evaporation pools to the water supply, such as hydrochloric acid, which is used in the processing of lithium - as well as waste products that can filter out of the brine.
