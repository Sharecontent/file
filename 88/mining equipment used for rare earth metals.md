## How Rare-Earth Mining Has Devastated China's Environment
About 35% of the world's reserves of rare-earth metals are in China. China has built factories close to the mines, so that the raw material can quickly go into production. This increases efficiency and lowers production costs making it difficult for other countries to compete. In 2018, China produced 120 000 metric tons of total rare earths

## Rare Earth Elements Pose Environmental, Economic Risks for Clean Energy
However, when it comes to the actual quantity of rare earth elements used, the energy transition, specifically EVs and wind turbines, represent a much larger source of demand for rare earth elements than the military does.  Serpell: Yes, I think there are several traits of rare earth element mining and refining that are problematic. As we
