## Jaw Crusher Components & Parts - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Although the jaws do the work, the real heart of the jaw crusher and its components are the toggle plates, the pitman, and the ply wheel. These are the parts and components that generate the crushing action and provide the energy needed to break the ore. Let's follow the chain of events within a crushing cycle to see how they all go together.

For a jaw crusher the thickness of the largest particle should not normally exceed 80-85% of the gape. Assuming in this case the largest particle to be crushed is 85% of the gape, then the gape of the crusher should be = 45.7/0.85 = 53.6 cm and for a shape factor of 1.7, the width should be = 45.7 × 1.7 = 78 cm.

The working principle of the jaw crushers is very simple. Powered by a diesel or gas motor, the jaw crusher brakes materials in a crushing chamber. The materials are pushed inside the chamber from the top opening and when crushed they are released through the bottom opening. The crushing power of the jaw crushers depends on the size of the chamber.
