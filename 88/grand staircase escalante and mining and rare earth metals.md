Under the new federal management plan, much of Bears Ears and more than 1,000 square miles of the former Grand Staircase-Escalante monument are open to coal mining and oil-and-gas drilling. Other measures include allowing off-road vehicles in some areas for the first time, and permitting camping outside of what had been specially designated zones.
