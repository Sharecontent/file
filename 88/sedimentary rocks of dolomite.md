Sedimentary rocks of the McArthur Basin in Northern Australia provide one of the best windows on the chemistry of the Mesoproterozoic ocean.  Up to 40% of the measured sections of the Amelia Dolomite consists of such relics in the form of carbonate pseudomorphs after a variety of morphologies of gypsum and anhydrite crystals, chert

## Dolomite: A sedimentary rock known as dolostone or dolomite rock
Dolomite, also known as "dolostone" and "dolomite rock," is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of the mineral dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2. Dolomite is found in sedimentary basins worldwide. It is thought to form by the postdepositional alteration of lime mud and limestone by magnesium-rich groundwater. Dolomite and limestone are very similar rocks.

Dolomite often forms when limestone recrystallizes after burial. Many limestones are biochemical; some may be chemical (inorganically precipitated). Evaporite rocks form when sea water or lake water dries up and precipitates gypsum (CaSO 4 ·2H 2 O), halite (NaCl), or other minerals. Evaporites are chemical sedimentary rocks.

sedimentary rock, rock formed at or near Earth's surface by the accumulation and lithification of sediment (detrital rock) or by the precipitation from solution at normal surface temperatures (chemical rock). Sedimentary rocks are the most common rocks exposed on Earth's surface but are only a minor constituent of the entire crust, which is dominated by igneous and metamorphic rocks.

Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.

Dolomite, or dolostone, is a carbonate sedimentary rock made mostly from the mineral dolomite, CaMg (CO3)2. It commonly occurs in association with limestone and shares many of the same properties, but reacts only weakly with acid. Dolomite often has a sugary texture and is typically off-white to gray in color.

The Dolomite Problem. The question of how the mineral dolomite, occurring in sedimentary rocks throughout the Earth, was created in large quantities has concerned the geology for over 200 years now - with only moderate success in explaining it. Dolomite was identified in 1791 by the French mineralogist Déodat de Dolomieu ().

## sedimentary rock - Carbonate rocks: limestones and dolomites
Carbonate rocks: limestones and dolomites. Limestones and dolostones (dolomites) make up the bulk of the nonterrigenous sedimentary rocks. Limestones are for the most part primary carbonate rocks. They consist of 50 percent or more calcite and aragonite (both CaCO 3).Dolomites are mainly produced by the secondary alteration or replacement of limestones; i.e., the mineral dolomite [CaMg(CO 3) 2

Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed by compaction and cementation of clasts composed of individual mineral grains or pieces of rock.

Dolomite is a sedimentary rock resulting from limestone and lime mud coming into contact with groundwater that is rich in magnesium. Because of that, the rock is quite similar to limestone in its coloring and composition. Dolomite is also called Dolostone to prevent confusion with the mineral dolomite which is a significant part of the stone

## Hydrothermal-sedimentary dolomite - Journal of Palaeogeography
The Middle Permian Lucaogou Formation in the Jimusar Sag, eastern Junggar Basin, NW China, was deposited in a salt lake within an intracontinental rift basin with intense hydrothermal activity. Hydrothermal-sedimentary dolomite in the form of three types of dolostones, namely, analcime-feldspar dolostone (AFD), silicic dolostone (SD) and buddingtonite-albite dolostone (BAD), related to syn

## Dolomite Rock - Sedimentary Rocks - Sandatlas
Dolomite rock is a very common sedimentary rock, especially older carbonate rocks (formed before the Mesozoic) tend to be dolomites whereas younger carbonates are predominantly various limestones. Dolomite is usually very similar to limestone and the two are often indistinguishable in the field. Geologists usually carry small bottles of dilute
