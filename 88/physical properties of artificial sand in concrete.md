## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Nov 9, 2021Unlike sand from rivers, artificial sand is manufactured by breaking down the large aggregates of rocks and mines into smaller portions with a defined size of 4.75mm. It is majorly implied in the construction industry. Furthermore, the other major components used in the production of artificial sand include fly ash concrete.

Therefore, the mix design method of concrete by ANN can be used in the same area or the same production line of seawater sea sand concrete. Besides, we may consider adding properties of concrete materials to the model in the future, such as chloride ion content and shell content of sea sand. In this way, it can also improve accuracy of ANN results.
