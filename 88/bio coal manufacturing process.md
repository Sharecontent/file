It takes up to 3.21 MJ of energy to evaporate one kg of water in the process of heating the firewood up to the needed pyrolysis temperature of around 400° C from an ambient temperature. This takes into account the fact that water vapour is also heated to the same temperature as the wood-gas.

The biogas production process is the same for all types of biogas, and it leverages chemical reactions that are 100% natural. By placing biomass (organic waste) in a digester, you enable bacteria to break down the organic elements and turn them into biogas, which can then be used to generate energy. It's a zero-waste process that reduces the

## Bio-coal Market - PW Consulting
The process of bio-coal preparation in short is the rapid pyrolysis of renewable biomass (e.g. rice husk, sawdust, corn stover, etc.) first at 500°C in an anaerobic atmosphere to produce bio-oil and biochar.  wheat straw, bagasse and soybean straw are used as representatives for the production of bio-coal. The yield of bio-coal derived from

## Reliability modelling and performance analysis of bio-coal 
Man-made or natural catastrophes cause disruptions of the entire demand-supply chain. Generally, it takes longer to make up the demand-supply chain and ultimately there is a loss of revenue and reputation. The major purpose of this paper is to evaluate the cost-benefit and reliability of a bio-coal manufacturing plant with deviation in demand. Whenever demand deviates, it affects the
