## Air pollution from Australia's coal-fired power stations generate $2.4 
Coal-fired air pollution is generating an estimated $2.4 billion in health costs annually in Australia, according to a new report by actuaries, economists, and lawyers. They say the health bill stems from a lack of pollution controls on coal-fired power stations which are exposing 2.1 million Australians to toxic pollutants. And they describe

## Environmental impacts of coal - Global Energy Monitor
Air pollution from coal-fired power plants. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, in an average year, a typical coal plant (500 megawatts) generates the following amounts of air pollutants: 3.7 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO 2), an amount equivalent to chopping down 161 million trees.

## Impacts of coal-fired power plants for energy generation on environment 
Flue gases, bottom ash, and fly ash formed during fuel combustion are examples of pollution occurring from the combustion process. Land use of the power plant, coal mining and transport, and feeding of the coal to the combustion chambers can also cause pollution. The cooling water is another pollution source to the surrounding water systems.

## Pollution Caused by Coal Fired Power Stations
Acid Rain and certain medical conditions, have been linked to emissions from coal fired power stations. Sulphur dioxide (SO2) forms acid particulates in the air and these are absorbed through our lungs, into the blood stream, causing ill health. In some cases, serious illnesses and even death have been blamed on this type of pollution.
