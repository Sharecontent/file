## Fostering the Sustainability of Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining  - MDPI
The exploration and mining of Nigerian barite are primarily by artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) whose operations are characterized by poor productivity. As a result, the quantity and quality of barites produced do not satisfy the nation's oil sector demands and other industries that require the mineral. This situation leads to massive importation of the mineral with negative impact on

Missouri Barite DNR. Mining Barite mining in Missouri began around 1850; however early lead mining operations began as early as 1725 in the same area but barite was cast aside as a waste product at that time. Barite production data has been recorded from 1872 to present. The Washington County deposit is the major source of Missouris barite
