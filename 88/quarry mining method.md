## What are the reasons for quarrying?
How does mining and quarrying cause landslides? Mining and quarrying operations use explosives in their blasting techniques to break rocks and gather ore deposits. They cause land areas to slide due to the vibrations from the blast. Construction activities such as building of roads and railways may interfere or change the natural drainage of water.

Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.
