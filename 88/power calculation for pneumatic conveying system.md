##  Introduction to Pneumatic Conveying of Solids - AIChE
What is pneumatic conveying? Pneumatic conveying is the movement of solids through pipe using gas (usually air) as the motive force. It differs from hydraulic or slurry conveying in that the gas expands continuously along the pipe length. The flow regime in the pipe depends greatly on the ratio of solids to gas and the particle characteristics.

Pneumatic systems (single cylinder control) In day-to-day life, compressed air can be used to inflate a bike or car tire or to clean an area. But compressed air can also be used as a driving force that gives motion to pneumatic tools. For example, a pneumatic drill or a nailgun (see Figure 1) can be operated with compressed air. Figure 1.

## Pneumatic Conveying of Bulk Materials | Blower Engineering
Pneumatic conveying systems are used to transfer powders, granules, and other dry bulk materials through an enclosed pipeline. The motive force for this transfer comes from a combination of pressure differential and the flow of a gas, such as air or nitrogen. Positive displacement blowers generate pressurized or vacuum air to provide the
