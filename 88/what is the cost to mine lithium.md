## How Environmentally Responsible is Lithium Brine Mining? It Depends on 
Lithium mining accounts for less than 10% of freshwater usage and its brine extraction does not correlate with changes in either surface-water features or basin-water storage. Lithium, says David Boutt, professor of geosciences at UMass Amherst and one of the paper's co-authors, is a strange element.

## Lithium Supply - Hard Rock vs. Brine - New Age Metals Inc.
As it turns out, lithium hydroxide is better suited in the production of the batteries with NCM 811 cathodes when compared to its alternative, lithium carbonate. Although lithium carbonate can be converted into lithium hydroxide, it comes at an additional cost. This is causing brines to look less attractive to battery producers, leading to

## How Does Lithium Mining Actually Work and Will We Have Enough?
The lithium content of ocean water is far lower, hovering around 0.17 parts per million. However, about 20 percent of the lithium in seawater can be recovered using a combination of membranes, filters, and ion-exchange resins. Brine mining is normally a lengthy process that takes anywhere from eight months to three years.

A friend of mine is adamant that the extraction of lithium for batteries (and the creation of battery cells themselves) is a very environmentally-damaging procedure, potentially even more-so than oil (open-cut mines vs oil wells), and that this is only going to get worse as more and more EV cars hit the roads, age, and need their batteries replaced.

## Explainer: the opportunities and challenges of the lithium industry
What are the social and environmental impacts of lithium mining? Approximately 500,000 gallons are used to produce one tonne of lithium. In Chile's Salar de Atacama, mining activities consume 65% of the area's water. In a region where annual rainfall is less than 15 millimetres per year, the activity depletes already scarce water resources

## What is the environmental impact of lithium batteries?
The cost of lithium batteries is around 73 kg CO2-equivalent/kWh (Figure 1). Production of a single battery with a range of 40 kWh (e.g. Nissan Leaf) and 100 kWh (e.g. Tesla) emit 2920 kg and 7300 kg of CO2, respectively.  Lithium mining is a source of pollution and can have negative environmental impacts. However,
