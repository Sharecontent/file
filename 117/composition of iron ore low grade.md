## Manganese phosphating process pdfutyfo
The low concentrations of Mn2+ and NH4+-N in electrolytic manganese residue leachate (EMRL) have seriously hindered the development of the electrolytic manganese industry. In this study, an electrochemical process combined with H2C2O4-modified phosphate ore flotation tailings (MPOFTs) for the synergistic removal of Mn2+ and NH4+-N in EMRL was.

Blast Furnace Slag is shaped when iron pellets or iron ore, coke, and limestone or dolomite (Flux) are heated together in a blast furnace. When the metallurgical melting procedure is finished, the lime in the flux has been chemically united with the aluminates and silicates of the ore and coke ash to procedure an outcome named blast furnace slag which is non-metallic.
