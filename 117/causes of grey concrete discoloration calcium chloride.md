It is a mixture of Portland cement, water, and aggregates such as sand, rock, or gravel. It does have limitations, but adding calcium chloride allows the mixture to set more quickly and increases its initial strength. For concrete contractors, it improves performance and reduces costs. Calcium chloride accelerates cement's rate of hydration.

Common reasons for concrete turning black are trowelling too much (known as trowel burn) and inconsistent water ratio in multiple concrete batches used in the same project. Other causes could be uneven curing and the use of calcium chloride (de-icing salts, e.g.). Some black discoloration can be removed while others cannot.

## Concrete Discoloration: Drying Different Colors or Spotty - Concrete 
A frequent reason behind a darkened-concrete appearance is the addition of calcium chloride to accelerate the setting time of concrete (see Photo 1), especially when calcium chloride dosages approach 2% by weight of cement. Inadequate mixing after addition of calcium chloride makes the concrete color even more irregular or blotchy.

Another very common reason is moisture. Batches with different moisture levels may not cure evenly which can also result in black spots. Calcium chloride, variations in the cement's alkali content, additives, and workmanship are even more potential causes. Water damage or de-icing salts can also be to blame.
