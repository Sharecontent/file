## Improvement of Processing of Gold-Bearing Sulfide Minerals by Treatment 
Two products were obtained as a result of beneficiation—magnetic product 1 (mp 1) and non-magnetic product 1 (nmp 1). Studies on a wet laboratory polygradient separator were carried out at a magnetic field intensity of 1.28 T. Iron shot with a diameter of 3-6 mm was used as a ferromagnetic matrix of a polygradient separator.

## Beneficiation of Iron, Iron Extraction Process, Iron Ore Extraction
The beneficiation of iron ore is based on the magnetic difference of iron ores. Relying on its rich experiences in the iron extraction process, Xinhai has established two main iron ore extraction systems.  And this combined process reduces more flotation processing quantity and reagents than direct flotation and saves a lot of flotation
