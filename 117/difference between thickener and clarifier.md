The Difference Between Pool Clarifier and Flocculant. Clarifier is a milder chemical than flocculant making for a slower work rate. Your pool's reaction to the clarifier may take a couple of days before you see the results. So, if you are needing a quick fix for a pool party only hours away, clarifier will not be the choice for you.
