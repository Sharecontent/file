Nov 24, 2021Iron ore is an important raw material for steel production enterprises. In most cases, iron ore with a grade of less than 50% requires ore beneficiation before smelting and utilization. Natural ore (iron ore) is gradually selected for iron through procedures such as crushing, grinding, magnetic separation, flotation, and gravity separation.

## iron ore beneficiation explained
Beneficiation = Improve Concentration of Iron. Ore is either Hematite (Fe2O3) or Magnetite (Fe3O4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into a blast furnace without any further processing. Iron ore that contains a lower iron content must be processed or beneficiated to increase its iron content.

## iron ore beneficiation process design case study
At many operating mines, ore processing facilities (OPF) have been constructed to enable beneficiation of low-grade iron ores, including ores which have been contaminated with shale, to be mined and, after upgrading, sold as high-grade products. The operation of the OPFs has also increased the iron ore resources available at these mines.

## Dry beneficiation of iron ore - Mineral Processing
The haematite ore in South Africa is processed in a dry process to a HQ lump ore with 64 % iron content and a sintered fine ore with 63.5 % iron content. For fine ore beneficiation, wet processes are used. Capacity at the Minas Rio is to be increased from 26.5 Mta capacity to 28 Mta in the forthcoming years.
