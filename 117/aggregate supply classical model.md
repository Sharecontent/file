Keynesian economics suggests governments need to use fiscal policy, especially in a recession. (This is an argument to reject austerity policies of the recession. 3. Government borrowing.

Like classical economic thought, new classical economics focuses on the determination of long-run aggregate supply and the economy's ability to reach this level of output quickly.

1 Approved Answer. The classical model asserts that the economy is very free-flowing and that prices and incomes adapt quickly to changes in demand over time. To put it another way, when things are going well, wages and prices rise quickly, and when things aren't going well, wages and prices fall quickly. The primary premise of this model is

## Compare And Contrast The Classical Model And The Keynesian | Cram
The Classical Model is an economic model that "was the first systematic attempt to explain the determinants of the price level and the national levels of real GDP, employment, consumption, saving, and investment". (Miller, 2016) It is a model that implies that an economy is self-regulating and that the supply of goods is proof of their demand.

The Classical model shows the aggregate supply curve as vertical because this model holds that the economy is at its full employment level. The Keynesian model shows the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping because wages and prices are less flexible in the short-run.

Because production in the classical model depends on capital, natural resources, labour, and technological knowledge, we can classify shifts in the long-run aggregate supply curve as arising from these sources. 1 Shifts Arising from Labour. Imagine a scenario, where an economy undergoes an increase in immigration.
