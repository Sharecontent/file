## High Energy Ball Mill - Nanografi Nano Technology
Description, High Energy Ball Mill, Ball Mill is a grinder that blends or grinds materials for various applications. Impact force enables size reduction in feed material. The cylindrical shell rotates around its horizontal axis. The main element enabling grinding is the hard and small balls in the ball mill. These balls are usually made of steel.

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

1. As the name suggests, the ball milling method consists of balls and a mill chamber. Therefore over all a ball mill contains a stainless steel container and many small iron, hardened steel, silicon carbide, or tungsten carbide balls are made to rotate inside a mill (drum). 2. The powder of a material is taken inside the steel container. This powder will be made into nanosize using the ball milling technique.

## Optimization of high-energy ball milling process for uniform p-type Bi 
Feb 11, 2022Abstract. Ball milling is widely used for producing powders of thermoelectric materials owing to its simplicity and scalability. In this research, we investigated the particle shape and size in p-type Bi-Sb-Te materials—the best-known and only commercially available thermoelectric materials at present—after high-energy ball milling. Although Bi-Sb-Te materials are known to be brittle, some ductile properties, such as particle agglomeration and welding, were observed.

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
Besides materials synthesis, high-energy ball milling is a way of modifying the conditions in which chemical reactions usually take place either by changing the reactivity of as-milled solids (mechanical activation — increasing reaction rates, lowering reaction temperature of the ground powders)—or by inducing chemical reactions during milling (mechanochemistry).

High-energy ball milling is a ball milling process in which a powder mixture placed in a ball mill is subjected to high-energy collisions from the balls. High-energy ball milling, also called mechanical alloying, can successfully produce fine, uniform dispersions of oxide particles in nickel-base super alloys that cannot be made by conventional powder metallurgy methods.

The Attritor's design accounts for much of the difference: conventional ball mills turn the entire drum or tank containing the media and the material, while Attritors stir the media in a stationary tank with a shaft and attached arms or discs resulting in a more efficient use of energy for the milling process. Further, Attritor tanks are all jacketed which allows for more precise temperature control during high energy ball milling.
