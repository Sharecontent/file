## Extraction of Iron | Metallurgy | Blast Furnace and Reactions - BYJUS
At 900 - 1500 K, In the lower sections of the furnace, C + C O 2 → 2 C O. F e O + C O → F e + C O 2. The limestone also decomposes to CaO which removes the silicate impurity of the ore in the form of Slag. It can be easily separated out of molten iron. The iron manufactured in Blast Furnaces contain about 3 - 4 % of Carbon and smaller

## Electrolysis of Iron Ores: Most Efficient Technologies  - SpringerLink
This technology comprises alkaline electrolysis as a way to reduce CO 2 by transforming the iron ore into metal and oxygen (O 2) requiring electrical energy only. No direct CO 2 would be emitted applying this technology, which is still in a development phase. The first obtained results were the definition of the influence of the operating
