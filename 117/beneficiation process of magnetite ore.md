## Magnetite beneficiation process
Separation process of strong magnetic iron ore. It is mainly used to select low-grade magnetite. Because the ore has strong magnetic properties and is easy to grind, the current stage grinding is often used for coarse-grained magnetite, while the multi-stage grinding process is used on the contrary. Grinding technology can increase the
