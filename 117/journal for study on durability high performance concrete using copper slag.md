## Investigating the Effects of Copper Slag and Silica Fume on Durability 
Workability, strength, durability, economic considerations, and attention to sustainable development issues are some crucial factors in designing an appropriate mix. The use of copper slag as a partial replacement of cement is an effective method of pollution reduction and conservation of resources, since it reduces cement use. In addition, silica fume is used in combination with copper slag

Nov 21, 20202.2 Mix Design. Using the preliminary test results (Table 1), a control design mix was designed as per IS and IS .The control mix ratio is 1:1.47:2.77. 2.3 Design of Experiments. Past researches show that the sand replacement with copper slag up to 50% enhances the compressive strength of concrete [], and the concrete shows upward trend in compressive strength values only up

The aim of this study was the valorization of paper sludge waste from paper industry in designing one-part geopolymer cement using ground granulated blast furnace slag as main precursor. The effects of increasing the amount of paper sludge pretreated with a constant amount of sodium hydroxide (2% of slag) on mechanical strength, heat evolution
