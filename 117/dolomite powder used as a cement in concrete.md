## Properties of concrete with binary binder system of calcined dolomite 
The porosity of concrete decreases at a low water-cement ratio by mixing dolomite powder and fly ash with cement . The improved microstructure of hardened mortars is obtained for an optimal substitution range of 30-50% of dolomite powder [ 29 ].
