What is a ball mill? A ball mill is a size reduction or milling equipment which uses two grinding mechanisms, namely, impact and shear. 1 Unlike other size reduction equipment, such as breakers and jaw crushers, ball mills are capable of producing powders and particulate materials of mean particle sizes within the 750 to 50 micron (µm) range.. Ball mills serve both dry and wet milling
