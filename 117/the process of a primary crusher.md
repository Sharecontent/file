## Compact primary crusher for above and underground applications
The crusher was born out of a need for a high capacity underground primary crusher that did not require a primary feeder, scalper, and the associated infrastructure therein. Minimizing the need for high cost stationary grids to control topsize underground was a requisite, and the large topsize acceptance was met with the UG design.
