Mixtures containing large amounts of gold and small amounts of mercury (50:1) can be quantitatively separated by passing a 2N hydrochloric acid solution of the chlorides through Dowex 50 resin. Mercury behaves as a cation and is quantitatively retained. Gold behaves as an union and is not retained by the resin. The gold is obtained spcctrobcopically free from all metals.

Panning. Panning is a gold mining method that uses water to separate the heavy gold particles from the lighter materials in the ore. When panning for gold you put your crushed gold ore in a wide pan and then add water to it. You then swirl the pan around with the aim of removing the lighter materials along with the water.

Mercury We used mercury to get the gold out of the powdered rock. Gold, like most minerals, can be 'dissolved' in mercury to form what's called an amalgam. An amalgam is a physical mixture, a type of alloy. This is a comparatively straightforward way of separating the gold from the rock, as the rock remains untouched by the mercury.

## Summary of Mercury Amalgamation Gold Extraction Process
The principle of gold extraction by using mercury (amalgamation method) is mainly that after the mercury is added to the slurry, the surface of the gold particles is wetted by mercury, and then the mercury diffuses into the interior of the gold particles, causing a chemical reaction. Au+2Hg=AuHg2. Finally, the solid of Au3 Hg will form. When the obtained solid matter is heated, the mercury

I don't have a cite, however my room mate used to work at Homestake Gold Mining Company. According to him you do one of two things to remove mercury from gold: use a Nitric acid wash (probably what you're looking for) or boil it off (mercury boils at 650f, gold at either 1965f or 1995f) and draw it off with a vacuum system. Hope this helps.

## inorganic chemistry - Why does mercury decolourise a gold ring 
Mercury has the same effect on silver as it does on gold and the coins would become super shiny with a slick feel. After a few days, the mercury would either evaporate or oxidize leaving the coins badly tarnished. This is why it was common to find strangely dark looking silver coins in circulation.

## How Can You Separate Gold From Mercury? - Global Guideline
Answers: 1. Gold (Au) and mercury (Hg) are two separate metals. Therefore, from pure mercury you cannot extract Gold. 2. Amalgamation is better suited to ores in which the gold occurs in the free and cores state. Fine particles of Gold are better treated by Cyanidation. 3. Gold dissolves in aqua regia.
