## Applications of Iron Ore Pellets & Iron ore Pelletization Process
So methods like pelletizing and sintering ensures that there is no waste of this precious resource. What Is Iron Ore Pelletization Process The process of pelletization begins with the use of finely powdered grains of iron ore. These grains are then converted into balls. This iron ore concentrate is next heated and dried over high temperatures.
