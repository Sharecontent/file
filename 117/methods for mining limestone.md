## Acid Mine Drainage: Origins and Assessment of Methods
Mining of this mineral resource was rampant and was done on large scale. Recently, the impact of coal mining on rivers and streams has been brought under necessary checks and balances. For instance, new and better methods of mining coal which are also environmentally friendly have been devised (Pašava & Kříbek, 1995).

## Sampling and analysis method for measuring airborne coal dust mass in 
It consisted of pulverized limestone with at least 70% mass in the ≤ 74 μm size range (Allegheny Mineral Corp., Kittanning, PA). Limestone dust is typically used for explosion mitigation since it is widely available and inexpensive. Coal and rock dust mixtures with 20%, 91%, and 95% (mass) rock dust were prepared using a pestle and mortar.
