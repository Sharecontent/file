Then, hot gas and fine materials enter a multistage "cyclone". This separates fine ground material from its gases. The resulting very fine raw material is conveyed to a silo. From there the raw material, now called kiln feed, is fed to the top of the kiln for sintering. Raw materials are cooked and turned in a kiln at approx. 1,450°C.
