In electrode production with coal pitch as the binder, the characteristics of pitch—the yield of volatiles and the ash content—are somewhat less important than the content of materials insoluble in toluene (the α fraction) and quinoline (the α 1 fraction). Pitch quality depends mainly on the coal tar, whose composition and properties affect practically the whole technological chain

In a process for producing carbon fibres from coal tar pitch, the coal tar pitch is filtered before being spun and the pitch filtrate is distilled in a thin-film evaporator in order to increase its softening point over 260° C. A pure and homogeneous hard pitch is thus obtained, without the re-formation of infusable, chinolin-insoluble components.
