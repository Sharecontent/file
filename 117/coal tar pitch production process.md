## WOA1 - Process for producing coal-tar pitch - Google
In a process for producing carbon fibres from coal tar pitch, the coal tar pitch is filtered before being spun and the pitch filtrate is distilled in a thin-film evaporator in order to increase its softening point over 260Â° C. A pure and homogeneous hard pitch is thus obtained, without the re-formation of infusable, chinolin-insoluble components.
