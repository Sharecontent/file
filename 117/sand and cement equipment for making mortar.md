The ratio of cement to sand should generally be 1 : 3 to 1: 6 for the mortar to be workable and strong. The use of mortars of lower cement content is unsatisfactory since any notable reduction in cement contents leads to reduced workability and less cohesion and will produce porous joints with a tendency for low frost resistance.

## Can I Make Concrete with Just Sand and Cement? (What To Do) - Gizmo Plans
The reason concrete cannot be made simply by mixing sand with cement is that it is a composite material that needs a coarse aggregate to achieve this strength. In essence, concrete is a mixture of Portland cement, water, sand, and rocks. The cement or paste coats and binds the sand and rocks. Then, a chemical reaction called hydration, which is

## Function of Sand in Mortar - Civil Engineering
Sand helps to prevent mortar shrinkage. It also prevents cracking of mortar during setting. Well-graded sand increases the density of mortar. Sand allows Carbon-Di-oxide from the atmosphere to reach to some depth in case of ft lime mortars and thereby improves their setting capability. It is also claimed that some chemical reaction takes place
