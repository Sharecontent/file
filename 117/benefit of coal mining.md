Results of the study were used to aid the State government in evaluating proposals for continued underground coal mining. We show that impacts of mine subsidence on streams, swamps, and Aboriginal sites negatively affect community wellbeing. Social welfare increases with the length of time that the mine provides direct employment.

## Mining affected areas and its impact on livelihoods: Meghalaya
Coal mining. Coal is an important mineral resource of Meghalaya and is mined through a primitive mining method commonly known as rat-hole mining. The coal deposits present on the hill-slopes and along the riversides are mined by 'side-cutting'.  The benefits seem to be short term and limited to a small number of people. Impact on water.

In an open-pit mine or quarry, a drone survey refers to the use of a drone (or UAV - unmanned aerial vehicle) equipped with a downward-facing RGB camera to capture images of a site from different vantage points. Out of these images, a photogrammetry software can recreate geo-referenced 3D maps, contour lines digital terrain models or digital surface models of the mining site.
