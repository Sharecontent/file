A karat measures the purity of gold expressed as the number of parts of gold it contains out of 24 and is stamped on the gold piece as K or KT. So a gold bar labelled as 16K or 16KT means that the alloy contains 16 parts of gold, whereas 8 parts of other metals. This gold purity measurement uses a scale of 0 to 24 so the higher the karat number

24 karat = 99.99% gold. Also known as 99.99% investment-grade gold, 24 karat gold is the highest grade - the purest form of gold you can buy and own. 24k denotes that out of 24 parts, 24 is pure gold (24/24) without any other metals included. The reason gold can never truly be labelled 100% is that there may be trace elements of other metals
