These complications occur because cement-stabilised materials usually contain an aggregate of gravel or crushed rock. These aggregates create a specimen surface that is very textured and rough, which causes problems with positioning linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) during measurements (Figure 6.50). The positioning of the LVDTs must be precise when determining the modulus of elasticity and Poisson ratio, so similar variation was found in the results for static modulus as

Gravel is a major basic raw material in construction. Sand is not usually distinguished from gravel in official statistics, but crushed stone is treated as a separate category. In 2020, sand and gravel together made up 23% of all industrial mineral production in the U.S., with a total value of about $12.6 billion.

## Aggregate | Earth Sciences Museum | University of Waterloo
Aggregate materials are either used in their natural state or after crushing, washing, and sizing. The materials can be used loosely, or sand, gravel, and crushed stone can be combined with a binding media to form concrete, mortar or asphalt. The mining process begins with the removal of the overburden to reveal the materials underneath.
