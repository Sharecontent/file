## Segregation of Iron and Titanium in an Iron Sand Concentrate Pellet 
An iron sand concentrate was pelletized and reduced using coal under the isothermal-temperature gradient profile with a controlled heating rate starting from 1000 °C to a final temperature of °C. Each pellet was a non-composite mixture, where coal as a reductant was added to cover the whole surface of the pellet.

## How did they make Iron in the Iron age | Bushcraft Buddy
When iron is heated and compressed the bonds between the iron molecules become closer together and increase in strength. Simply getting the metal red hot and smashing it with a hammer over and over will make it strong enough to make the harder tools, and when people realised this it gave birth the large scale mining operations.

Ductile Iron and Sand. Sand plays a vital role in the casting process. Being slightly permeable, it allows gas to move out while at the same time chilling the liquid metal, which solidifies from the outside in. Packing density and sand composition must be managed carefully to ensure consistent metal shrinkage and part quality.

Iron Age metallurgists alternated adding charcoal and iron ore powder. After a few days, they lowered the temperature and extracted a bloom, which is a mass of iron and steel mixed with slag. In the photo below, you can see what a bloom looks like: the shiny bit is steel, the dull gray part is iron, and the black bits are slag. Iron bloom.

The iron separated from the surrounding rock but never quite melted. Instead, it formed a crusty slag which was removed by hammering. This repeated heating and hammering process mixed oxygen with the iron oxide to produce iron, and removed the carbon from the metal.

## Iron- and Steel-Making Process | SpringerLink
Iron is extracted in the form of metallic iron (Fe) by reducing the oxide ores with a reducing agent. The principal agents commonly employed to serve this reduction process are the naturally occurring forms of carbon such as coke, charcoal and coal. In order to extract the iron, Fe (55-60%)-rich ore is usually used.

## iron processing | Definition, History, Steps, Uses, & Facts
Sep 7, 2022When iron making was properly established, two types of furnace came into use. Bowl furnaces were constructed by digging a small hole in the ground and arranging for air from a bellows to be introduced through a pipe or tuyere. Stone-built shaft furnaces, on the other hand, relied on natural draft, although they too sometimes used tuyeres. In both cases, smelting involved creating a bed of red-hot charcoal to which iron ore mixed with more charcoal was added.

According to its carbon content, iron can be divided into pig iron and wrought iron. Pig iron contains between 2.11 and 4.5 percent carbon, wrought iron less than 0.0218 percent and steel between (0.0218 and 2.11 percent). Thus, it is possible to make steel by purifying pig iron by removing some of the carbon, or by adding carbon to wrought-iron.

Step 3 - Primary Smelt. In order to reach the required heat of 1,538 °C, a bellows would be used to constantly blow air into the smelter to increase the temperature, it would also be layered alternatively with coal and iron ore. When the temperature was hot enough the iron would melt and start to run out of the ore.
