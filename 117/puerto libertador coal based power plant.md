## Coal power plant in Narra, Palawan, the Philippines | EJAtlas
May 13, 2021Description: In July 2012, DMCI Power signed a power supply agreement with the Palawan Electric Cooperative, with the intent of building a small 15 MW coal plant in Narra, in the province of Palawan, as part of its 25-MW power supply agreement signed with the Palawan Electric Cooperative (Paleco), which was then grappling with a supply problem.

## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
Sep 23, 2021A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines that turn generators.

A thermal power plant is one kind of plant or system, which is used to produce electrical power by using thermal energy. Fig. 1 Thermal power plant. Coal is mainly used as fuel. Normally brown, bituminous, and peat coals are widely used. Water is used as secondary fuel which helps to transfer thermal energy from coal.
