## Coal power plant in Narra, Palawan, the Philippines | EJAtlas
May 13, 2021Description: In July 2012, DMCI Power signed a power supply agreement with the Palawan Electric Cooperative, with the intent of building a small 15 MW coal plant in Narra, in the province of Palawan, as part of its 25-MW power supply agreement signed with the Palawan Electric Cooperative (Paleco), which was then grappling with a supply problem.

## What Is Coal Power Plant and How Does it Work?
Sep 23, 2021A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station that burns coal to generate electricity. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel power station. The coal is usually pulverized and then burned in a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to spin turbines that turn generators.
