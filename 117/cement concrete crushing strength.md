## The effect of temperature on the compressive strength of concrete
The crushing strength of concrete at temperatures up to 600°C was independent of the water/cement ratio used but was influenced by the aggregate/cement ratio. Concrete specimens loaded to produce normal design compressive stress during the period of heating showed less reduction in strength than specimens without imposed load.

Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures.

The strength of concrete is controlled by the proportioning of cement, coarse and fine aggregates, water, and various admixtures.

## High strength concrete
The methods and technology for producing high strength concrete are not substantially different from those required for normal strength concrete. The target water/cement ratio should be in the range 0.30-0.35 or even lower. HSC can be produced with all of the cements and cement replacements (additions) normally available in the UK.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete Using Different Curing Methods
Four different methods of curing (ponding, continuous wetting, open-air curing, and sprinkling with water) were used. Seventy-two (72) cubes were cast using a mix ratio of 1:2:4 and 1:3:6 with 0.5
