## New approach suggests path to emissions-free cement
Ordinary Portland cement, the most widely used standard variety, is made by grinding up limestone and then cooking it with sand and clay at high heat, which is produced by burning coal. The process produces carbon dioxide in two different ways: from the burning of the coal, and from gases released from the limestone during the heating

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.

## RAW MATERIALS IN CEMENT PRODUCTION
The only common feature in all cement production plants is the difficulty of grinding the source material as the material is hard enough and has high abrasiveness. That is why high quality grinding balls with high hardness over the entire section are used during grinding materials in tube mills in this industry.

## How Cement Is Made
Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden. Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium, silicon, aluminum, iron and other ingredients. Common materials used to manufacture cement include limestone, shells, and chalk or marl combined with

In the manufacture process of cement, clinkers are formed. These cement clinkers are cooled down and added with small amount of gypsum. The mixture then sent to final grinding process. For ordinary Portland cement it remains between 3 to 4% and in case of Quick setting cement it can be reduced up to 2.5%. Role of Gypsum in Cement

A 10 MW cement mill, output 270 tonnes per hour. A cement mill (or finish mill in North American usage [1]) is the equipment used to grind the hard, nodular clinker from the cement kiln into the fine grey powder that is cement. Most cement is currently ground in ball mills and also vertical roller mills which are more effective than ball mills.

## Improving particle size distribution in cement production
Enhancing cement grinding efficiency is beneficial for numerous reasons: Lower energy costs. An improvement in grinding efficiency means increased fineness at constant kWh/t or, more typically, lower kWh/t for constant fineness. Increased mill production. Higher grinding efficiency delivers the same fineness at higher output.

As a general rule, there should be less than 25% of clinker that is below 1mm in size. Coarse clinker is more of an issue for ball mills.
