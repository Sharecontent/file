## What Are the Advantages of Wet Grinding vs. Dry Grinding?
Dry grinding, as in a jet mill, uses a single pass process; material enters the mill, passes through, and is expelled, reduced in size. In contrast, wet grinding uses a process of recirculation. The slurry is exposed to the grinding media over and over, for hours if necessary, until the desired particle size is achieved.

The Backgrinding Process. To improve the productivity of an operation, a multi-step grinding operation is generally performed. The first step uses a large grit to coarsely grind the wafer and remove the bulk of the excess wafer thickness. A finer grit is used in the second step to polish the wafer and to accurately grind the wafer to the
