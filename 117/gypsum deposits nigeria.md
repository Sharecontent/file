One such mineral with great industry use and but largely underdeveloped in Nigeria, is gypsum. About one billion tones of gypsum deposits are spread over many sites in Nigeria. It is an important input for the production of cement. It is also used for the production of Plaster of Paris (P0P) and classroom chalk, etc.

## Gypsum Mining in Nigeria; The Pre-Feasibility Report.
The existence of gypsum in Nigeria has been reported since 1921. Gypsum deposits are found in the sedimentary basins of the country. Identified deposits are found in Adamawa, Taraba, Yobe, Borno, Bauchi, Benue, Ogun, Sokoto, Edo, Kogi, Abia, etc. About one billion tons of gypsum deposits are spread over many sites in Nigeria. The quality of gypsum is a function of the calcium sulphate (CaSO4) content.
