## A Day in the Life: What Goes On at a Quarry - MDLPA
The quarrying process is also known as "extraction.". This procedure consists of removing blocks or large pieces of stone from a previously identified geological deposit. The different methods used to quarry or extract the limestone depends on the specific properties of the limestone deposit itself, including density, bedding planes, and depth.

This process is called "metamorphism." There are also rare "igneous" carbonate rocks that have crystallized from molten magma in the same way that lavas or granites have.

When the quarry is finished, the pumps are turned off and the water flows back in. When the water is exposed to the air, the CO2 degasses. This allows the pH to rise and for Calcium Carbonate to precipitate. The CaCO3 is very finely crystalline and remains suspended in the water column giving it that "Bahamian" blue color. One of the most popular rock quarries is the Eno near Durham, where
