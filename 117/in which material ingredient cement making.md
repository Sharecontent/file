## 8 Main Cement Ingredients & Their Functions - Civil Engineering
The main features of these cement ingredients along with their functions and usefulness or harmfulness are given below: Lime: Lime is calcium oxide or calcium hydroxide. The presence of lime in a sufficient quantity is required to form silicates and aluminates of calcium. Deficiency in lime reduces the strength of the property to the cement.
