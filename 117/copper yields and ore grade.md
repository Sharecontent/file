## copper processing - Ores | Britannica
For lower-grade deposits located near the surface, the open-pit method is the most practical for the mining of large tonnages of material. Large track-mounted drills prepare the ore for blasting, and the broken ore is hauled to the ore-dressing plant by truck (at up to 150 tons per load) or conveyor. In underground mining, vertical shafts are sunk well over 1,000 metres (3,300 feet) below the

With an average ore grade of 1.6% copper, KGHM produces approximately 700 thousand tonnes of red metal. The core products of KGHM are electrolytic copper cathodes with minimum 99.99% of copper content. What is more, the company processes ore to obtain concentrate and metallic copper in the form of wire rod, Cu-OFE and Cu-Ag wire and granules.

Copper matte is a mixture of copper sulfide (Cu 2 S) and some iron sulfide (FeS). Matte is a process in which copper is extracted before the final reduction. when a hot blast of air is blown through a molten matte placed in a silica lined converter, FeS of the matte oxidizes to FeO. This FeO combines with SiO 2 (silica) to produce FeSiO 3 ; (slag).

Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur. Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.

Mined ore quality varies due to natural differences in mineral concentrations, irregular ore boundaries, and mining processes. Grade control systems attempt to segregate ore and waste so ore is sent to the process plant and waste is discarded.

## Some observations on copper yields and ore grades
The average copper content of ore deposits is usually below the average yield of the ore accessed in the early years of production. The initial grades of new mines have not declined over the past forty years, and there has been no perceptible tendency for the average grade of porphyry deposits brought into production to decline over time.

## Different Grades of Copper - Belmont Metals
Free-machining copper containing sulfur falls under the UNS C14700 designation while copper containing telluride will have the C14500 rating. Understanding the different grades of copper will allow you to select the right metal that will be cast and machined for the application. It will also help you to determine the copper that will provide
