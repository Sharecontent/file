## to determine crushing strength of coarse aggregate
Strength of Coarse Aggregate. The strength of the actual material will determine the final strength of the concrete mix. Some rocks and stones are stronger than others thus, giving higher resistance to cracking and crushing. Granite, for example, is far stronger than limestone. Therefore, it is a common aggregate used by contractors.
