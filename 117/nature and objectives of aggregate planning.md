## Aggregate production planning with multiple objectives in a fuzzy 
The present study is to evaluate the performance of different aggregate production planning (APP) strategies in presence of uncertainty. Therefore, the relevant models for APP strategies including the pure chase, the pure level, the modified chase, the modified level and the mixed chase and level strategies are constructed by using both multi-objective programming and simulation methods.

## What Is Aggregate Planning? (With Importance and Types)
What is aggregate planning? Aggregate planning is the process of analyzing and forecasting the demand for an organization's goods or services and its capacity to fulfill it. Its main purpose is to give the company's management an idea regarding the resources it needs to cover the demand in an efficient way, without over or underproduction.
