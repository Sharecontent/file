## The Facts about Fertilizer Raw Materials, Availability and Pricing
Certain fertilizer raw material factories around the world were temporarily closed.  Calcium sources include limestone and gypsum rock, although lime and gypsum may be derived from industrial processes. Fortunately for greenhouse and nursery growers, some irrigation waters can supply significant sources of calcium, magnesium and/or sulfate.

## Gypsum as a soil additive: use it or lose it? - MSU Extension
Gypsum can be used as a source of calcium and sulfur, however, remember: Gypsum is more soluble than lime and can add calcium more rapidly to the soil. This may result in decreasing potassium or magnesium levels in the soil. Monitor this by soil testing. Michigan soils generally are calcareous-based soils meaning they are derived from materials

Gypsum is a fertilizer product and supplies the crop-available form of calcium (Ca 2 +) and sulfur (SO 4 2-). If these forms are deficient in soil, then crop productivity will benefit if gypsum is applied. This is a big "if" for Iowa soils. Research has not shown deficiency of Ca and normally any potential problem with low Ca levels is taken
