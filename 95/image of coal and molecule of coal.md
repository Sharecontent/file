## Graphene
Graphene (/ ˈ ɡ r æ f iː n /) is an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice nanostructure. The name is derived from "graphite" and the suffix -ene, reflecting the fact that the graphite allotrope of carbon contains numerous double bonds.. Each atom in a graphene sheet is connected to its three nearest neighbors by a strong

## Molecular Structure of Coal - ScienceDirect
The molecular sieve model of coal structure considers coal as consisting of relatively light, hydrogen-rich molecules trapped in a hydrogen-poor carbon matrix (Aczel et al., 1976). The basis for this model is the work reported in Section VI on the low molecular weight compounds of coal. A corollary of the presence of large numbers of these low

## Fuels -- Coal - World of Molecules
What is Coal? Coal is a fossil fuel extracted from the ground by mining. It is a readily combustible black or brownish-black rock. It is composed primarily of carbon and hydrocarbons, along with assorted other elements, including sulfur.. Including inherent moisture, coal consists of more than 50 percent by weight and more than 70 percent by volume of carbonaceous material.

Mar 11, 2021· The coal molecular number was temporarily set as 10 and the target density as 0.7 g/cm 3 which is an approximate general density of lignite. The geometric optimization was carried out by DMol3 to obtain an ideal initial coal molecular layer structure (Xu et al. 2007). The layer of coal after establishment is shown in Fig. 3a.

Coal. Coal is formed in nature by the carbonization of wood. Conversion of wood to coal under the influence of high temperature, high pressure and in the absence of air is termed carbonization. Amongst coal varieties, anthracite is the purest form. It contains about 94 - 95% of carbon.

Coal is slightly denser than water (1.0 megagram per cubic metre) and significantly less dense than most rock and mineral matter (e.g., shale has a density of about 2.7 megagrams per cubic metre and pyrite of 5.0 megagrams per cubic metre). Density differences make it possible to improve the quality of a coal by removing most of the rock matter
