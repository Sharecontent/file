Moment of force 1. STATIC- deals with the bodies in equilibrium, meaning the net force is equal to zero, provided these forces are concurrent (their lines of action intersect). The effectiveness of a force in changing the rotational motion of a body depends on its perpendicular from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the forces.

Colloid mill is a machine used in the disintegration of solid particles or droplet size of a liquid present in suspension or emulsion. The machine consists of an inlet (which is subjected to a tremendous shearing action that effects a time dispersion of uniform size) and an outlet. Colloid mill works on the rotor-stator principle.

## how a water mill work in relation to application of moment of force
Dec 16, 2021A water mill works by diverting water from a river or pond to a water wheel, usually along a channel or pipe. The water's force drives or pushes the blades of the wheel (or turbine), which then turns or rotates an axle that drives machinery that is attached to it to do work.

## The Application of Calculating Moment Of Force And Its Importance To 
A better application of the term in this discipline is the moment of force, or the tendency of a force to cause a body or mass to rotate around a defined point or axis. A moment develops whenever a force vector does not pass through the centroid of a mass, which in practical consideration is the typical case for structural applications.
