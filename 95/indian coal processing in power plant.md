The first ultrasupercritical (USC) plant (NTPC's Khargone) was commissioned in 2019. By 2023 India is expected to have 250 GW of utility coal- fired generating capacity in operation, almost a third of which will be SC or USC. The hope is that this impressive performance of improving efficiency will be continued.

## New procedure to reduce pollution from coal-fired power plants
India, in fact, has officially announced that it would not set up any new coal-fired power plants after 2022. However, we still have to live with coal for some more time at least. In spite of the rapid increase in power generation from renewable sources like wind and solar, over 60% of India's electricity is still generated in thermal power

## Environmental impact of coal industry and thermal power plants in India 
Coal is the only natural resource and fossil fuel available in abundance in India. Consequently, it is used widely as a thermal energy source and also as fuel for thermal power plants producing electricity. India has about 90,000 MW installed capacity for electricity generation, of which more than 70% is produced by coal-based thermal power plants.
