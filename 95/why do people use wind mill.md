## Offshore Wind - How Does It Work and Why Is It Good?
The offshore wind industry works by constructing wind farms on the sea. Especially on the portion of shallow water in between a continent and the deep sea. The goal is to harvest the energy of the wind and produce electricity, as with traditional wind turbines. The only difference is that at sea, the winds are much stronger than on land.

## How Much Oil Do Wind Turbines Use? - Wind Turbine Magazine
The amount of oil used by a wind turbine varies greatly depending on the size and type of turbine. A small turbine for powering the home only requires a very small amount of oil, whereas the largest offshore wind turbines regularly need topping up with large amounts of oil and other lubricants to keep them running efficiently.

## What is Windmill?- Definition, Types, and Uses - Engineering Choice
Today, the windmill's modern equivalent - a wind turbine - can use the wind's energy to generate electricity. Wind turbines, like windmills, are mounted on a tower to capture the most energy. How Do Windmills Work? Wind turbines operate on a simple principle. The energy in the wind turns two or three propeller-like blades around a rotor.

How do wind turbines work when it not windy? If there is too little wind and the blades are moving too slowly the wind turbine no longer produces electricity. The turbine starts to create power at what is known as the cut-in speed. Power output continues to grow as the wind speed increases but at a slower rate than it does right after the cut

## The purpose of windmills in the Netherlands
Functions of windmills in Holland. Historically, windmills in Holland served many purposes. The most important probably was pumping water out of the lowlands and back into the rivers beyond the dikes so that the land could be farmed. In the fourteenth century, hollow-post mills were used to drive scoop wheels to drain the wetlands.

## Advantages and Challenges of Wind Energy
Wind energy helps avoid 329 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. (link is external) emissions annually - equivalent to 71 million cars worth of emissions that along with other atmospheric emissions cause acid rain, smog, and greenhouse gases. Wind power benefits local communities. Wind projects deliver an estimated $1.9 billion.

Why did old farms have windmills? Homesteaders farmers and ranchers were no longer dependent on natural water as they could drill wells and pump water. Windmills were often among a homesteader's most prized possessions. The water pumped by windmills was used to cook bathe drink water crops and animals wash clothes and more.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images News/Getty Images. A windmill uses wind power to create rotational energy for the use in mills, pumps and presses. In the Netherlands, where windmills became important for local economies, they were used to make boards, paint, oil, paper and bread. The pumping of water was the earliest use of windmills.
