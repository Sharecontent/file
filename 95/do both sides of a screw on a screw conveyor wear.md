A vertical screw conveyors conveys material upward in a vertical path. It requires less space than some other types of elevating conveyors.Vertical screw conveyors are also referred to as 'Lifts' or 'Elevators'. A vertical screw conveyor can handle most of the bulk materials provided there is no large lump. The maximum height is usually limited to 30m.

## The Most Common Problems with Flexible Screw Conveyors and How to 
Nov 24, 2021Flexible screw conveyors can convey materials in any direction. They can even be routed around fixed obstacles and equipment, making them one of the most popular types of screw conveyors. From tubular screw conveyors to U trough conveyors, all systems can be susceptible to a range of issues.For example, even the most well maintained or manufactured tube screw conveyor can experience problems

High speed screw conveyors, often known as augers are frequently used in agricultural applications and can be used vertically. The screw rotates at around 750 rpm and its diameter is usually not more than 20 cm. BUT - they tend to be quite inefficient, and have a rapid rate of wear, particularly of the flight and the thrust bearings.
