The most workable amount of SiO 2 should be under 1% that our Limestone has 0.94% of Silica. Another important point is the L.O.I that it is an abbreviation for Loss On Ignition that results from heating a sample of the material to a high temperature. It is also called free moisture. This grade of Limestone has 42.1% L.O.I.

According to the rules, now every limestone miner will have to pay an additional fee of Rs 150 per metric tonne only as royalty to the forest. The association claims that if the forest rules are not repealed, the Nepalese cement industry, which is preparing to export cement worth Rs 150 billion, will shut down due to the high cost.

Limestone is the key raw materials for the cement making industry where chemical properties are important. Portland cement is produced by the calcination of finely ground raw mixture of limestone and clay (Bouazza et al, 2016). Cement industry is major player for the construction of infrastructures in the development of any country.
