Cement production currently increases by about 3% per year, and it is likely that the contribution of the cement industry to CO2 emissions is likely to keep pace with or overtake global population increases. To reduce human-led global warming and climate change, eventually CO2 emissions must decline to a very small fraction of current emissions.
