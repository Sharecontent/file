## Cement Industry - Plant Process Audits - Featured Industry - PEC 
Modern, dry-process cement plants with efficient configuration of grinding and pyro processing systems typically consume less than 700 kcal/kg-cl thermal energy and 100 kWh/mt of electrical energy. Older plants have inefficient systems, which compounded with operational and maintenance inadequacies, tend to have much higher energy consumption.

All the cement plants set up after 1980 use the dry process for the manufacture of cement. In this process, the calcareous materials such as limestone are crushed and stored in silos or storage tanks. The argillaceous material such as clay is thoroughly mixed with water in a container known as the wash mill.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Cement Production - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Abstract. Cement production is an energy-intensive process. The cost of energy constitutes more than 60% of the cost of the cement; hence cement plants have to consider minimizing the cost of energy when planning production. However, there are several challenging issues regarding the production plan.

## Process Of Cement Plant
The last stage of making cement is the final grinding process. In the cement plant there are rotating drums fitted with steel balls. Clinker after being cooled is transferred to these rotating drums and ground into such a fine powder that each pound of it contains 150 billion grains. This powder is the final product cement.

Phase IV: Calcination. The calcination is the core phase of the cement making dry process. The calcination of the preheated raw meal takes place in the rotary kiln of the cement plant. The rotary kiln is a huge rotating furnace in which the raw meal is heated up to 1450 ⁰C and turned to clinker. The high temperature in the rotary kiln
