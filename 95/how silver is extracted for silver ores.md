Silver is extracted from lead ores in large furnaces, a process called cupellation. Most silver is extracted from ores with a froth flotation process, which was discovered early in the 20 th century. In this process, crushed ore is placed in a bath. Air bubbles are blown through the mixture to carry the silver to the top of the bath where it

## Silver mining
Ore processing. Once removed from the mine, silver-containing ore is crushed (commutation) into a fine powder to expose individual grains to chemical processing.As a byproduct of mining of lead and copper, silver ores are often purified by froth flotation.After froth flotation, silver is extracted by a cyanide process, akin to technology used for gold extraction.

## How is silver extracted from its ore? Explain the process  - Sarthaks
Silver is extracted from the argentite ore by the Mac-Arthur and Forrest's cyanide process. The various steps involved in this process are as follows : (a) Concentration : The crushed ore is concentrated by froth floatation process. (b) Treatment of ore with NaCN : The concentrated ore is treated with 0.4 - 0.6% solution of sodium cyanide
