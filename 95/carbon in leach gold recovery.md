##  ACTIVATED CARBON IN GOLD RECOVERY - Kemix
This article serves to discuss the fundamental aspects of gold recovery utilizing the Carbon-in-Pulp or Carbon-in-Leach processes. The purpose is to describe in simple terms what activated carbon is all about and how it adsorbs gold. The understanding of the mechanism of gold adsorption is important because the CIP/CIL processes work as

The impurities must be removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes used for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences between the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed. 1. Extracting Metals Low in the Reactivity Series.

Cyanide is a lixiviant, or reagent that is used to leach, often in tanks, gold from a solid matrix and form a gold cyanide complex. The gold cyanide complex is then extracted from the pulp or slurry by adsorption onto activated carbon. CIL stands for carbon-in-leach. This is a gold extraction process called cyanidation where carbon is added to

A double refractory gold ore contains gold particles locked in sulphides, solid-solution in arsenopyrite, and preg-robbing material such as carbonaceous matter, and so on. The diagnostic leach test (DLT) and preg-robbing (PR) approaches are widely used to investigate the occurrence and the distribution of refractory gold. DLT serves to qualitatively evaluate the gold occurrences within the ore.

Gold Recovery Process. For gold recovery, water and a cyanide such as calcium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or potassium cyanide, are added to ore or scraps to form a slurry. The gold will leach out and mix with the cyanide into a solution. Activated carbon is then used to separate and store the gold, which is removed as the final step of the process.

The most common way to recover gold and silver dissolved from the ore in the leaching process is the use of an Adsorption/Desorption/Recovery circuit commonly referred to as ADR circuit. In this circuit, activated carbon, typically made from coconut shell, is used to recover the gold and silver ions from the slurry.

## Gold Recovery | InterCarbon
Gold Recovery. Activated Carbon fulfills a crucial role as the key element in Leach Circuits, Carbon in Leach, and Carbon in Pulp processes. We are a major manufacturer of activated carbon specialized for the gold mining industry and precious metals recovery to be utilized in both Carbon Leach and Carbon Pulp methods.

## GOLD RECOVERY
For gold recovery, water and a cyanide such as calcium cyanide, sodium cyanide, or potassium cyanide, are added to ore or scraps to form a slurry. The gold will leach out and mix with the cyanide into a solution. Activated carbon is then used to separate and store the gold, which is removed as the final step of the process.
