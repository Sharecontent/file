## Starter motor, starting system: how it works, problems, testing
The starter motor is an electric motor that turns over or "cranks" the engine to start. It consists of a powerful DC (Direct Current) electric motor and the starter solenoid that is attached to the motor (see the picture). Starter motor. Click for a larger photo.

AVR to the alternator exciter is not affected by any voltage distortions (harmonics) due to the load. The AREP system gives the alternator a high short circuit capability for LSA range: 300% - 10 s. The permanent magnets used in the PMG ensure enough remanent magnetism and secure the system startup, even after long shut-down periods.

## Working Principle of AC motor with basics and Construction - eTechnophiles
The AC motor working principle is based on the simple principles of magnetism. But before discussing the AC motor working principle in detail, let's get the basics out of the way. AC is an abbreviation for Alternating Current. While a DC or Direct current remains constant with time, an Alternating Current changes its direction periodically.

The changing magnetic field is created by the three-phase or splits phase current fed to stator winding and since this magnetic field cuts the rotor conductors producing induced current in the rotor which opposes the changing magnetic field of the stator. And thus, producing a rotating motion. The working of this motor will be further as we discuss the construction and design.

## How does an exciter work on a generator? - Heimduo
How does an exciter work on a generator? In the past, the exciter was a small DC generator coupled to the same shaft as the rotor. Therefore, when the rotor rotates this exciter produces the power for the electromagnet. This output from the exiter then controls the magnetic field of the rotor to produce a constant voltage output by the generator.
