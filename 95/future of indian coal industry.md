After nationalisation of coal industry in India, India never witnessed demand-supply gap until 1991. Soon after came the liberalisation of India with a clear impact on economic growth. In 1993, to focus on the increasing energy demand, the government decided to allocate coal mines to various players for captive consumption.

The figures show that India's emissions from coal would peak at somewhere between 700 and 1200 megatons in the near future, and then begin to decrease rapidly around the year 2040 or 2050 depending on lifespan assumptions. Most importantly, the cumulative emissions could range anywhere between 18 and 38.5 gigatons.
