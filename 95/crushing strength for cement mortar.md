## Compressive strength
The compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve. In a compression test, there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence, for this region, =, where, this time, E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region, the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.

##  Mortar testing
Testing the performance of the cement component of mortar is made by measuring the strength of the finished mortar under specified laboratory conditions. The various constituents used to produce mortar are routinely tested to established standards by the constituent manufacturer in order to demonstrate the grade or type.

Portland Cement Compressive Strength. The most common strength test, compressive strength, is carried out on a 50 mm (2-inch) cement mortar test specimen. The test specimen is subjected to a compressive load (usually from a hydraulic machine) until failure. This loading sequence must take no less than 20 seconds and no more than 80 seconds.
