Chemical weathering on the nephrite jade surface and formation of ferruginous crust and phyllosilicate clay crystals. Other than inside the micro pore system, dissolution and leaching also occur on the jade surface resulting in etch pits formation as nephrite crystals dissolve. These pits are shallow due to the limit of water penetration.
