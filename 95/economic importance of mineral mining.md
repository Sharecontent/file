## Chapter 2 Economic Importance of Bauxite Deposits
This chapter discusses the economic importance of bauxite deposits. The production of alumina consumes over 90% of the bauxite's world production (excluding the U.S.S.R. and China), while the remainder is used for abrasives, chemicals, and refractories. Depending on the mineral composition of the bauxite (gibbsite, boehmite, and diaspore

## What are minerals and What are economically important minerals?
Oct 18, 2021A mineral is a chemical compound that has a precise chemical composition and is unstable and solid. It is a naturally occurring compound. It is unstable and the internal structure is ordered. Mineralogy is the study of minerals. Diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires produced in the industry are similar to gems, so they are called man-made minerals.

## Economic Iron Bearing Minerals
Hematite. Hematite is possibly the most economically important iron mineral. It is an iron oxide, with the chemical formula of Fe 2 O 3. It is variable in colour, from black to deep red and is often the mineral that gives red-brown sandstone its colour. Pure hematite usually contains around 69.9% Fe.

A mining operation must either own the land being mined or secure a contract for the "rights" (the legal right) to mine the land. But being free to mine the land is only the beginning. The mining company must invest in equipment and facilities. Beyond that, the mining company must have one or more buyers for its raw materials.

## 9 Ore Deposits and Economic Minerals - Mineralogy - OpenGeology
Many different mineral commodities are important to modern society. However, when mineralogists think about mining, they are generally thinking of ore minerals that are the sources of important metals, or of minerals that have specific, highly valued properties (e.g., asbestos, micas, potash, and gems of all sorts).That is what we will focus on in most of the rest of this chapter.
