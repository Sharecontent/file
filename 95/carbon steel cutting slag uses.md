## Manufacturing Process of Steel - Properties Fabrication Uses
Vacuum treatment (generally called vacuum degassing) is a commonly used steelmaking process, used for removing dissolved gases (e.g. hydrogen) from the steel. In this process, the steel is exposed to a vacuum which promotes transfer of dissolved gases from the liquid steel to gas phase.

## Pros and Cons of Carbon Steel: What You Should Know
Carbon steel is a special type of steel that, as the name suggests, has a higher concentration of carbon than other types of steel. Most types of steel have a relatively low carbon content of about 0.05% to 0.3%. In comparison, carbon steel has a carbon content of up to 2.5%. Two-and-a-half percent carbon may sound insignificant, but it

High-carbon steel. High-carbon steel has a carbon content of 0.60- 1.25 wt.% and a manganese content of 0.30 - 0.90 wt.%. It has the highest hardness and toughness of the carbon steels and the lowest ductility. High-carbon steels are very wear-resistant as a result of the fact that they are almost always hardened and tempered.

It can cut steel thickness from 1 mm to 1200 mm. And in most cases it used to cut steel plate thickness more than 20 mm, since oxy fuel cutting usually brings big tolerance
