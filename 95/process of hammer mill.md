## Cattle Feed Pellet Mill-How to Make Cattle Feed
Cattle feed pellet is an all-in-one pellet form feed made by feed pellet mill through great pressure. It is a kind of feed that is not only for oxen, cows, cattle but also for sheep, and goat reared for their milk and meat. It contains protein, minerals and other nutrients which are useful for beef and milk production and survival of the animals.

## Hammermill
A hammer mill is a mill whose purpose is to shred or crush aggregate material into smaller pieces by the repeated blows of little hammers. These machines have numerous industrial applications, including: Ethanol plants (grains) A farm machine, which mills grain into coarse flour to be fed to livestock. Fluff pulp defiberizing.

The hammer mill design is very robust and is used in many applications, from grain milling to heavy duty requirements such as rock crushing or waste grinding. Hammer mills are part of the impact mill family, which means that the milling effect is obtained thanks to the speed at which particles are impacted, here, by one or several rotors. 2.

Hammer mills are designed with a shaft on which are mounted several "hammers" which have most of the time the shape of thick plates. The shaft is rotating within a casing, and at the outlet of the mill is mounted a screen whose size will determine which particles are fine enough to leave the mill. The mill can be fed and discharged by gravity
