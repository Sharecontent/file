## Low transferrin saturation normal ironnliebchen
The transferrin saturation can help differentiate between iron overload and other causes of elevated ferritin. Transferrin saturation is the ratio of serum iron and TIBC (serum iron /TIBC). Transferrin saturation is high in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, typically > 45% and sometimes >55%.

## Theory and Practice of Sintering of Iron ore - IspatGuru
In one such study mixtures of iron ore fines (concentrates), return sinter fines and limestone have been prepared at concentrate/ore ratios of 20:80, 50:50, 80:20 and 100:0 and sinters have been produced with basicities of 0.8, 1.4 and 2.0. Incorporating increased amounts of concentrates in the sinter mix has made granulation more complex.
