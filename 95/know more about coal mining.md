Nancy Irwin Maxwell, in Encyclopedia of Energy, 2004. 1.1 Environmental Impacts of Underground and Surface Mining of Coal. Coal mining traditionally took place underground, with men and equipment following seams of coal deep within mountains. Since the 1960s, surface mining methods have become more common, and today they account for more than half of the coal produced in the United States.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

## Coal Types, Formation and Methods of Mining
Surface Coal Mining. Surface mining is accomplished by removing overburden from the coal seam and then blasting and removing the coal. The ratio of overburden excavated to the amount of coal removed is called the overburden ratio. The lower the ratio, the more productive the mine. The lowest overburden ratios are found in western surface mines.

Many U.S. coal deposits, called coal beds or seams, are near the earth's surface, while others are deep underground.Modern mining methods allow coal miners to easily reach most of the nation's coal reserves and to produce about three times more coal in one hour than in 1978.

## Coal | Global Methane Initiative
Coal mines are one of the largest sources of anthropogenic methane emissions. As the world produces more coal, coal mines get deeper every year, and methane emissions grow with increasing mining depth. Mine operators also abandon old coal mines, which still emit methane into the atmosphere. The U.S. EPA, in collaboration with the Global Methane

## Strip Mining: A Destructive Way of Coal Extraction
It is important to know that there are three key ways in which coal extraction and in particular surface mining affect wildlife and biodiversity:  Yet the industry often prefers to strip mine because it takes less labour and yields more coal than underground mining. In some countries, such as Australia, strip mines make up 80 percent of

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
Longwall mining involves the full extraction of coal from a section of the seam, or 'face' using mechanical shearers. The coal 'face' can vary in length from m. Self-advancing, hydraulically-powered supports temporarily hold up the roof while coal is extracted. When coal has been extracted from the area, the roof is allowed to
