## Mineralogical Composition of Limestone Rock and Soil from Jubaila 
In view of these behaviors, the dominant clay mineral of the limestone rocks and soil samples is kaolinite. The d (001) values for kaolinite in the clay fraction varied from 0.718 to 0.728 nm with a median value of 0.721 nm. The range for the (002) d-values was narrow (0.358-0.359 nm) compared with (001) d-values.

About Limestone. Limestone is very common in architecture, especially in Europe and North America. Limestone is extracted from quarries or mines. Part of the extracted stone, selected according to its chemical composition and optical granulometry, is calcinated at about 1,000 Â°C (1,830 Â°F) in different types of lime kilns to produce quicklime.

## Limestone, applications - Big Chemical Encyclopedia
Limestone ( calcium carbonate, CaCOj) from mines or quarries is heated in a kiln (calcined). [Pg.23] To reduce soil acidity and keep cropland productive, farmers amend the soil by liming, which is the application of limestone. Limestone is calcium carbonate, and the carbonate anion is the conjugate base of hydrogen carbonate.
