## Hazards and Control Measures among Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold 
Introduction. Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) involves gold mining through basic rudimentary and semi-mechanized methods [].ASGM is usually associated with poor health and safety standards [].In 2017, an estimated 14-19 million miners were employed in ASGM globally [].In Zimbabwe, over 500,000 people are involved in artisanal and small-scale mining, which is largely ASGM [].

## Alternatives to mercury use in small-scale gold mining
Dec 30, 2020In Zimbabwe elemental mercury is used in artisanal and small-scale gold mining. Mercury is mixed with gold-containing materials, resulting in the formation of the mercury-gold amalgam which is then heated, vaporizing the mercury to obtain the gold. This process is very dangerous and can lead to significant mercury exposure with serious environmental and health risks.
