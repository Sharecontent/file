## Lignite or Bituminous Charcoal Fueled Power Plants: Fuel for Power 
Lignites with around 45 % to 55 % moisture require much more heat to remove the moisture. Lignite boilers use recirculated Flue gas from the top of the furnace to heat and remove the moisture. The temperature of the flue gas will be in the order of 800 °C and above. This gives sufficient heat for the high moisture removal.
