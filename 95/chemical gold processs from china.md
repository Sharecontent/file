The most common solvent is cyanide, which must be combined with oxygen in a process known as carbon-in-pulp. As the cyanide and oxygen react chemically, gold in the pulp dissolves. When workers introduce small carbon grains to the tank, the gold adheres to the carbon. Filtering the pulp through screens separates the gold-bearing carbon.

## Everything about Gold Processing - Refine Max Inc
The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
This is a chlorination process that refines gold to a purity of about 99.5%. The process involves blowing chlorine bubbles through molten gold which reacts with metallic impurities forming a chloride slag that is separate from pure gold and floats on top. Gold produced here is then cast into bars ready for the market.
