## Limestone
Limestone is composed mostly of the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). Dolomite, CaMg(CO 3) 2, is an uncommon mineral in limestone, and siderite or other carbonate minerals are rare. However, the calcite in limestone often contains a few percent of magnesium.Calcite in limestone is divided into low-magnesium and high-magnesium

## What is Limestone? - WorldAtlas
Limestone is a sedimentary rock, although it has a hardness of 3-4 Mohs and a density of 2.5 to 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. The rock is primarily composed of calcite or calcium carbonate, with most of these rocks being around 95% calcium carbonate. Being so high in calcium makes limestone rock polish and smooth better.
