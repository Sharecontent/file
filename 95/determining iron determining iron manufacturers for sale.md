## Determining iron bio-availability with a constant heme iron value
Methods available to determine iron bio-availability Literature suggests various models and methods to determine or predict the bio-availability of iron in food. Monsen et al. (1978) developed a model to predict total iron absorption. The Monsen model gives a generally good indication of the amount of absorbable iron in a meal.

Ferritin is an iron-containing protein in your blood. With the help of a ferritin test, you get to measure the ferritin levels in your blood. The test results help in understanding the amount of iron stored by your body. Lower-than-normal ferritin levels indicate that your body has low iron content and that you are suffering from iron deficiency.

## Determination of Iron in Natural Water by Spectrophotometry.
The red-orange complex that forms between iron(II) and 1,10-phenanthroline (orthophenanthroline) is useful in determining iron in water supplies. The reagent is a weak base that reacts to form phenanthrolinium ion, phenH+, in acidic media. A commonly used method for the determination of trace amounts of iron involves the complexation of Fe2+ with

The method described by Ramsay1-2 based on the reaction of ferrous iron with dipyridyl is widely used for determining iron in serum and it was expected that this would be applicable to urine provided that all the iron was free from the chelating agent.

## Determining Percent of Nodularity for Gray and Ductile Iron
Ductile iron has an increased alloy content (magnesium, etc.) and the foundry tries to achieve very few flakes in these castings. With increased round nodules, there is an increase in tensile strength (65,000 to 85,000 PSI). A ductile iron casting with too many linear nodules (flake) could cause a fracture if designed for high-stress applications.
