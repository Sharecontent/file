## Gear Train : Gear Ratio, Torque and Speed Calculations
Step-3: By Multiplying gear-ratio between 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. We will get resultant GR between Driver and Driven Gear. Resultant Multi Gear Train GR = 0. 5 × 0.5 = 0.25. From the above, calculated gear ratio we can calculate the speed and torque at output gear.

A gear ratio greater than 1:1 is achieved when a smaller gear (reduced size) with fewer number of teeth meshes and drives a larger gear with greater number of teeth. Gear reduction has the opposite effect on torque. The rotary machine's output torque is increased by multiplying the torque by the gear ratio, less some efficiency losses.

## When to use gears to change the inertia ratio of a motor-driven system
Adding a gear set or gearbox between the motor and the load can improve the load-motor inertia ratio. If the inertia of the load is significantly higher than the inertia of the motor, the load will essentially try to "drive" the motor, and the motor will have a difficult time achieving the desired position (or speed or torque).

In our example, we would find the gear ratio by dividing the thirty teeth of the driven gear by the seven teeth of our new driver. 30/7 = about 4.3 (or 4.3 : 1, etc.) This means that the driver gear has to turn about 4.3 times to get the much larger driven gear to turn once. 3.

Admissible rated and max torques vary with the reduction ratio. Due to the planetary speed reduction principle, not all ratios are equal, and not all ratios can provide the same performance. The reduction ratio is the ratio between the number of teeth of the sun gear and the number of teeth of the other internal gears (planet gears and ring gear).

For a given ratio-of-reduction, the type of crusher with a flared crushing chamber will usually deliver a cleaner product than any of the older types; conversely, more reduction can be performed in the machine without creating excessive fines. The facts outlined in the foregoing paragraph have an important bearing on crushing plant design.

## Velocity Ratio - definition, formula, and values
We will start with the equation of the Velocity Ratio as the ratio of 2 velocities, as per its definition. Velocity Ratio = velocity of the effort / velocity of the load = VE / VL. Now, if the effort makes a displacement d E in time t, then the velocity of effort V E = d E /t. similarly, if the load makes a displacement d L in time t, then the

## Cone Crushers | McLanahan
Features & Benefits. A Cone Crusher will deliver a 4:1 to 6:1 reduction ratio. As we set the closed side setting tighter to create a finer output, we also reduce the volume or throughput capacity of the machine. Generally speaking, multiplying the closed side setting by two is a good guide to the top size of the gradation exiting the machine.

## What is Gear Reduction Drive? - SMLease Design
Gear Reducers reduce the speed of the driven or output shaft and increase transmission torque. They can have the following applications. Reduction gear drives control the speed and torque transferred to the car transmission from the engine. Reduction gearboxes increase output torque and reduce the speed of a dc motor.
