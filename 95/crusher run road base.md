Another option is "crusher run," which is a mix of 3/4″ stone and smaller stones. Which type of gravel you should use depends partly on whether or not your shed will be located in a wet area. If the ground has moisture, you should consider using 3/4″ bluestone as it will provide additional drainage benefits over the crusher run.

Probably self compacting. #57, which is 1/2 to 3/4-inch gravel is generally considered to be self compacting. This is because there are no fines to inerfer with the movement, so it goes to where there is direct contact between the particles. Short of braking the rocks, which would require a great deal of force, the material won't get any tighter.

## How much volume is lost after compacting 3/4" crushed stone?
From my experience it depends a lot on how is the compaction done. If you are compacting road crush with a vibratory plate you will get about 10 to 15% compaction. (This is based on you having a stable compacted base first. If you are putting the road crush on top of top soil you will lose more to compaction.)
