gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Gold flotation. Flotation process is widely used for lode gold processing. In most cases, the flotation method has a good effect in sulfide-containing gold ore with high floatability. In addition, the flotation process is also used for polymetallic gold-bearing ores such as gold-copper, gold-lead, gold-copper-lead-zinc-sulfur ore.

Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as doré - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

## Gold extraction
Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite
