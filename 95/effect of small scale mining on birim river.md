The Similkameen River is located in North Central Washington (Figure 1). During the public comment period on the Similkameen River Arsenic TMDL (Peterschmidt and Edmond, 2004), concerns were raised by the community and the Colville Confederated Tribe regarding the potential impact of small-scale gold dredging on arsenic concentrations in the river.

CONTEXT. Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining occurs in approximately 80 countries worldwide. There are approximately 100 million artisanal miners globally. Artisanal and small-scale production supply accounts for 80% of global sapphire, 20% of gold mining and up to 20% of diamond mining. It is widespread in developing countries in Africa, Asia

The Birim river gravels hold gold which has long been extracted through panning or Placer mining, used in making ornaments and for trans-Saharan trade long before the Europeans discovered the Gold Coast. Starting in the late 19th century, British gold mining companies adopted conventional mining and extraction processes, developing deep underground mines in the underlying Ashanti belt.
