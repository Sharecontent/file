February 2016 by Chris Ralph. Most prospectors, when they think of hard rock gold deposits, think of quartz containing particles of gold. While gold deposits can be things besides quartz veins, gold is certainly found in the quartz of veins cutting through various types of rocks. Gold in quartz veins occurs as particles and scales scattered

## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

Porphyry copper ore is challenging X-ray mineralogy. The mineralogy of the ore, concentrates and residues is complex. Twenty or more minerals are to be quantified in most of the samples. Peak overlap is massive and may mask minor phases. Clays and other layered material make a reproducible sample preparation difficult.
