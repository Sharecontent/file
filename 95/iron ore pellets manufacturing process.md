## Steel Pellets, Iron Ore Pellets for Sale | Huaro Steel
Pellets are small balls of iron ore used in steel production. They are one of the important sources of iron in the manufacture of steel. Pellet production is the basis of the steel production process. Steel pellets are made from iron ore powder with additives such as limestone, dolomite, olivine and binder bentonite.

Pellets are small and hardened iron balls with a diameter of 10-20 mm and are used as raw material for iron/steel manufacturing. The pelletizing process was commercially introduced in the world market in 1955, following the World War II scarcity of high
