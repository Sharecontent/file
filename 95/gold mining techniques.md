## Gold Mining & Extracting gold: the basics, the methods and the technology
Extracting gold begins in open-pit or underground mining. Then, the gold is separated from the gold-bearing rock with chemical processes involving toxic substances like cyanide leaching, zinc dust, and mercury in a second step. These techniques for extracting gold are very controversial; they can harm people and the environment.
