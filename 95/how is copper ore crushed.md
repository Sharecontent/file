## Acid Leaching - Copper Ore Treatment Method
The treatment of copper ores, both oxides and sulfides by means of flotation, hydrometallurgy or other processes has been well established for many years.  This is accomplished by adding water or solution to the crushed ore to bring the moisture content up to about 10% and mixing in a cylindrical mill or pug mill. By mixing, rounded

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Jan 25, 2022Before the beneficiation of copper ores, crushing and grinding are required. The bulk ores are crushed to about 12cm by a jaw crusher or a cone crusher. Then the crushed materials are sent to the grinding equipment, and the final particle size of the copper ore is reduced to 0.15-0.2mm. Copper ore crushing process. 1.

## Is there a formula to calculate the price of ore containing 20% copper 
Answer (1 of 2): Typically a simple formula is used to calculate the value of the ore. Use the LME price/ton of Cu and the head grade of 20% to get the price/ton of the ore (20% x $$/ton). There are also other things to factor, like contaminants that might cause problems at a smelter or refining

Crushed Copper Ore is created by crushing Copper Ore in one of three different crafting stations. The crafting stations come with different ratios, labor cost and time cost. The two lower crafting stations also have a by product of Crushed Granite. Crushed Copper Ore needs to be further refined to Copper Concentrate before it can be smelted into a Copper Bar.

As specific gravity is just a comparison, it can be applied across any units. The density of pure water is also 62.4 lbs/cu.ft (pounds per cubic foot) and if we know that ammonium nitrate has a sg of 0.73 then we can calculate that its density is 0.73 x 62.4 = 45.552 lbs/cu.ft.

The balance is currently quite good as it means the conversion from rock to ore requires so much crushed rock that it's really only an emergency measure.
