## What is coking of coal? Explained by FAQ Blog
Is coke obtained from coal? Coke is produced by heating coal at high temperatures, for long periods of time. This heating is called "thermal distillation" or "pyrolysis." In order to produce coke that will be used in blast furnaces, coal is usually thermally distilled for 15 to 18 hours, but the process can take up to 36 hours.

## Why is Coke considered a better fuel than coal?
Coke is a fuel obtained from the dry calcination or distillation of coal. It is composed of carbon and has a high calorific value, but is highly polluting. It is used as a fuel in the blast furnaces of steel foundries. The method of producing coke began around 1800, although its production by simple methods had been known for centuries.

Researchers and industry partners will be converting the coal tar, which is a byproduct from coke production for the steel industry, into mesophase pitch — a liquid crystal — which can then be spun and thermally converted to carbon fiber. If successful, this new carbon fiber product could increase the value of coal tar pitch by five to 55

## How To Turn Coal Into Coke - Realonomics
How To Turn Coal Into Coke? Coke is produced by heating coal at high temperatures for long periods of time. This heating is called "thermal distillation" or "pyrolysis."In order to produce coke that will be used in blast furnaces coal is usually thermally distilled for 15 to 18 hours but the process can take up to 36 hours.

Oct 04, 2018· Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful by-products that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first.

From there, the coal is converted into coke and then used in the blast furnace-basic oxygen steelmaking process. Coal does three things in this process: it is burned to supply the huge amounts of heat required, it supplies gases to strip oxygen from the iron ore and roughly 1% of the coal ends up as carbon in the steel.
