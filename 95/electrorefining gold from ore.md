## In electrorefining of copper percentage of gold accumulates in?
Which ions carry the current in the electrorefining of copper? Typical industrial electrorefining of copper is carried out at copper ion concentrations of 35 to 55 g/l and sulfate ion concentrations of 150 to 250 g/l. With the high flow rate, it may be possible to reduce these concentrations slightly because of the higher mass transport in the electrolyte.

## Electrorefining - Electrolytic Gold Recovery | Gold Refineries
Electrorefining is a process that uses the principals of electrolysis to recover gold from an alloy typically found in jewelry. Electrolytic gold recovery begins with a bath of hydrochloric acid, which forms the electrolyte. The cathode is usually a thin sheet of 24K gold, but it needs to be better than 99.5% pure.
