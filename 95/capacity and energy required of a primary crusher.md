## Crusher Efficiency Calculations - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
For the 1-in. screen below the roll crusher the capacity has no correction factor and the area needed is 32/2.1 = 15.2 sq ft. To handle the output from a 40 x 24 roll crusher the screen will have to be at least 24 in. wide. Perhaps it will be more effective to use one continuous screen of at least 20.1 + 15.2 = 35.3 sq ft.

Metso impact crusher. Impact crushers can be used as primary crushers, secondary crushers or tertiary crushers depending on the size and technology. They are equipped with beaters, also called hammers, and impact plates. They operate in the following way: they are fed from the upper part, then the stones are hit by the hammers and projected towards the plates.
