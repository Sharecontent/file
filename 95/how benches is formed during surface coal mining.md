## How Benches Is Formed During Surface Coal Mining
When it comes to mining coal, there are two processes by which coal can be removed from the ground: surface mining, or underground mining. In Australia, the majority of coal mining is done via the opencast method, although often the method of choice is dependent on certain characteristics of the coal deposit 1. Online Chat

## Opencast Mining (Quarrying): Methods, Advantages & Disadvantages 
Opencast mining or quarrying of minerals is easier than mining by underground methods. During quarrying the alluvium and rocks below which the minerals lie, are removed and dumped, in the initial stages, in a place which is not required in future for quarrying, residential or other purposes. The mineral exposed is completely extracted.

## Surface mining - strip, open pit, mountaintop removal, dredging
Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed. It is the other way of underground mining, in which the overlying rock is left behind, and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.. Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface

The catch bench ("CB") or berm is used to catch spalling rock and prevent it from rolling down the pit wall, creating a safety hazard. A rule of thumb is that the catch bench width should be according to the formula 4.5m + 0.2H, where H is the height of the bench. Berms are common safety features seen on mine property.

## Coal extraction method -surface, deep underground mining techniques
Underground mining: Coal at a depth of 180 to 300 ft (50 to 100 m) is deep mined, however in some cases the technique of surface mining are implemented. Underground mining is undergone when the coal is present at the depth of 180 to 350 feet. Room and pillar mining and longwall mining are the two types of underground mining.

Coal Mining Coal can be extracted from the earth either by surface mining or underground mining. Once coal has been extracted, it can be used directly (for heating and industrial processes) or to fuel power plants for electricity. Surface Mining If coal is less than 61 meters (200 feet) underground, it can be extracted through surface mining.

Coal is formed from the physical and chemical alteration of peat. Peat is composed of plant materials that accumulate in wetlands ( bogs and fens), which break down through the process of peatification. If peats are buried, then the peats can be altered into different ranks of coal through the process of coalification.
