Frequency is the cyclic pattern of scalar waves that flash "on" and "off.". The vibrational frequency rate is determined by how fast energy units (partiki) contract and expand. In physics, frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in unit time. Partiki units are the smallest building blocks of matter, even smaller than

As the mass of a vibrating body increases, its frequency decreases, but as the tension increases the frequency also increases. Mass and Tension: Any object that can vibrate is capable of creating a tone. Two factors determine the frequency of the vibration: the Mass of the object and its Tension.

The speed of propagation vw is the distance the wave travels in a given time, which is one wavelength in a time of one period. In equation form, it is written as. v w = f λ. From this relationship, we see that in a medium where vw is constant, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength. See Figure 13.8.

However the vibration propagates through the medium extremely slowly. The receiver will "record" a much lower frequency than the one emitted. The receiver will record the same frequency, only much later, due to the slow propagation. The propagation speed determines the delay between the signal emission and reception.

How fast an energy unit contracts (vibration) and expands (oscillation) will determine the frequency rate of all things. The frequency rate is what sets the rhythm of particle pulsation. This then allows the formation of wave spectra within dimensional reality fields. The process also determines the density levels of matter in the material realm.

Frequency, Amplitude, and G-force The number of times the platform completes 1 cycle of movement per second Different from the speed setting of the machine Measured in hertz Hz The vertical distance the platform travels in 1 cycle Measured in millimeters mm A multiplier for gravity The total force that the body is subject

## Relation between pwm frequency and motor speed
There is NO relationship, per se.You are confusing a method of power control with methods of motor speed control. PWM, or Pulse-Width Modulation, is a means to control the delivery of an average current to a low-impedance load from a low source-impedance voltage source. If such a voltage source were applied in a steady continuous fashion, instead of with PWM, excessive current would flow in

## What is Synchronous speed? Relationship between speed and Frequency 
Relationship between Speed and Frequency. The frequency of the emf generated in the stator depends on the frequency at which poles are rotating. In a one complete cycle of the voltage generated, a pair of field poles passes over the coil. Let the speed of the rotating magnetic field is N revolution per minute(RPM). n = N/60 revolution per second Revolution/rotation per second = f In a one
