Platinum luster is metallic; its hardness is 3.5-4.5. Platinum streak is silver-grey and shiny; and its density is extreme at 21.45, but decreases to less than 20 near its melting point of 1769ºC. Impurities in natural native platinum lower its density to 14-19, and iron impurities may impart a slight level of magnetism. Fluorescence is absent.
