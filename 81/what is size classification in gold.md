## Air Swept Classifier Mill System - How it Works, Benefits | CMS
The CMS Air Swept Classifier Mill System combines dynamic-impact grinding and particle size classification in a single continuous process. Independent drives for the Impact Rotor and Classifier Wheel allow the system operator to independently adjust their rotational speeds, thereby optimizing drag and tip speed control in producing the target particle size distribution.

## Summarizing the 2021 Updated GOLD Guidelines for COPD - U.S. Pharmacist
The GOLD guidelines classify patients into four different categories: GOLD 1 (mild), GOLD 2 (moderate), GOLD 3 (severe), or GOLD 4 (very severe) based on their level of airflow limitation. This is assessed by evaluating a postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC. Refer to TABLE 1 for more information regarding FEV 1 values and GOLD classification.

## is what is size classification in gold
gold size classification. The GOLD classification uses risk factors (GOLD 1 to 4 and number of exacerbations) and symptom severity (mMRC or scale). In case both risk factors would fall in a different category, the highest risk factor is used (eg: GOLD 1 (GOLD A or B) with 2 COPD exacerbations last year (GOLD C or D) would be GOLD C or GOLD D).

There are 31.1 grams in an ounce so 8.33g/31.1g= .2676 ounces of pure gold. .2676x$1609 (spot price) would be $431 in melt, then multiply what you expect or bottom line, say 75% and $323 is you bottom line.

Gold is a very rare substance making up only ~3 parts per billion of the Earth's outer layer (imagine 1 billion smarties in one place and only 3 of them were made of gold!). Its rarity and physical properties have made gold one of the most prized of the Earth's natural resources. When gold is found in rocks it is almost always in a pure state.

The purity of gold is classified by carat: 10k, 14k, 18k, 22k, 24k. The number of carats tells us how much gold is present in the piece of jewel. The number of carats is the fraction obtained based on the number 24, which is the denominator. Therefore, 24k (24/24) is pure gold.

Gold, although rare in quantity, is nevertheless a widely distributed element and may be associated with diverse geological terranes (Antweiler and Campbell, 1982). In Egypt, in addition to the aurifer-ous quartz veins, which constituted the main target for gold since ancient times, gold is associated with some other ore deposit types.
