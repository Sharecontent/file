## Mechanical Performances of Pressure Arch in Thick Bedrock during 
Due to the periodicity of mine pressure, it can easily lead to a wide-range damage of the overburden rock under shallow coal mining conditions, and the falling of the overburden rock is usually a serious threat to the mining safety. Based on the monitoring data of mine pressure in a typical shallow coal mine in northern China, the mechanical model of the surrounding rock in the mining field

The first diamonds were uncovered at the site of the Big Hole in 1871. Until the mine's closure in 1914, up to 50,000 miners excavated the deepest hole ever dug by hand, extending 215 metres underground. While the mine would yield 2,720kg of diamonds and help establish the De Beers mining company, which remains a major industry player to this. Chinese miners in the late 1800s

However, the mechanical behavior of the coal mass under different mining rates is still not figured out yet. At the same time, how to choose an optimal mining rate for the actual mining work still lacks the necessary evaluation method. Some basic researches on the mechanical behavior of coal under different mining rates are still urgent to be done.

Coal miners were paid by the amount and quality of the coal they produced, and they could be fined if there was too much "slack" (the smaller pieces). Quality coal was what owners required, but managers determined the standards for quality coal. Owners could keep costs low by claiming the coal was of a poor quality or rigging their scales.

As underground coal mining has occurred in NSW for over 100 years, it is possible for the position of old mine workings to differ slightly from that shown on the Mine Survey Plans. To account for possible discrepancies in the position of old mine workings, the Underground Coal Mining Areas include a buffer zone around historical mine workings.

## Mechanical Engineering < Colorado School of Mines
The Mechanical Engineering Department offers a design-oriented undergraduate program that emphasizes fundamental engineering principles. Students receive a strong foundation in mechanical engineering disciplines, and a working knowledge of modern engineering tools. Many courses are augmented through hands-on and project-based experiences.

## Effects of water content on mechanical failure behaviors of coal 
The mechanical properties and degradation caused by damage within coal pillar dams determine the safety and stability of underground water reservoirs. This study investigated the influence of moisture content on the mechanical properties and failure behaviors of coal samples by conducting a series of non-destructive water immersion, uniaxial compression, acoustic emission (AE), and computed
