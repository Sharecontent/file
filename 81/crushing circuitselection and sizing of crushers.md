The selection of the right crushing equipment is influenced by many factors some of which are upstream of the crushing plant (e.g. blasting pattern and mining method) and others which are downstream of the crushing plant (e.g. mill and grinding circuit selection). Crushers have more efficient transfer of applied power to the breakage of rock

## Evaluation of size reduction process for rock aggregates in cone crusher
The size reduction process of rocks in cone crushers is one of the most important issues, particularly for the secondary and tertiary stages of crushing operations. In this study, 17 different rock types were considered for the evaluation of their size reduction variations that occurred in a laboratory-scale cone crusher. Based on several mineralogical, physico-mechanical, and aggregate
