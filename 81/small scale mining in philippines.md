## Occupational Health and Safety in Small Scale Mining: Focus on Women 
Small scale mining is a significant source of income in many developing countries such as Papua New Guinea, Bolivia, Colombia, Indonesia, Mali, the Philippines, and Zimbabwe (Shoko, 2002). In the Philippines, small-scale mining has been the leading occupational group among all mineral industries (Caballero, 1996).

## Small-Scale Gold Mining and the State in the Philippines
In recent decades, the Philippines has witnessed a massive expansion of small-scale gold mining. While reliable output data about small-scale mining (SSM) Footnote 1 are lacking, official gold sales to the Central Bank of the Philippines by SSM operators still provide a good indication of this strong upward trend (Fig. 1), with official SSM production repeatedly surpassing that of large-scale

Small-scale mining (SSM) in the Philippines is highly heterogeneous, in terms of degrees of formal-legal recognition, working practices and levels of capitalization and mechanization. Output includes minerals and metals such as chromite, magnesite, silver and copper; but gold is undoubtedly the sector's backbone.
