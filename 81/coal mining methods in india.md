## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

In India, for purposes of mining legislation framed by the Government, minerals which cannot be called coal or lignite are classified as metalliferous minerals and they are governed by Regulations applicable to metalliferous mining.  Hence metal mining methods are more varied and they coal drills are therefore electrically operated. In fact
