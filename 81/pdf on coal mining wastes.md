The environmental impacts of coal mining in South Africa are reviewed. The primary impacts arise from mining, particularly underground mining, largely because South African coal mines are relatively shallow. Coal washing gives rises to large waste dumps, which may ignite spontaneously and cause air pollution.

##  Management of coal combustion wastes - USEA
Management of coal combustion wastes 5 Burning coal in a coal-fired power plant produces a variety of solid residues known as coal combustion products (CCPs), coal combustion residues (CCRs) or coal combustion wastes (CCWs). CCPs are now more commonly called coal combustion by-products (CCBs) because of their increasing beneficial use.
