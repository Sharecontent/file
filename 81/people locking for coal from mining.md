## Why Coal Mining Is Bad - Realonomics
Why Coal Mining Is Bad? Coal mining releases toxic materials into the soil and water. Bad mining can start coal fires which can burn for decades - releasing "fly ash" and smoke filled with greenhouse gases and toxic chemicals. It releases coal mine methane which is 20 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.
