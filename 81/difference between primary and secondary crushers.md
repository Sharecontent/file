## What is the difference between Primary and Secondary sources 
Primary sources can be described as those sources that are closest to the origin of the information. They contain raw information and thus, must be interpreted by researchers. Secondary sources are closely related to primary sources and often interpret them. These sources are documents that relate to information that originated elsewhere.
