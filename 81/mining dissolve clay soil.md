## Environmental Characteristics of Clays and Clay Mineral Deposits - USGS
Clays and clay minerals occur under a fairly limited range of geologic conditions. The environments of formation include soil horizons, continental and marine sediments, geothermal fields, volcanic deposits, and weathering rock formations. Most clay minerals form where rocks are in contact with water, air, or steam.

Dissolved Mineral Sources and Significance. The chemical character of groundwater is influenced by the minerals and gases reacting with the water in its relatively slow passage through the rocks and sediments of the Earth's crust. Many variables cause extensive variation in the quality of groundwater, even in local areas.

To create a real change in a clayey soil structure, you would need to add a 1:1 ratio of sand to clay. Considering the actual volume of clay soil underfoot, that equates to a lot of sand. It is far more practical to use organic matter to help break up clay soil. Compost is your best bet, but organic matter can come from other sources like wood

## What You Need To Know To Till And Work Clay Soil
Clay soil will often be disrupted by tilling because it will bring weeds to the forefront and kill many of the earthworms which are responsible for a lot of the nutrients in your soil. If you are preparing clay soil for agriculture, you may wish to till it once after you add your compost, but you will want to cut back after that.
