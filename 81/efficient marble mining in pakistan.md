## Pakistan Ruby Mines - A Guide to Pakistan Ruby Mining | The Natural 
The biggest physical limitation of Pakistan's mining is that the gems are collected from a primary deposit instead of a secondary deposit. The difference between these types is that primary gem deposits are embedded in the rocks they form in. Secondary gem deposits are already removed from the host rocks through weathering, and are loose.

## Monero mining gpu vs cpuretty.shop
That's one of the biggest differences between CPU and GPU mining. While mining Monero (CPU mining), the processor is doing the heavy lifting and the amount, type and configuration of RAM is also a critical factor. In contrast, GPU mining is obviously GPU intensive, but the CPU does very little and you just need enough RAM for the rig to function.
