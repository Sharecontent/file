Quartz Quartz is a man-made engineered stone surface formed by combining 90% ground quartz (a natural hard mineral) with 8-10% resins, polymers, and pigments. This forms a very hard granite-like surface. How it looks depends on how the quartz is ground: coarsely-ground quartz produces a flecked appearance while finely-ground quartz produces a smooth look.
