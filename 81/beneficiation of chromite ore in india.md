## Investigation of chromite recovery possibilities from coarse and fine 
Tailing streams of an existing chromite plant were characterized and then beneficiated in different methods. Characterization studies have been indicated that chromite grains finely disseminated on the coarse gangue particles in all size fractions (+100 μm). Increase in fineness did not show a significant effect on disseminated chromite grains during coarse tailing beneficiation studies.
