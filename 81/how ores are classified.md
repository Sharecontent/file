## How Is Ore Mined? - Realonomics
How are ores formed? Deposits of minerals form when a medium that contains and transports mineral-making ore releases and deposits the ore. .. When magma or lava cools the magma and ore carried within it crystallize to form tiny minerals in the newly-created igneous rock. Minerals found in such rock might include feldspar or mica.
