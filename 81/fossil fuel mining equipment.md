## The Advantages & Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels - Inspire Clean Energy
1. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable: Once you burn a gallon of oil, it's gone for good - and fossil fuels will run out. It's estimated we have just 100 years of coal production left, 50 years of crude oil, and 50 years of natural gas. That means this is a major problem for us, our children, and our grandchildren.
