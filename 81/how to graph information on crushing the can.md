## An easy way to interact with graph databases using Jupyter notebooks
The graph notebook provides an easy way to interact with graph databases using Jupyter notebooks. Using this open-source Python package, you can connect to any graph database that supports the Apache TinkerPop or the RDF SPARQL graph model. These databases could be running locally on your desktop or in the cloud.

## Compressive Strength of Concrete -Cube Test, Procedure, Results
Concrete compressive strength for general construction varies from 15 MPa (2200 psi) to 30 MPa (4400 psi) and higher in commercial and industrial structures. Compressive strength of concrete depends on many factors such as water-cement ratio, cement strength, quality of concrete material, quality control during the production of concrete, etc

## Graph Databases: What Can They Do? - Oracle
Storing data as a graph and loading it in memory requires only a few easy steps. You can directly load data from standard relational tables into the in-memory server as a graph. Alternatively, load the data into a property graph schema for a persisted copy of the graph, and load from the property graph schema into the in-memory graph server.
