## 5 Easily Extracted Gold Ores and 8 Processing Methods - JXSC
The gold beneficiation process of easy to separate gold ore consists of amalgamation, gravity separation, flotation, and cyanide. The choice of the extraction processing method depends on the nature of the ore and the requirements of the product form. The commonly used beneficiation flow as following.

## How Gold Is Mined | Gold Mining Process | World Gold Council
Gold Mining Operation: 10 - 30 years. The gold mining operation stage represents the productive life of a gold mine, during which ore is extracted and processed into gold. Processing gold involves transforming rock and ore into a metallic alloy of substantial purity - known as dor√© - typically containing between 60-90% gold.

The plating process starts with a gold strike treatment to prevent the exchange reaction. The same strike bath can be used for the first rinse after the gold plating. The current density depends a lot on the processing method; that is, 0.2-0.4 Adm ‚àí2 is used for barrel plating and 0.5-1 Adm ‚àí2 for rack plating.
