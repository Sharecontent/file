Foam glass gravel begins its journey as post-consumer recycled glass. Amorphous container glass is received from local materials recovery facilities, where it's crushed using a ball mill into a fine talc-like powder with <1% contaminant. Glass feedstocks can be cleaned to a lesser extent, but that results in a less consistent output.

## Large & Small-scale Community Glass Recycling, Reuse, & Repurposing
A simple definition of glass recycling is the reprocessing of used glass to form new glass 1. The glass that is crushed and ready to be remelted is called cullet. Glass can also be recycled through crushing and integration into roadway materials or reprocessing into foam glass. Glass bottles can also be cleaned and reused and repurposed.
