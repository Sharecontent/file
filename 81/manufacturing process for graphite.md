The next step is machining the rods to tolerance, for American Carbon's graphite anodes these tolerances are +1/4", -0" on diameter and +1", -0" on length. Some anodes are also predrilled for center connections.

Grooves are also cut along the edges, which will eventually hold the graphite in place. The grooves are filled with a strong glue. Graphite is mixed with clay, and the entire mixture is baked in an oven at 1500°F. The graphite is put inside the wood slat with the glue and another piece of wood is stacked on top, creating a graphite sandwich.
