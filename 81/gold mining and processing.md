Step #6 - Mining samples and determining processing. Once mining gets underway, samples must be taken to determine the precise metallurgical qualities of the ore. This is done in order to determine the appropriate processing technique. Step #7 - Processing (on-site) Once ore is extracted, processing it into pure gold must be done.

The Hammerdown gold deposit was previously mined by Canada-based mining company Richmont Mines between 2000 and 2004. A total of 291,400t of ore was mined and milled, with 143,000oz of gold recovered at an average grade of 15.83g/t Au. Mining ceased in 2004 due to low gold prices, which made mining the remaining gold mineralisation uneconomical.

A mercury-gold amalgam then is formed because gold will dissolve in the mercury while other impurities will not. The mixture of gold and mercury is then heated to a temperature that will vaporize the mercury, leaving behind the gold. This process does not result in gold that is 100% pure, but it does eliminate the bulk of the impurities.
