## The Use of Sawdust Ash As Fine Aggregate Replacement in Concrete
Sawdust Ash (SDA) generated from rice mills is usually delivered to landfills for disposal. Using of sawdust ash in concrete is an interesting possibility for economy on waste disposal sites and conservation of natural resources .This paper examines the possibility of using sawdust ash as replacement in fine aggregate for a new concrete. Natural sand was partially replaced (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%
