## MIT students fortify concrete by adding recycled plastic
Concrete is, after water, the second most widely used material on the planet. The manufacturing of concrete generates about 4.5 percent of the world's human-induced carbon dioxide emissions. Replacing even a small portion of concrete with irradiated plastic could thus help reduce the cement industry's global carbon footprint.

Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

## Investigation of the effect of mineral additives on concrete strength 
Over the last two decades, there has been a greater focus on reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere on a global level. As a result of the use of mineral additives in cement production and the substitution of cement with additives in concrete mixes, the cement industry contributes for around 5% of all emission sources (Jayant, 2013).
