## Beneficiation of Low/Off Grade Iron Ore: a Review
The beneficiation of iron ore is relatively more effective, when RAF operation applied along with magnetic concentration. Data indicate that it enhance the Fe% value from 29% of Fe to 50 % Fe. The magnetic operation removes the slimes, which beneficiate the iron ore of 65.22% of Fe whereas recovery percentage has been calculated 78.42% (Zhu
