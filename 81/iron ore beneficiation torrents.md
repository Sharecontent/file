## Characteristics Of Iron Ore Beneficiation Technology | STET
Iron Ore Beneficiation. Once deposits of iron ore are extracted from the ground, they must be processed in order to increase the iron content and decrease the concentration of gangue minerals. Each deposit has its own unique chemical properties. In order to create a usable amount of iron (Fe), other minerals must be removed from the ore.

Jan 20, 2022Iron ore tailing/slime (-150 m) is produced after scrubbing and wet screening of a low-grade iron ore. Tailing beneficiation of iron ore has been addressed either by flotation or wet high intensity high gradient separation. The present study aims to recover iron values from discarded slime containing assay ~56% Fe, ~6.5% SiO2, and ~7.0% Al2O3

## Iron Ore | Geoscience Australia
In 2018, Australia's EDR of iron ore increased by 3% from 2017 to 49 604 Mt (Table 3). Similarly, there was a 4% EDR increase of contained iron to 24 122 Mt (Table 4). EDR attributable to magnetite deposits have decreased by 1%, likely due to re-assessment of projects and inactivity in the magnetite industry.
