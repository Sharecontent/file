Based on the amount of fly ash used in concrete annually, this saves around 13 million tons of extra carbon dioxide being generated. Recycling fly ash from landfills or impoundments has other environmental benefits as well. One ton of coal ash is equivalent to the average solid waste produced by each American during a 455-day timeframe.

## Fly Ash Topic - American Concrete Institute
Fly ash is a by-product from the combustion of pulverized coal, and is widely used as an ingredient in hydraulic-cement concrete. Because it improves many desirable properties of concrete, it is introduced either as a separately batched material or as a component of blended cement. Fly ash reacts with the hydrating hydraulic cement to form a cementing medium.

Furthermore, it is cost-effective and reduces the quantity of cement required for construction. Typically, 15 percent to 30 percent of the portland cement is replaced with fly ash, with even higher percentages used for mass concrete placements. To achieve this, an equivalent or greater weight of fly ash is substituted for the cement removed.

The ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) is a by-product of iron manufacturing which when added to concrete improves its properties such as workability, strength and durability. This material is obtained by the heating of iron ore, limestone and coke at a temperature about 1500 degree Celsius. The process is carried out in a blast furnace.

## Benefits of Fly Ash Concrete - CivilJungle
What Is Fly Ash? Fly ash is a fine powder that would be a by-product of the combustion of pulverized coal in power plants. Fly ash is a pozzolan, a liquid that contains aluminous as well as siliceous material which creates cement in the presence of water.. When combined with lime and water, fly ash creates a similar composition to Portland cement.. This renders fly ash ideal as a raw material
