## Introduction to Shortwall Mining
GENERAL DESCRIPTION Shortwall mining is one of the newest mining meth¬ods to be introduced into the world coal industry. The technique of shortwalling seems to have a number of origins, but it is generally agreed that it is an outgrowth of pillar-and-stall mining where timbering was employed as the primary means of roof support.

## Longwall Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The gate entries of the longwall face are formed as the coal is mined, with roadways formed adjacent to the gob. Each coal panel is separate from the adjacent workings with a solid barrier pillar. Longwall mining is an efficient and a high production mining method; a single longwall face can produce more than 25 000 tons of coal per day.

Oct 14, 2020Where is long wall mining used? Longwall mining is used in the relatively moderate depths of 120 to 300 m in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland and up to 650 m in the Illawarra Coalfields.

The methods used for deep mining include conventional room-and-pillar, continuous mining room-and-pillar (with or without retreat mining), and longwall mining. With room-and-pillar mining, there is the possibility of leaving pillars of coal to support overlying structures, but in retreat mining, most pillars are removed. Room-and-pillar mining

Coal mining has had many developments over the recent years, from the early days of men tunneling, digging, and manually extracting the coal on carts to large open cut and long wall mines. Other methods include shrinkage stope mining, which is mining upward, creating a sloping underground room, long wall mining, which is grinding a long ore surface underground, and room and pillar mining

## Longwall mining - Global Energy Monitor
Longwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 1-2 m thick). The longwall "panel" (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3-4 km long and m wide. Longwall mining produced 176 million tons of coal in 2007, about 15 percent of total U.S. production.

## Longwall Mining | Citizens Against Longwall Mining
Longwall mining is a high extraction technique where coal is removed in 1,400 ft. panels that stretch for miles. Unlike traditional room and pillar mining, in a longwall mine no coal pillars are left in place to provide surface support above the panel. Hydraulic supports are used to hold the roof up at the working face of the coal seam.

Room and pillar or pillar and stall is a variant of breast stoping.It is a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane, creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars. To do this, "rooms" of ore are dug out while "pillars" of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden.Calculating the size, shape, and position of pillars is a complicated

## underground mining bord and pillar - Capabuild
Currently, raw coal mined through either long wall or bord and pillar mining methods and undergoes primary crushing underground. The De-stoning Plant is proposed to be built on a brownfields site, consisting of transformed land, agriculture and degraded grassland and will link into the existing mine and Eskom infrastructure.

The room and pillar system is used in mining coal, iron and copper ores mainly when found as manto or blanket sediments, stone and aggregates, talc, soda ash and potash. The key to the winning room and pillar mining is opting the optimum pillar size. If the pillars are so small the mine will fall down. If the pillars are so big then significant
