## Copper Smelting Process - Bright Hub Engineering
Modern copper smelters use processed copper ore fed into a flash furnace, typically fired by oxygen which produces blister copper, being further processed in a converter furnace. Molten copper is poured from here into rectangular moulds, the resulting ingots subjected to electrolysis producing a metal of 99.9% purity. Copper can be recycled indefinitely without the base metal being compromised

Process control in flash smelting is based on mass and energy balance from which the operational parameters (oxygen coefficient, oxygen enrichment, and flux demand) are obtained to achieve matte and slag with defined compositions and at defined temperatures. Mineral compositions of copper concentrates, and their blends, have been used in order to optimize the heat process balance.

Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.Zinc smelting has historically been more difficult than the smelting of other metals, e.g. iron, because in contrast, zinc has a low boiling point.At temperatures typically used for smelting metals, zinc is a gas that will escape from a furnace with the flue gas and be lost, unless.

10. The smelter is essentially a large pile of heat-resistant brick that can melt down various types of ore to produce bars of mostly pure metal. The bars can then be used in the construction of certain buildings, or they can simply be sold for a handsome profit. The miner also provides all smelting recipes. The lower intake port is for fuel only.

The remaining mixture is a molten copper sulfide referred to as matte. The next step in the refining process is to oxidize liquid matte in order to remove iron to burn off sulfide content as sulfur dioxide. The result is 97-99%, blister copper. The term blister copper comes from the bubbles produced by sulfur dioxide on the surface of the copper.
