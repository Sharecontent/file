## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
F.M of Ideal fine aggregate for concrete applications are in range of 2.6 to 2.9. Fine sand (lower F.M Value ) reduces the sand requirement % in the total aggregate proportion. On the other hand, coarser sand will require higher sand % in the total aggregate proportion to give a cohesive concrete mix consuming least cement.
