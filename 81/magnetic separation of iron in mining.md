## Magnetic Separation - Mining-pedia
Magnetic separation is the most common process in iron ore processing plant. Due to the difference in ore properties, the magnetic separation methods in actual production are also different, so different magnetic separators are also used. This article will introduce 8 common magnetic separators to you. 04:03:13.

The Reading Rare Earth Magnetic Drum (RED) uses a unique 5 pole magnetic element to generate a field intensity in excess of 0.7 Tesla on the drum skin. The magnetic element design affords the maximum field gradient and the 5 poles enables additional cleaning of the magnetic stream. This gives a very selective separation at high throughputs compared to alternative magnetic separators.
