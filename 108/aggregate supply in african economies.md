Unlike the aggregate demand curve, which is always downward sloping, the aggregate supply curve shows a relationship that depends crucially on time. In the long term, the aggregate supply curve is vertical; On the other hand, in the short run, the aggregate supply curve is upward sloping.

## Aggregate Demand Curve and Aggregate Supply - Economics Discussion
The change in aggregate expendi­ture—initially leads to higher output and higher prices. Over time, however, output falls back to its original value while prices continue to rise. This is a major difference between the aggregate expenditure and income model of the economy and the aggregate demand and supply model.

## Aggregate Supply - Econlib
Aggregate supply is the relationship between the overall price level in the economy and the amount of output that will be supplied. As output goes up, prices will be higher. We draw attention to factors that shift the aggregate supply curve. An adverse supply shock, such as a bad harvest, will cause supply to contract, raising prices and

## Aggregate Supply - Indian Economy Notes - Prepp
Aggregate supply, also known as total output, is the total supply of goods and services produced within an economy in a given period at a given overall price. The aggregate supply curve (AS) describes the relationship between price levels and the quantity of output that firms are willing to provide. Generally, aggregate supply and the price level have a positive relationship.

The Aggregate Demand Curve. Aggregate demand, or AD, refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. We'll talk about that more in other articles, but for now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.
