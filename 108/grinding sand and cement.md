## Why Dry Grinding Does Not Work For Concrete Countertop Sealers
The answer is NO. Dry grinding is not the same as wet grinding, even with the same grit. Dry grinding/polishing tends to burnish the concrete surface, making it too smooth for good sealer adhesion. This applies to any coating sealer, not just Omega and Ovation. The practice of dry sanding concrete using dry sandpaper is often seen as being

Polishing and Grinding Concrete. There are a range of finishes possible from a single piece of concrete. A deep polish will expose more of the large aggregate in the mix, while a light polish will only expose the small specks of sand. A consistent and uniform finish can be achieved by simply burnishing the surface.
