## Review on Beneficiation Techniques and Reagents Used for Phosphate Ores
Phosphate ore is an important raw material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products. While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impurities. In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate, the beneficiation of the low-grade phosphate ore is, hence, of great necessity.

## Gold Ore Beneficiation Process and Equipment - Xinhai
With the depletion of high-grade gold ore reserves, research on medium and low-grade, refractory gold ores and strengthening of traditional gold beneficiation processes have become the mainstream trends in global gold beneficiation. Gold ore has high mining value, and its beneficiation process is relatively complex, and the beneficiation process and equipment are not the same.
