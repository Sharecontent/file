## NGOs file complaint before OECD, demand closure of Cerrejón coal mine 
Cerrejón is an integrated mining and transportation complex in Colombia's La Guajira province, in the northeastern part of the country, which includes an open-pit mine, a 150-kilometres railway line and a Caribbean port. In 2020, the mine produced 12.4 million tonnes of coal, almost 50% less than the output it registered the year before.

## open pit coal mining equipments
Open-Pit vs. Strip Mining. Strip mining is a surface technique where workers clear vegetation, waste rock, and overburden from the ground. Typically, miners use these operations for extracting rock and coal from just below the surface. Open-pit mining differs as workers excavate large landscapes on deeper slopes, separated by "benches."
