## grinding process in copper production
12.3 Primary Copper Smelting. Process steps include mining, concentration, roasting, smelting, converting, and finally fire and electrolytic refining. Mining produces ores with less than 1 percent copper. Concentration is accomplished at the mine sites by crushing, grinding, and flotation purification, resulting in ore with 15 to 35 percent copper.
