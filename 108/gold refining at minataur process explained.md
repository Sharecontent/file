## metallurgy - Refining | Britannica
Refining is the final procedure for removing (and often recovering as by-products) the last small amounts of impurities left after the major extraction steps have been completed. It leaves the major metallic element in a practically pure state for commercial application. The procedure is accomplished in three ways: refining by fire, by electrolytic, or by chemical methods. Iron, copper, and

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

## How the Gold Refining Process Works | Global Bullion
The Refining Process. Refiners start with one of two types of gold: a doré bar or scrap. Doré bars are produced by miners and are about 80 percent pure. Refiners increase the purity by separating the other precious metals and less precious metals that are mined with it. Using induction heating, doré bars and scrap are turned into molten metal.

## refining of gold by quartation
The two gold refining methods most commonly employed to derive pure gold are: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process uses gaseous chlorine to extract impurities when gold is at melting point; impurities separate into a layer on the surface of the molten purified gold.

## Gold Refining Process
The gold occurring in the alluvium is not refined by any of Nature's processes—but the accompanying minerals or metals are either oxidised or removed hence, in the recovery of gold from reefs impurities are often collected and introduced, thus making it of lower value than the corresponding alluvial gold, and also giving rise to erroneous

100 parts fused borax. 50 soda carbonate. 10 nitre. If the gold is very impure more nitre is added to this flux, a sample is taken to check the subsequent toughening, which is done either with chlorine or nitre until sufficient of the base metals is extracted to enable samples representative of the mass to be taken.

In gold processing: Refining monly employed for purification: the Miller process and the Wohlwill process. The Miller process is based on the fact that virtually all the impurities present in gold combine with gaseous chlorine more readily than gold does at temperatures equal to or greater than the melting point of gold.

(990 grams x 995 purity / 1000 = 985.05 pure gold). If you multiply 985.05 pure gold x 54.88 (current market price, per gram) = USD 54,059.54.
