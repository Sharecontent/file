Concrete is of course designed specifically for weight-bearing applications, such as for the building of foundations, beams, and other such things. When it comes down to it, concrete is much stronger than expanding foam. If you have a very heavy fence post, it might cause the expanding foam to warp or crack over time.

## Durability of crushed fine recycled aggregate concrete assessed by 
This paper presents some results for the durability of FRA concrete by assessing the materials' permeability properties. Different compositions were cast and tested for durability-related properties, such as water absorption by immersion, capillary absorption, carbonation, chloride penetration and electrical resistivity.

2. Grade of concrete is the characteristic cube strength. 3. For very sever conditions only air entrained concrete should be used. Effect of W/C Ratio on Durability: W/c ratio has a great impact on the durability of the concrete. Higher w/c ratio is the main cause of volume change and higher permeability of concrete.
