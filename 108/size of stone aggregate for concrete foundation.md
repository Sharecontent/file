## How to Choose Quality Coarse Aggregate for Concrete Construction?
The typical coarse aggregate size ranges from 4.75 mm to 18 mm. Gravel or broken stone aggregates with rough and non-glassy texture are the best aggregates because they create a good bond with the cement paste. Aggregates need to be hard, strong, chemically inert, and non-porous.

The usual range is between 9.5mm and 37.5mm in diameter. Fine aggregates are usually sand or crushed stone that are less than 9.55mm in diameter. Typically the most common size of aggregate used in construction is 20mm. A larger size, 40mm, is more common in mass concrete. Larger aggregate diameters reduce the quantity of cement and water needed.

## Concrete Mix Design: Understanding Aggregate - NPCA - Precast
Aggregate shape plays a key role in the function of freshly mixed concrete workability. According to American Concrete Institute, there are five categories of shape that describe concrete aggregates: angular, rounded, flaky, elongated and flaky/elongated. Aggregates with a round shape, such as sand and gravel from beaches or rivers, typically

## Aggregate placement under foundations - Foundation engineering - Eng-Tips
In Japan, it is typical to use a 50 mm thick layer of lean concrete on 150 mm thick layer of granular base aggregate. This allow also for putting markings on the lean concrete to guide rebar and forms installation. See attached photo. Under slabs, we just use a 150 mm ~ 300 mm granular base aggregate.

## Effect of Aggregate Size on Strength - Concrete Construction
A.: If the quantities of coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, cement and water are the same for both mixes, the mix with l l/2-inch aggregate will have greater slump and will probably bleed more. If both mixes are plastic the resulting strengths of the two mixes will probably be about the same. If, however, the two mixes are designed for the same
