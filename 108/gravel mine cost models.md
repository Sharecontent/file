## Common Types of Surface Mining Equipment - Sand & Gravel Basics
So, we'll go into some detail on each piece of equipment and where it fits into the mining process, and then follow up with some common hazards and safety tips. Common surface mining equipment at a sand and gravel mine can be categorized as follows: Earth Moving / Construction. Bull Dozers (Dozers) Backhoes. Graders / Scrapers. Cranes.
