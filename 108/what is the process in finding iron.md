## Ground water: Dealing with iron contamination - Filtration and Separation
Removing iron by oxidation and filtration. In cases of iron levels higher than 0.3 ppm, sequestration is not possible, and therefore the iron must be physically removed from the water.Removing dissolved iron is a two-stage process:• The first stage is oxidising the dissolved iron and transforming it from soluble form to insoluble ferric form

Iron is a critical part of haemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that binds oxygen in the lungs and releases it as blood travels to other parts of the body. Iron is also needed by other cells, especially muscle (which contains another oxygen binding protein called myoglobin). Low iron levels can lead to anaemia, in which the body does not

Iron is an essential mineral that is a part of hemoglobin which helps maintain your strength and energy. Your body needs iron to make new blood cells, replacing the ones lost through blood donations. There are things you can do to help maintain healthy iron levels: Eat a nutritious, well-balanced diet with foods rich in iron and high in vitamin C.

The formation of iron sulphide in a hot, flowing oil is believed to involve two processes: I) The corrosion of iron by organic acids and sulphur compounds. II) The decomposition of soluble iron salts. Two different mechanisms are considered for the reactions depending on the presence or absence of oxygen; here we consider only the latter case.
