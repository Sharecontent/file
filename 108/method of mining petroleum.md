## What is biomining? | American Geosciences Institute
Biomining is mineral processing with microbes. Biomining is the process of using microorganisms (microbes) to extract metals of economic interest from rock ores or mine waste. Biomining techniques may also be used to clean up sites that have been polluted with metals. Valuable metals are commonly bound up in solid minerals. Some microbes can oxidize those metals, allowing them to dissolve in

It requires the team to set up a tripod with a cable and the drill bit attached to its end. The drill goes to and fro in the hole to loosen the soil and reach a greater depth, which the workers later extract using a bailer.
