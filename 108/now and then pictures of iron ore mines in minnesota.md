produced from Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range iron ore. Modern Taconite Production. Iron ore is both mined and upgraded on Minnesota's Mesabi Iron Range. After being extracted from the ground, - low grade iron ore is hauled from open-pit mines to nearby taconite processing facilities, where it is crushed into a fine powder.

## ArcelorMittal and US Steel to idle Minnesota iron ore mines - SteelOrbis
Two major iron ore mines in the US will be idled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to local news reports.. ArcelorMittal USA will idle operations at its Hibbing Taconite mine in Minnesota as of May 3, with plans to reopen in July. About 650 workers will be laid off as a result. The mine produces around 7.8 million tons of iron ore pellets per year.

I guess during this time there was great concern about the lack of quality iron ore left in the strip mines and about the weather concerns. Iron Ore guy brushes those concerns off, and tells us even if there isn't high quality ore left, there's always the MEDIUM quiality ore. Very interesting artificact to be sure.

The boom times of iron ore mining in northern Minnesota are long gone, but mining operations continue and are even expanding, as seen in these Landsat images. The Mesabi Range, which stretches 80-100 miles from Grand Rapids to Babbitt, contributed about 60% of the total iron ore output in the United States throughout most of the 20th century.

As it turned out, the iron would become more valuable to northern Minnesota than the gold. Iron ore was discovered on the three iron ranges at different times. The first ore shipped from the Vermilion Range was in 1884, the Mesabi Range in 1892, and the Cuyuna Range in 1911. The mines were operated through the hard work of the miners.
