Placer Gold Mining Methods. The gold deposits grouped together under the name of " placers " comprise sands, gravels, or any loosely coherent or non-coherent alluvial beds containing gold. They have accumulated owing to the action of running water, in the beds of rivers, or on the adjoining inundation plains, or on sea beaches.
