## Design modification of iron ore bearing transfer chute using discrete 
The dryer feed chute of the pellet plant plays an important role in the pelletizing process. The chute discharges sticky and moist iron ore fines (<1 mm) to the inline rotary dryer for further processing. Since the inception of the installation of the dryer feed chute, the poor flowability of the feed materials has caused severe problems such as blockages and excessive wear of chute liners.

## Underground Ore Loading Chutes; Ore Chute Design
Finger chutes are suitable for handling coarse, blocky ore, and their chief advantage lies in the means afforded for removing large chunks, one at a time (by lifting one or more fingers separately), without causing a run of muck. They are relatively high in cost, cumbersome, and require considerable room for installation.

Iron Ore is an early-game ore that generates upon world creation on the surface, as well as in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is in crafting Iron Bars, which can then be used to craft the Iron tier of tools, weapons, and armor, as well as Buckets, Chains, and several other items.
