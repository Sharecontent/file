## Arsenic trioxide
Illustrative is the roasting of orpiment, a typical arsenic sulfide ore. 2 As 2 S 3 + 9 O 2 → 2 As 2 O 3 + 6 SO 2. Most arsenic oxide is, however, obtained as a volatile by-product of the processing of other ores. For example, arsenopyrite, a common impurity in gold- and copper-containing ores, liberates arsenic trioxide upon heating in air.

In the search for technologies for the extraction of gold from such ores, including those obtained from the Sayak-4 gold deposit, pyrometallurgical processing represents a possible direction. The results of an experimental study of the Reducing Pyrometallurgical Selection (RPS
