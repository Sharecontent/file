## Coal mining and transportation - Energy Information Administration
Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is necessary when the coal is several hundred feet below the surface. Some underground mines are thousands of feet deep with tunnels that may extend out from the vertical mine shafts for miles. Miners ride elevators down deep mine shafts and travel on small trains in long tunnels to get to the coal.

In-situ mining techniques can use less water than open-pit mining and underground mining, and also reduce the risk of releasing ore dust into the atmosphere.

## Ecosystem Changes Caused by Mining | Greentumble
Ecosystem Changes Caused by Mining. Mining is a destructive force that heavily modifies the surrounding ecosystem. It can be divided into two major categories based upon their excavation types. The first is surface mining which is by far the most common in the present day. The second kind is sub-surface mining which includes underground mining.
