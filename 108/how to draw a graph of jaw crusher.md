The size of a jaw crusher is measured by the top opening of the crushing chamber. For example, a 48" x 42" jaw crusher measures 48" from one crushing jaw to another and is 42" across the width of the two crushers. The primary applications for using jaw crushers are: Crushing different kinds of ore; Reducing building rubble to pieces
