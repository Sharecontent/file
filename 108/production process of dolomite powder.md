## Production of iron pdfsyhosting
Iron is produced inblast furnacesby the reduction of iron -bearing materials with a hot gas. The large, refractory-lined furnace is charged through its top with iron ore pellets (taconite), sinter, flux (limestone and dolomite), and coke, which provides the fuel and forms a reducing atmosphere in the furnace. Many modern 4 of 39.
