## Health effects of coal mining and combustion: carcinogens and cofactors 
There seems to be no reason to assume that a large increase in coal combustion in the future will by necessity lead to greater risks of cancer to the coal miners or the general urban dweller, because activities to be started now can take into consideration the requirements necessary for control of air pollution in mines as well as in cities.

Coal mining projections. By 2040, the percentage of coal in the power mix will decrease by about 10 percentage points from 38 to 28 percent. But at the same time world demand for energy will grow massively so MUCH more is needed to seriously reduce the damaging effects of coal mining - and turning the coal into energy.

## Petroleum coke in the urban environment: a review of potential health 
Abstract. Petroleum coke, or petcoke, is a granular coal-like industrial by-product that is separated during the refinement of heavy crude oil. Recently, the processing of material from Canadian oil sands in U.S. refineries has led to the appearance of large petcoke piles adjacent to urban communities in Detroit and Chicago.
