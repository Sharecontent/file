Gold occurs principally as a native metal, i.e., gold itself.Sometimes it is alloyed to a greater or lesser extent with silver, which is called electrum.Native gold can occur as sizeable nuggets, as fine grains or flakes in alluvial deposits, or as grains or microscopic particles (known as colour) embedded in rock minerals.Other forms of gold are the minerals calaverite (AuTe), aurostibnite

## Metal
Noble metals are resistant to corrosion or oxidation, unlike most base metals. They tend to be precious metals, often due to perceived rarity. Examples include gold, platinum, silver, rhodium, iridium, and palladium. In alchemy and numismatics, the term base metal is contrasted with precious metal, that is, those of high economic value.

The final gold product of Tau Lekoa mine has a low fineness. This is caused by high concentration of bases metals in the reefs. Some of these base metals together with gold are leached with cyanide and are loaded into carbon. If not adequately controlled, they may elute with gold and contaminate the final product in the electrowinning process.
