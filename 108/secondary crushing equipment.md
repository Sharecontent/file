## Designing a Crushing & Screening Plant - Part I. Primary Jaw Crushing Stage
The secondary crusher must have a larger intake and do more work. The same reasoning will then apply to the third stage where it also will be fed with a coarser feed. In the end, to reach the required plant reduction, an extra crushing stage will be needed just because the reduction in the primary stage is insufficient.
