## Solvay to phase out coal for energy use in Rheinberg soda ash plant 
Solvay S.A. (Brussels, Belgium) is announcing plans to completely phase out the use of thermal coal at its soda ash plant in Rheinberg, Germany.. After commissioning a first biomass boiler, which will go into operation in May 2021, Solvay is unveiling plans to build a second biomass boiler, which will complete the thermal coal phase-out by 2025 and make Rheinberg the first soda ash plant in
