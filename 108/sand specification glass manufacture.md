## Purity and Quality Sand for the Glass Product You Want - COVIA
Silica sand is essential to optimal glass production: the higher the purity of the sand, the more control you have over the strength, clarity, and color of the final product. Our extensive sand processing experience delivers consistent and predictable product chemistry so you can produce batches with limited variability.

## From sand to flat glass - Glass for Europe
The use of recycled glass (i.e. cullet) as an alternative to sand as a source of silicon dioxide (SiO 2) has proved to be an efficient way to reduce CO 2 emissions from flat glass manufacturing and virgin sand consumption; i.e. one tonne of recycled glass replaces 0.7 tonnes of virgin sand. Over the last decades, the European flat glass sector

Sand is critical to flat glass manufacturing since it is the principal source of silicon dioxide (SiO2) which is essential for producing glass [2].

## What Is Silica Sand & How Is It Different From Regular Sand?
Silica sand, also known as quartz sand, white sand, or industrial sand, is made up of two main elements: silica and oxygen. Specifically, silica sand is made up of silicon dioxide (SiO2). The most common form of SiO2 is quartz - a chemically inert and relatively hard mineral. SiO2 grades at a 7 out of 10 on Mohs hardness scale, making it

Glass, which has been made since the time of the Mesopotamians and Egyptians, is little more than a mixture of sand, soda ash and lime. When heated to about 1500 degrees Celsius (°C) this becomes a molten mass that hardens when slowly cooled. The first successful method for making clear, flat glass involved spinning.
