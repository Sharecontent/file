With a population of around 5,000 people or 1,650 families, Redi has also been a centre of iron ore mining in the Western Ghats. While mining has brought with it some economic prosperity, it has overwhelmingly negatively impacted the health of Redi's residents, and the overall ecology of this biodiverse region.

There are two principle types of surface mining, strip mining and open-pit mining (see Fig. 8.8). Strip mining is the process of mining a seam of mineral by removing a long strip of overlying soil and rock. Strip mining is a practical type of mining when the ore body that is to be extracted is near the surface.

For example, metallurgical coal is down 21 percent and thermal coal is down 23 percent, while gold is up 19 percent and iron ore is up 18 percent (Exhibit 2). Currencies in key mining countries were initially devalued by 10 to 30 percent; as a result, many mining jurisdictions became more cost competitive.

What are the environmental impacts of mining iron ore? The mining of iron ore is highly energy intensive and causes air pollution in the form of nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide from diesel generators, trucks and other equipment. The mining of iron ore also causes water pollution of heavy metals and acid that drains from the mines.

What Are Some Of The Effects Of Strip Mining? Strip mining destroys landscapes forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees plants and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams sediments pollute waterways.
