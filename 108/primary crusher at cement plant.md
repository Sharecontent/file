## Tips for designing an efficient crushing and screening operation
Hammermills are common in cement plants, where the top size of the primary crusher output must be a certain size for the next operation. Reduction ratios for this machine are typically 20:1. Hammermills are higher maintenance than the impact crusher due to the higher reduction ratios and the design of the machine.

Jaw crushers are mainly used as primary crushers to produce material that can be transported by belt conveyors to the next crushing stages. The crushing process takes place between a fixed jaw and a moving jaw. The moving jaw dies are mounted on a pitman that has a reciprocating motion. The jaw dies must be replaced regularly due to wear.
