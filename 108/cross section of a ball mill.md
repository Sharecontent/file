A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.

## Construction of Ball Mill | Henan Deya Machinery Co., Ltd.
A concept which has found some application for ball mills is the "angular spiral lining". The circular cross-section of a conventional mill is changed to a square cross-section with rounded corners by the addition of rubber-lined, flanged frames, which are offset to spiral in a direction opposite to the mill rotation.

## The discrete element method for the simulation of ball mills
A 55-cm ball mill is simulated for two different liner cross-sections— rectangular and triangular. Results of the simulations pertaining to applied torque are compared with the experiments. It is found that, with a particular model for the coefficient of friction, the predicted torque agrees well with the experiments.
