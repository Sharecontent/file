## Milling (machining)
Milling is the process of machining using rotary cutters to remove material by advancing a cutter into a workpiece.This may be done by varying direction on one or several axes, cutter head speed, and pressure. Milling covers a wide variety of different operations and machines, on scales from small individual parts to large, heavy-duty gang milling operations.

The starting point for ball mill media and solids charging generally starts as follows: 50% media charge. Assuming 26% void space between spherical balls (non-spherical, irregularly shaped and mixed-size media will increase or decrease the free space) 50% x 26% = 13% free space. Add to this another 10%-15% above the ball charge for total of 23%

## Dry Ball Mill Operation
Charging a Dry Mill - The general operation of a grinding mill is to have the product impacted between the balls as they tumble. If there are insufficient solids in the mill then the media will strike itself and generate excessive media wear. If too much product then the solid may buffer the impact too much.
