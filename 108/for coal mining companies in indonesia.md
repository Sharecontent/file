Indonesia has significant coal and mineral deposits, with the majority of Indonesia's mining exports being thermal coal. Indonesia's close proximity to the large energy-consumption nations of China, India, Japan and Korea, coupled with low-cost production, have resulted in Indonesia being ranked as one of the world's largest exporters of thermal coal.
