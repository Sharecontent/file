## Quartz | Common Minerals
Quartz was the mineral upon which the Stone Ages were based. With few exceptions, most early stone tools were fashioned of quartz. Outcrops of quartz that were suitable for tool manufacturing were targeted by some of the earliest known mining activities and the mined quartz was traded across vast distances, even before humans began to establish agricultural societies.

Quartz (SiO 2 or silicon dioxide) is crystalline silica, the second most common mineral in the crust of the earth. It is well known for its hardness and its use in glass. However, different types of glass require different SiO 2 purity levels with the most basic flat glass (e.g. house windows) only requiring SiO 2 purities of about 98.5%, while more complex glass such as solar glass or LCD

Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.
