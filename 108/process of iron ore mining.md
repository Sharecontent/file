## Problems and Solutions in Open Pit Iron Ore Mining - Mining-pedia
In the mining process of open pit iron ore, transportation is an important process to complete the mining task, and the workload accounted for by transportation is relatively large in the mining process. Usually in the open pit iron ore mining production will use electric shovel excavator to load the ore.

As with most iron ore mines throughout the world, all the major Australian iron ore mines are open cut.  Sintering is a process used to agglomerate iron ore fines in preparation for blast-furnace smelting and is usually carried out at iron and steelmaking centres. It involves the incorporation of crushed limestone, coke and other additives
