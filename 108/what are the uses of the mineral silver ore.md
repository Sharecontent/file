Silver is a soft, malleable metal. Its color is used to describe the colors of just about every other metal. Silver is stable in water and air, but sulfur compounds in air cause a black tarnish to appear. Silver will react with acids and bases. Humans have been using silver as far back as 3000 B.C.E. for jewelry, mirrors and silverware.

Silver can be found pure, but it's also usually mixed with gold, antimony, and arsenic. It has the highest optical reflective quality of any metal, which makes it very useful for solar energy. It's also used in making mirrors. Silver is a very resistant mineral and does not dissolve in most solvents. It also won't react to water or oxygen.
