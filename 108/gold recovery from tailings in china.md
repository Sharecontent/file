## Gold mine tailings, the treasure place of recovery gold-xinhai
The suitable reagents selected helped improve the recovery rate, and owner obtained 4000g gold from 120, 000 tons gold tailings. After extracting gold, Xinhai recovered sodium cyanide in pulp to eliminate the toxicity of pulp. The next step is tailings dry stacking to recover water from pulp.

The discharge from the tube mill is first passed through a 4-mesh screen to separate out coarse material, which is laundered direct to the classifier. The remainder of the pulp, diluted to give a W/S ratio of 1/1, passes to a Denver " Sub-A" Flotation Cell, from which 60% of the gold and silver in the feed is removed as a concentrate.

## China's Gold Market Continues to Recover | SchiffGold
Chinese gold imports have nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels and the world's biggest gold market continues to recover.. According to the latest data reported by the World Gold Council, China imported 67.6 tons of gold in May. That was 65 tons higher than May 2020 and only three tons lower than May 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic gripped the country.

## Gold cyanidation
Gold cyanidation (also known as the cyanide process or the MacArthur-Forrest process) is a hydrometallurgical technique for extracting gold from low-grade ore by converting the gold to a water-soluble coordination complex.It is the most commonly used leaching process for gold extraction. Cyanidation is also widely used in the extraction of silver, usually after froth flotation.

A gold extraction of 75% after leaching and a recovery of 90% Au after purification (adsorption-desorption-electrodeposition cycle) was obtained, while the overall process achieved a recovery of 65-67% Au [ 8 ].

## Tailings
In mining, tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden, which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.. The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining, which
