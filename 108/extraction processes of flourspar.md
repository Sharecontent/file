## Extraction of Lead
The flotation process collects the sulfur-bearing portions of the ore, which also contains the valuable metal. • First, the finely crushed ore is diluted with water and then poured into a tank called a flotation cell. The ground ore and water mixture is called slurry.  It is an example of liquid-liquid extraction. • The process takes

Fluorspar is the predominant commercial source for the chemical element fluorine. Fluorine is a non-metallic element and the lightest of the halogens and therefore largely irreplaceable in its use. There are two principal commercial grades of fluorspar: Metallurgical grade (60-96% CaF2) and acid grade (+97% CaF2).

## What Is Extraction? - the Theory and How It's Applied to Food
Extraction is an example of a separation technique. It can split two components, separate them apart. Imagine you have a mixture of components A and B (for example orange zest (A) with flavours inside (B), or a vanilla bean pod (B) with vanilla flavour (A)). We'd like to take B out of A. However, A and B are very well mixed, we can't wait

The reaction of fluorspar (CaF2) and sulphuric acid yields hydrofluoric acid. CaF2 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + 2HF. Treatment of chloroform, obtained by reacting methanol and chlorine, with the hydrofluoric acid yields monochlorodifluoromethane, also used as a refrigerant, which is a gas boiling at −40.8°C. CHCl3 + 2HF → CHClF2 + 2HCl.
