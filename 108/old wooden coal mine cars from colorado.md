## Hastings, Colorado & the Worst Mining Accident - Legends of America
On the morning of April 27, 1917, 122 men went into the Hastings No. 2 coal mine to work. At about 6:30 a.m., a fire boss had inspected the mine to make sure it was clear of any methane gas or other hazards. After the mine was cleared, work began as usual, and the miners began hauling coal to the surface utilizing wooden cars and a single cable.

The Advent of Industrial Coal. The earliest coal mining in Colorado took place in the late 1850s near the fledgling town of Denver, but industrial development of the state's coal resources awaited the arrival of William Jackson Palmer in the late 1860s.
