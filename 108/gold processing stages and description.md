## The Gold Smelting Process - Melting, Smelting & Refining 
The process produces gold of up 99.5% purity. A repeat of the process may further improve the purity of gold produced by this method. Gold smelting is an important process in the production of gold. It enables gold miners to separate impurity materials from pure gold that is desirable in the market. Smelting often produces gold to the purity

Gold, recognizable by its yellowish cast, is one of the oldest metals used by humans. As far back as the Neolithic period, humans have collected gold from stream beds, and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 B.C., when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry, religious artifacts, and utensils such as goblets.

A slurry of ground ore, water and a weak cyanide solution is fed into large steel leach tanks where the gold and silver are dissolved. following this leaching process the slurry passes through six adsorption tanks containing carbon granules which adsorb the gold and silver. this process removes 93 of the gold and 70 of the silver.

## Recovering Gold through the Froth Flotation Process
Pre-19th century placer mining operations used mercury to dissolve the gold in crushed ore, making it easier to recover. Later innovations include the MacArthur-Forrest Process and borax flux extraction. However, one of the most interesting methods is froth flotation. Froth flotation works by exploiting the hydrophobic properties of gold molecules.
