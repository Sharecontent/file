## Bauxite Mining - My Life In Transition
Moreover, soil in bauxite mines have high levels of Al (as bauxite ore is essentially Al2O3, Fe2O3and SiO2), limiting the growth of microbes in soil. Without microbiological activity, nutrients are not released into soil, restricting plant growth in acidic soil. This prevents post-mining biological land reclamation.

Jul 16, 2022By 1957 Jamaica had become the leading bauxite producer in the world, producing nearly 5 million tonnes of bauxite per year which was almost a quarter of all the bauxite mined in the world in that year. In 1959, a second refinery was built by Alcan at Ewarton, St Catherine, Jamaica. In 1961, a fourth company, Alcoa, began mining bauxite in Jamaica.

## Why Is Bauxite Important - Realonomics
What makes bauxite special? It is a rock composed mainly of aluminum-bearing minerals. It forms when laterite soils are severely leached of silica and other soluble materials in a wet tropical or subtropical climate. Bauxite is the primary ore of aluminum. Almost all of the aluminum that has ever been produced has been extracted from bauxite.

Apr 24, 2022This is because "dry-weight" means that the extracted soils were kiln-dried to retain only 13 per cent moisture. Whhen extracted, Jamaica's bauxitic soils have a natural free-moisture content of 20-30 per cent. Drying reduces the weight of dirt to be shipped. Thus, bauxite mining removes water from the environment.

But bauxite mining -- the island's second largest foreign exchange earner after tourism-- is considered to be the single largest cause of deforestation in Jamaica. On the one hand, this activity destroys large areas of forest because bauxite is extracted by open cast mining, which requires the complete removal of vegetation and topsoil.

It is important to note that 100% smelting of all bauxite domestically mined would have amounted to annual production of about 365,000 tons of aluminum for Guyana, or the annual output of one medium-sized smelter. Due to Jamaica's much larger bauxite production, however, annual aluminum output would average over two million tons.
