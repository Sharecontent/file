## Laboratory Jaw Crusher Pulverisette 1 | Laval Lab
The Laboratory Jaw Crusher Pulverisette 1 is recommended for intermittent or continuous pre-crushing of coarse materials. The maximum feed size is approximately 60 mm (model I) or 95 mm (model II). The maximum throughput is. 140 kg/h (model I) or 200 kg/h (model II). The optimum fineness depends on the gap width adjustment for setting the

## How to Choose a Rock Crusher - Sepro Aggregates
Round rock. Sand and gravel. Limestone. Sepro also creates jaw crushers for recycling applications. The 30Ã62 Grizzly King Jaw Crusher size is designed with recycling in mind. Gradation is less of a focus with this jaw crusher size, instead intended to run less aggressively to prevent the crusher from catching heavy steel.

## Jaw Crushers - high quality and reliability from RETSCH
The crushing ratio of a jaw crusher results from the maximum achievable final fineness in relation to the maximum feed size. For Retsch jaw crushers, this lies between 12.5 and 220. A high value reflects the capacity of a jaw crusher to accept large sample pieces and provide powerful crushing performance, resulting in high final fineness.
