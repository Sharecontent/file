Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

Erosion corrosion is a combination of actions. Corrosion results in an oxide on a metal's surface. The oxide, though, slows the attack because it prevents fresh corrodent from reaching the surface. If there's a fast fluid flow that scrubs the oxide off the surface, corrosion continues at a very rapid rate.

## What happens when acid reacts with limestone? | Questions | Naked 
Yes, limestone reacts with acids. Limestone is calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Carbonates react with acids according to the equation: However, the rate of the reaction will be determined by a number of factors. First, the strength of the acid.

Corrosion is the deterioration of a material due to chemical interaction with its environment. It is natural process in which metals convert its structure into a more chemically-stable form such as oxides, hydroxides, or sulfides. The consequences of corrosion are all too common. Familiar examples include the rusting of automotive body panels
