## Explain the Difference Between Manufactured Sand And Plaster Sand 
slide 3: M sand is manufactured by crushing hard stones P sand is made of hard granite stone. The demand for m sand is higher than P sand due to the rapid growth of industrialization. P sand can strengthen buildings and walls and m sand is used as river sand to make any construction work efficiently. P sand can be used for preparing concrete

## Multi-scale creep analysis of river sand and manufactured sand concrete 
Aug 15, 2022The difference in long-term creep performance between river sand concrete and manufactured sand concrete was obtained. • The thickness, creep performance, and volume ratio of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around river sand and manufactured sand were determined and compared.
