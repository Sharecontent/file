The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill, similar to the grinding balls in a ball mill. To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling, the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6. Rod mills accept feed up to about 50 mm (2 in.) and produce a product in the size range of 3000 to 270 mm (-4 to -35 mesh).

The reason why rod mill is called rod mill is that its grinding medium is steel rod, while the grinding medium of ball grinding mill is steel ball. Because the shape of the grinding media is different, the working mode has its own characteristics. When the steel rod is in motion, the gap between the rods is a regular long strip, which plays a

## mill grinding rod usage
The main usage of rod mill: it is widely used in grinding a variety of ores, such as quartz sand and tungsten ore grinding process to prevent excessive grinding. In the two-stage grinding process, grinding rod mill can be used in the first stage, when rod mill have large capacity and high efficiency.
