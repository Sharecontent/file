## Coal Mine Water Drainage: The Current Status and Challenges
Any form of mining is a potential threat to the environment. The extent of environmental degradation depends on the status of mine (working/abandoned), type of deposit, mining and processing methods and the geo-atmospheric conditions. Coal mining has huge impacts to local water resources, both surface and ground water. Surface waters are being contaminated through the discharge of mine water
