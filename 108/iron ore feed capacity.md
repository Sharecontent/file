The ore is mined in four bodies and is sent to processing in the Central Plant (wet route) or the Mobile Plants (dry route), located near extraction areas. Casa de Pedra currently has a production capacity of 30 million tons per year. Products resulting from the beneficiation process are grain, sinter feed and pellet feed.
