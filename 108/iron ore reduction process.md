## From Ore to Iron with Smelting and Direct Iron Reduction - GlobalSpec
In the smelting reduction process, pelletized iron oxide ore or fine ore powders are pre-reduced in a fluidized bed or reduction shaft. The reduced iron along with coal and lime is fed to a gasifier-melter, which completes the reduction process and produces pig iron or hot metal of the same quality as a blast furnace. The reducing gases

But this does not always mean that complete reduction to metallic iron is achieved faster in H2 than in CO for all iron ore materials. In the case of magnetite the reduction process actually ceases before complete reduction is achieved. Paradoxically, this is due to the very strong reducing effect of hydrogen gas.

The shaft furnace is the heart of the DR process. Therein, descending iron ore pellets are reduced and cooled yielding the cold DRI product. The reducing gas enters the shaft furnace at an intermediate position, ascends in the furnace and realizes the iron ore reduction before exiting at the top of the furnace.

Primary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods. The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter. At high temperatures, oxygen is blown through the metal, which reduces the carbon content to between 0-1.5%.

## The Direct Reduction of Iron Ore - JSTOR
The iron ore from which iron and steel are made is an oxide, that is, a chemi­ cal compound of iron (Fe) and oxy­ gen (0). Common forms of ore are hematite (Fe20a) and magnetite (Fea04)' For the ore to be made into iron the oxygen atoms must be separated from the iron atoms by the process known as reduction.

Blast furnace smelting is the continuous production process of reducing iron ore into pig iron. Solid raw materials such as iron ore, coke and flux are fed into the blast furnace in batches by the top charging device and maintained at a certain height. Coke and ore form alternating stratified structure in the furnace.

Energiron direct reduction process (HYL process) uses a shaft reduction furnace to produce DRI. It is designed to convert iron pellet/lump ore into metallic iron by the use of reducing gases in a solid-gas moving bed shaft furnace. O2 is removed from the iron ore by chemical reactions based on H2 and CO, for the production of highly metallized DRI.

## Using Iron Ore Ultra-Fines for Hydrogen-Based Fluidized Bed Direct 
Jun 1, 2022This mathematical evaluation focuses on iron ore ultra-fines for their use in a novel hydrogen-based fluidized bed direct reduction process. The benefits of such a process include reduced CO 2 emissions and energy consumption per ton of product, lower operational and capital expenditure, and a higher oxide yield. Typical samples of iron ore ultra-fines, such as pellet feed, are given and
