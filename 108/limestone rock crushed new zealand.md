## Limestone - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand
Limestone. Limestone, a sedimentary rock abundant in New Zealand, consists mainly of the bones and shells of tiny marine fossils made of lime (calcium carbonate). Rocks with more than 50% calcium carbonate are considered to be limestone. Most New Zealand limestone deposits formed in the Oligocene and Miocene periods, 5-37 million years ago.

The major limestone-forming period in New Zealand was during the Oligocene, about 22-30 million years ago. At that time, New Zealand was covered almost entirely by a shallow sea. Many invertebrate organisms with calcareous shells thrived in this sea, and over time, a thick sedimentary layer of shell fragments developed.
