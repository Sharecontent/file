## Rock Gold Processing Plant
Rock gold processing plant is the most efficient method to separate and recovery the old in rock gold mine. The recovery rate can be more than 95% after using gravity concentration and gold CIL (carbon in leaching) ways. The most single coarse gold ore can be separated by the gravity concentration, the fine gold and some gold tailings can be

Extraction of gold. A common method of gold extraction is to dissolve the gold ore in an alkaline solution of cyanide. In any case, for the environmental protection of the workplace, the storage and disposal of the reagents should be seriously considered. The waste slag after gold extraction can be disposed of together with flotation tailings.

The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.
