Dewatering is an important process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue.

Abstract: Operation performance of mineral grinding processes is measured by the grinding product particle size and the circulating load, as two of the most crucial operational indices that measure the product quality and operation efficiency, respectively. In this paper, a data-driven method is proposed for the operational control design of mineral grinding processes with input constraints.
