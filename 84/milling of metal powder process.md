## Making Metal Powder - MPIF
Oxide-reduced powders are often characterized as "spongy," due to pores present within individual particles. Solution-precipitated powders can provide narrow particle size distributions and high purity. Thermal decomposition is most often used to process carbonyls. These powders, once milled and annealed, exceed 99.5% purity.
