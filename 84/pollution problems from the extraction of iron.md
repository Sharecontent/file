## Iron Extraction by Blast Furnace Metallurgy - VEDANTU
In this reduction reaction, oxygen is removed from the iron (III) oxide to leave behind iron. Generally, the extraction of metals and their isolation are based on three major procedures. The steps are: 1. Concentration of Ore. 2. Extraction of metal from concentrated ore and. 3. Purification of the metal.

## Extraction of Iron - Class 12, General Principles and Processes of 
Extraction of Iron. The cast iron is usually extracted from its oxide ore (haematite). This process involves the following steps: 1) Concentration. The ore is crushed in jaw crushers and is broken to small pieces of about 1 inch in size. The crushed ore is concentrated by gravity separation process in which it is washed with water to remove
