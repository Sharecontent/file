## Mining Industry Profile | Department of Energy
Minerals are mined either underground or through surface methods like open-pit mining. Approximately 66% of coal and 97% of non-fuel minerals are extracted through surface mining methods. Both mining methods go through a process involving three general stages. The first stage is extraction, which includes blasting and drilling to loosen and

By Edmund Duncan May 31, 2022. Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surface â€”sometimes as far as 300 meters (1,000 feet). Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine, and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above

What is the process of cleaning coal? The majority of coal cleaning processes use upward currents or pulses of a fluid such as water to fluidize a bed of crushed coal and impurities. The lighter coal particles rise and are removed from the top of the bed. The heavier impurities are removed from the bottom.

## Coal mining
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Coal is valued for its energy content and since the 1880s has been widely used to generate electricity. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. In the United Kingdom and South Africa, a coal mine and its structures are a colliery, a coal mine is called a 'pit

## Coal mining - World Coal Association
The coal industry takes the issue of safety very seriously; modern coal mines have rigorous safety procedures, health and safety standards and worker education and training. Methane released from the coal seam and surrounding rock strata during mining can present a high risk of explosion at concentrations in air of 5-15%.

Coal is formed from the physical and chemical alteration of peat. Peat is composed of plant materials that accumulate in wetlands ( bogs and fens), which break down through the process of peatification. If peats are buried, then the peats can be altered into different ranks of coal through the process of coalification.

## How is coal formed? - Coal Education
Coal formed millions of years ago when the earth was covered with huge swampy forests where plants - giant ferns, reeds and mosses - grew. As the plants grew, some died and fell into the swamp waters. New plants grew up to take their places and when these died still more grew. In time, there was thick layer of dead plants rotting in the swamp.

Coal production continues to grow globally due to the demand for low cost energy and iron and steel, as well as cement. Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.

Open-pit mining. Some 53% of South Africa's coal is produced from surface mining, via open-cast or open-pit mines. This is because the coal is less than 60 metres below the surface. Open-pit mines use draglines, as well as truck and shovel operations to extract coal. A dragline excavator uses a dragline to pull a bucket by a wire cable.
