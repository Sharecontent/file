## Production process and main equipment of cement plant
The production process of cement is simply two grinding and one sintering, that is, raw materials are mined, crushed, ground and mixed to produce raw materials. Raw materials are fired at 1450 ~ C high temperature to produce clinker. Clinker is crushed and ground together with gypsum or other mixed materials to become cement.

Mix together the cement, sand and aggregate really well until you've got a finished dry mix. After you've made your dry batch, start adding water. Mix in the water until all your concrete is wet but there isn't any freestanding water. Too little water leaves unmixed powder and too much makes things soupy.
