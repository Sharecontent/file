## Types and features of rotary kiln
The advantages and disadvantages of dry type rotary kiln and wet type rotary kiln are opposite. The dry type production is to make the raw materials to dry powders and the water content is generally lower than 1%, for this reason, it can reduce the heat needed for vaporizing the water compared with wet type production.
