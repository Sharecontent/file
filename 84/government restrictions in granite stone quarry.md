## Mineral Mining and Processing Effluent Guidelines | US EPA
Mine operators extract minerals from underground mines, surface mines and quarries using machinery and explosives. Some extraction processes, such as stone quarries, may use large quantities of water. After extraction, many types of raw minerals are then subject to processes such as crushing, milling, washing and chemical treatments.
