## Experimental investigation on concrete by replacing crusher dust as 
Abstract In this present work we identified and investigated the use of crusher dust and granite floor slab chips in concrete as an alternative fine aggregate and coarse aggregate respectively, the tests were conducted on standard concrete cubes (150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm), cylinders (150 mm x 300 mm) and prisms (100 mm x 100 mm x 500 mm).
