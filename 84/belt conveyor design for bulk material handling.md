## Sandwich Belt High Angle Conveyors
A sandwich belt conveyor uses two conveyor belts, face-to-face, to gently but firmly contain the product being carried, hence making steep incline and even vertical-lift runs easily achievable. The DSI Snake hugs the bulk materials by the use of radial pressure which is due to the belt tension and the alternating curving profile geometry.

As a manufacturer and system partner, the BEUMER Group designs both machines (e.g. pendulum bucket elevators and belt conveyors) and complete solutions for the conveying of raw materials on their way to be processed further.

## Belt Conveyor System Manufacturer | Bulk Material Handling
Belt conveyors can be used to stock-pile or reclaim bulk materials. Radial stackers are used for creating large piles of materials such as wood chips, coal or ore. Reclaim belt conveyors are located under the piles to carry the materials into the plant for processing. Belt conveyors require less horsepower to operate than other types of conveyors.

## The most efficient conveying technologies for bulk material handling.
The first conveyor we will discuss is the belt conveyor. Belt conveyors greatest advantages are in distance, and carrying material for miles, from mines and pits, into processing facilities. Another advantage to belt conveyors is that they have high capacity rating. This means they are capable of handling a high volume of material at faster speeds.
