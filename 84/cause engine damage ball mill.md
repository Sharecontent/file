Jan 17, 2022This causes the density of the ball mill to climb. Which in turn is discharged back to the cyclone. If now, you go back through the circuit, and check your variables you will notice that the rod mill density has increased. The grind has gotten worse. The cyclone over flow density and the ball mill density has gotten heavier.

Conical Ball Mills differ in mill body construction, which is composed of two cones and a short cylindrical part located between them (Fig. 2.12).Such a ball mill body is expedient because efficiency is appreciably increased. Peripheral velocity along the conical drum scales down in the direction from the cylindrical part to the discharge outlet; the helix angle of balls is decreased and
