## Limestone and dolomite - Earth Resources
Jun 2, 2021Younger limestones tend to be friable and porous, whereas older limestones are often dolomitised and silicified, or metamorphosed and recrystallised to marble. Victorian Palaeozoic limestones and dolomites were formed in marine settings, whereas Tertiary limestones were formed in a range of subaqueous and subaerial environments. Limestone uses

## sedimentary rock - Limestones and dolomites | Britannica
Limestones and dolomites are collectively referred to as carbonates because they consist predominantly of the carbonate minerals calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite (CaMg[CO3]2). Almost all dolomites are believed to be produced by recrystallization of preexisting limestones, although the exact details of this dolomitization process continue to be debated. Consequently, the following discussion

## Formula for dolomitic limestone?idegrillandbar
Is dolomite older than limestone? Dolomite rocks are important oil reservoir rocks because average dolomite has usually higher porosity than limestone. Dolomite rock is a very common sedimentary rock, especially older carbonate rocks (formed before the Mesozoic) tend to be dolomites whereas younger carbonates are predominantly various limestones.

## Limestone vs Dolomite: What Are They, And What's The Difference?
Limestone is an occurring type of sedimentary carbonate rock found on Earth's surface. It is formed when crystals of calcium carbonate precipitate out of water containing dissolved calcium. Limestone is composed of minerals such as calcite and aragonite. Limestone consists of 80 percent calcite and Dolomite with more than 50% calcium carbonate.
