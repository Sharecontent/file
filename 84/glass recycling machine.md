Cullet or domestic glass is the most common type of glass used for bottles of wine, beer, soda, juice and glass jars that we use everyday. Throwing them away instead of recycling would greatly hurt our environment. Any efforts we make to reduce the amount of glass waste in our landfills and oceans helps tremendously.
