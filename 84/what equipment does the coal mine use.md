## Learn About Wyoming Coal Mining.
Coal. Wyoming, the nation's leading coal producer since 1986, provides about 40% of America's coal through the top 10 producing mines located in the Powder River Basin. Most Wyoming coal is sub-bituminous, which makes it an attractive choice for power plants because it has less sulfur and burns at around 8,400 to 8,800 BTUs per pound.

Large opencast mines can cover an area of many square kilometres and use very large pieces of equipment, such as draglines, power shovels, large trucks, bucket wheel excavators and conveyors. What is the impact on the land? Coal mining is only a temporary use of land, so it is vital that mine rehabilitation takes place once operations have stopped.

## What is coal used for? | U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

Longwall Miner. Twenty percent to 30 percent of mined coal underground is from longwall mining. This is performed by a mechanical cutter that shears coal off from a panel on the seam. The panel being worked on may be up to 800 feet in width and 7,000 feet in length. Mined coal is deposited onto a conveyor that moves the coal to a collection area.

If you are interested in how does coal produce electricity step by step, the steps are the following: A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder. The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burnt. more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace. The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam.

## What is the process of collecting coal? - PostVines
Underground mining, sometimes called deep mining, is a process that retrieves coal from deep below the Earth's surfaceâ€”sometimes as far as 300 meters (1,000 feet). Miners travel by elevator down a mine shaft to reach the depths of the mine, and operate heavy machinery that extracts the coal and moves it above ground.

Coring ( diamond drilling) is another way of collecting information about a potential coal resource. The drill rig is equipped with a hollow tube, and as the drill pushes the rods into the ground, a cylindrical piece of the rock is pushed into the hollow tube. These samples are usually the length of a drill rod, which is 6 meters.
