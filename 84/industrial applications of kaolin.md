Kaopaque 10S is a pre-dispersed, delaminated kaolin produced from a water-fractionated feed with a carefully controlled particle size and platy shape. The plate-like structure provides barrier properties in many applications, such as good enamel holdout, stain resistance, and washability in interior emulsion paint systems.

## Chapter 5 Kaolin Applications - ScienceDirect
Kaolin is one of the more important industrial clay minerals. Kaolin is comprised predominantly of the mineral kaolinite, a hydrated aluminum silicate. As noted in Chapter 2, other kaolin minerals are dickite, nacrite, and halloysite. Dickite and nacrite are rather rare and usually are found mixed with kaolinite in deposits of hydrothermal origin.
