## Conveyor Belt Transition Zones - Martin Eng
A standard rule of thumb is the transition distance should be at least 2.5 to 3 times the width of the belt when in a flattened profile. One of the most destructive forms of belt damage is Junction Joint Failure. This damage is caused by forcing the conveyor belt into a troughing angle sooner than the belt is designed to accept it.
