## How Vibrating Motors Work and How to Choose The Suitable Electric Motor.
Stepper motor vibrating are used for applications requiring vibration such as cell phones or game controllers. They are generated by an electric motor and have an unbalanced mass on the drive shaft which causes the vibration. They can also be used in non-electronic buzzers that vibrate for the purpose of sound or for alarms or door bells.
