## Lead in Ceramic Glazes - Digitalfire
Lead is a melter in ceramic glazes and performs exceptionally well at low temperatures. In fact it makes very low fired terra cotta ware possible in many countries (that would otherwise be impossible). It is available in frits so the raw lead oxides can be completely avoided, thus greatly reducing the exposure experienced by production personal.

Heat-induced (at temperatures > 200 °C) transformation of low-charge smectite (montmorillonite ) to high-charge smectite (a.k.a. beidellization) is frequently observed as the first step in transformation of smectite -to-illite

Clay is generally formed from the way-prehistoric decomposition of rocks, most notably granite. (Way-prehistoric means 50 million, give or take, years ago.) Therefore it contains the various volcanic minerals that made up the granite. Since lead was basically never in that volcanic source material, there is rarely a clay that contains lead.

## Basics of Clay Minerals and Their Characteristic Properties
1.2 Clay minerals. Clay minerals are the characteristics minerals on the earth found near planetary surface (the surface where the outer crust of the object comes in contact with atmosphere) environment with variable amount of ions like iron, magnesium, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and other cations.
