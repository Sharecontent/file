## How cement was created?
The raw material for cement is limestone. What is the difference between concrete and cement? Cement is a powdery, dry substance that is mixed with water, sand, and gravel to create concrete. Why is there a cement shortage? There is a cement shortage because the construction industry is booming and there is not enough cement to keep up with demand.

## Determination Of Limestone Quality In Cement Production
Limestone is the key raw materials for the cement making industry where chemical properties are important. Portland cement is produced by the calcination of finely ground raw mixture of limestone and clay (Bouazza et al, 2016). Cement industry is major player for the construction of infrastructures in the development of any country.

Limestone and clay are extracted from rock quarries thanks to the modern technology employed. Transporting the raw material: Once the materials have been fragmented, they are transported to the plant in dump trucks or by conveyor belts.; Crushing: The quarry stone is delivered through chutes to the crushers, where it is reduced by crushing or pounding to chunks approximately 1 1/2 inches in size.
