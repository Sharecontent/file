Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

Iron ore is a rock or mineral from which metallic iron can be extracted economically. It constitutes 5% of the earth's crust. Viable forms of ore contain between 25% and 60% iron.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## Brown Iron Ore Mining - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
The iron oxide minerals occur as hard boulders, tabular ore, pipe ore, and ocher. The brown-iron deposits at the Sawyer and Fore mines are of secondary type. Both are on or near the tops of broad ridges. The deposits at the Sawyer mine are in two parallel, north-south trending troughs in residual material resting on the Roubidoux formation (fig

## Brief Introduction on Iron Ore Mines Mining Process - Xinhai
The iron ore mine mining process of this kind of iron ore mine is the most complicated one. Generally, the combined process of weak magnetic separation and other methods is adopted, that is, using the weak magnetic separation to the recover the magnetite, the gravity separation, flotation or strong magnetic separation to recover the weak
