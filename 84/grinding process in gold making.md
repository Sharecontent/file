## gold processing | Britannica
gold processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value. These images are derived from two properties of gold, its colour and its chemical stability. The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom, which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms

Gold smelting flux helps us to take advantage of this fact in the smelting process. Flux is able to react only with the impure metals, thereby causing them to form nitrates which can separate out neatly. Again, smelting flux makes metallic oxides easy to eliminate, thereby removing another major source of impurity.

## How to optimise the wet grinding process for paint production - Oliver
The wet grinding process occurs when a product is transformed from solid to liquid, regardless of its viscosity: paints, inks, enamels, nail varnish, among others. In this process, agglomerates that were not separated in the dispersion phase (due to the electro-physical bonding of some components) are broken by applying extra energy.. This wet grinding process uses beads or micro beads, which
