Feb 07, 2006 Â· Blueschists are found only in rocks formed during the last 120 million years, and therefore are restricted in Canada to the Cordillera. Eclogites are also generally restricted to relatively young rocks, with the world's only occurrence of Archean (more than 2.5 billion years old) eclogites being discovered recently in the

## Why Are Fossils Found in Sedimentary Rocks and Not Igneous?
Fossils are rarely found in igneous rocks because the sedimentation process that creates fossils produces sedimentary rocks. Igneous rocks form from cooling lava, and fossils can not exist within them, because the lava would melt the organism, so it would be longer be present to fossilize. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks, where the

## How Old Are Sedimentary Rocks - Realonomics
Sedimentary rocks such as sandstone are created by the compression of sediment or particles. . The oldest whole rocks found so far date back about 4.28 billion years. How long ago was sedimentary rock formed? This process is called cementation. These processes eventually make a type of rock called sedimentary rock.

## Where are the most sediments and sedimentary rocks found?
Chemical sedimentary rocks can be found in many places, from the ocean to deserts to caves. For instance, most limestone forms at the bottom of the ocean from the precipitation of calcium carbonate and the remains of marine animals with shells.

Sedimentary rocks are formed from deposits of pre-existing rocks or pieces of once-living organism that accumulate on the Earth's surface. If sediment is buried deeply, it becomes compacted and cemented, forming sedimentary rock. These rocks often have distinctive layering or bedding and create many of the picturesque views of the desert southwest.

## How Does A Sedimentary Rock Turn Into A Metamorphic Rock??
Metamorphic rocks: form by recrystallization of either igneous or sedimentary rocks. This happens when the temperature pressure or fluid environment change and a rock changes its form (e.g. limestone turns to marble). The range of temperatures for metamophism is 150C up to the melting temperature.

Why are fossils only found in sedimentary rocks? The reason you only see fossils in sedimentary rock is that these set of rocks are formed in much lower pressure and temperature compared to other rock types. The pressure and temperature are quite low to the extent that they do not destroy the remains of dead plants and animals buried in the rock.
