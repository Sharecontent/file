## Black Powder Making for the Survivalist - Survival Sullivan
To make your own black powder at home, you need only 3 fairly easy to obtain ingredients. You can buy a 5 pound bag of 99.8% pure ammonium nitrate for $14 and a 1 pound bag of sulfur for $2.99 online at dudadiesel. Then just make your own charcoal. Activated charcoal isn't really good for making black powder.

At this point, a black powder green meal with a reasonable degree of homogeneity has been achieved. Now a volume of green meal equal to 25% of the mill jar volume is measured. For this jar, that volume is 3 and 1/4 cups of our bulk green meal. This is the first approximation to the theoretically ideal mill jar charge.

## Black Powder - GardenBallistics
Making black powder is more complex than simply mixing the three ingredients together. This is in fact called green powder or polverone which burns slowly and inefficiently leaving lots of un-burnt solids behind. Proper black powder is mixed thoroughly to a fine powder using a ball mill or with other non-sparking grinding media.

## Making Black Powder with a Ball Mill - Skylighter, Inc.
To grind a single chemical (vs. a mix like black powder) using a ball mill, fill your mill jar half full of hardened lead or brass grinding media, and 25% full of potassium nitrate. Turn the mill on and come back in an hour. Your nitrate should be light and fluffy. If not, continue grinding it 'til it's fine powder with no chunks or grains.

I generally use the traditional ratio of 75 parts potassium nitrate, 15 parts charcoal and 10 parts sulfur. If your black powder is intended primarily for use as lift powder, you might want to use the ratio which is purported to be optimized for this purpose. It is 74 parts potassium nitrate, 14 parts charcoal and 12 parts sulfur.

Manufacture of black powder was accomplished originally by hand methods. Ingredients were ground together with a mortar and pestle. The next step was to use crushing devices of wood (wooden stamps), also operated by hand, in wooden or stone bowls. The stamping process was gradually mechanized and, about 1435, the first powder mill driven by water power was erected near Nuremberg, Germany.
