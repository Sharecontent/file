## Coal based power plant - SlideShare
A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water when heated turns into steam which drives a steam turbine. After passing through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. [Rankine cycle] Coal is used as a fuel to heat water in a coal based thermal power plant.

Co-firing with a 20% share of ammonia could reduce the 6 GtCO2/yr annual emissions of these coal plants by 1.2 GtCO2, provided that the ammonia was produced from low-carbon hydrogen. Reaching a 20% blending share would result in an annual ammonia demand of 670 Mt, more than three times today's global ammonia production.
