On site in a King Country limestone quarry, Professor Cam Nelson draws attention to three types of limestone - ÅŒtorohanga A, B and C - each with a different calcium carbonate composition. Knowledge of this composition is of economic interest to the quarry owners. The B layer is a high-grade limestone with over 98% calcium carbonate.

In this paper, we have investigated the study of quarry rock dust as partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. Mix design has been developed for M20 grade using IS design for conventional concrete and replaced mix. Specimens on cubes, cylinders and beams were prepared for both conventional and 20%, 40%, 60% replacement with quarry dust.
