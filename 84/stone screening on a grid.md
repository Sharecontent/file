## âScreen Grid - A Desktop Grid on the Mac App Store
Placing a new grid on the screen adds a tiny grid in the center of the screen. You can resize it by draggin the bottom right corner, but there's no way to drag any of the other corners or the grid itself. So it can only take up the bottom right corner of your screen (give or take a few inches). What a waste of 2 perfectly good dollars.
