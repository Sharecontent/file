## What is Ball Milling Process? - ball mills supplier
The ball milling process is generally divided into two types, the dry ball milling process, and the wet ball milling process. This article takes dry ball milling as an example to introduce the ball milling process. First, select the appropriate size and weight of the grinding medium according to the particle size of the grinding material.

## Basic Ball Mill Grinding Circuit
Grinding coarse ore in a ball-mill is done by steel balls of three sizes (5, 4, and 3 inches); fine ore is ground in a tube-mill by 2- and 1½-inch balls or by flint pebbles or by hard, rounded mine rock such as quartzite. These grinding media wear to small sizes, and new ones must be added regularly to make up the weight.
