## Changes in Acoustic Emissions When Cutting Difference Rock Types
Abstract. Machine cutting of rock is widely used in the coal mining industry. Developing an acoustic emission monitoring system that is capable of detecting changes in rock cutting conditions has the potential to enable the development of a real-time control system which can optimise the operation of rock cutting machines such as longwall shearers and roadheaders.

The quality of marble is affected by mining technology and equipment. In some areas with relatively backward technical level, rock drill is still used as the main mining equipment, combined with expansive agent and air bag as the separation method. This method has low mining efficiency and is not suitable for the needs of today's market.
