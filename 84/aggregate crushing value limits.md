## Limits Of Natural Aggregate Crushing Value
Crushing value 5.88 0.96 as per is permissible limit of crushing value being up to 30. crushing value of natural aggregate is 5.88 and of plastic aggregate is 0.96, which is within permissible limit. this shows that plastic aggregate have more compressive strength than natural aggregate. as per is 2386 part iv1963 aggregate.
