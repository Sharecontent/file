## Lg top load washer making grinding noise during wash cycle
Reinforce the floor. If leveling the LG washer does not stop the noise, especially if the noise is accompanied by excessive vibration, your floor may be too weak for the machine during its high-speed spin cycle . Put the washer on top of a sturdy board to provide a stable foundation. Solid wood planks work well.
