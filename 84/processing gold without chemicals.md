## Common Types of Non-cyanide Gold Recovery Chemicals
The reason why halogens and their compounds can be used as non-cyanide gold recovery chemical is that the oxidation potential when halogens become halogen ions is high enough to dissolve gold. In acidic medium (pH <1), sodium chlorate or chlorine gas is used as oxidant to dissolve gold. The reaction formula is: 3/2Cl2+Au+Cl-→AuCl4-.
