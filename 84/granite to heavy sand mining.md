After mining is complete, the topsoil and overburden may be used in reclamation for slopes and revegetation. Heavy minerals occur as sand grains mixed with lighter clays and quartz sand grains. Within the ore body, less than 5% of the grains may be heavy minerals. Two mining methods are used: suction dredging and auxiliary mining.

## How is Granite Mined? Everything You Need to Know.
Mining granite is a very large industrial process. The first step of making a granite slab is to mine the raw granite materials out of the crust of the earth in large, heavy blocks. Granite slabs are attained from specific sites that are known as quarries. Normally, miners choose quarries that are as close to the surface of the earth as possible.
