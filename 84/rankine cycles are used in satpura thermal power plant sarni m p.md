## Rankine cycle - Energy Education
The Rankine cycle or Rankine Vapor Cycle is the process widely used by power plants such as coal-fired power plants or nuclear reactors. In this mechanism, a fuel is used to produce heat within a boiler, converting water into steam which then expands through a turbine producing useful work. This process was developed in 1859 by Scottish

## Rankine Cycle with Regeneration - Qualitative Reasoning Group
The heat rejection from S2 to S3 occurs at the cooler saturation temperature of 45.8 C. As a quick check, we can find the Rankine cycle's thermal efficiency by applying the relation for Carnot efficiency to the mean Rankine cycle temperatures: h = ( Ta - Tr ) / Ta = (226.7 - 45.8) / (226.7+273.15) = 36.2%.

## What is Rankine Cycle - Steam Turbine Cycle - Thermal Engineering
Today, the Rankine cycle is the fundamental operating cycle of all thermal power plants where an operating fluid is continuously evaporated and condensed. It is the one of most common thermodynamic cycles, because in most of the places in the world the turbine is steam-driven.. In contrast to Carnot cycle, the Rankine cycle does not execute isothermal processes, because these must be performed

## Which cycle do we actually use in a thermal power plant?
Answer (1 of 3): Theoretically thermal power plants works on Rankine cycle, but now a days modified Rankine cycle used for power generation. Modified Rankine cycle means it is the combination of reheat and regeneration of steam for higher PUF and PLF.
