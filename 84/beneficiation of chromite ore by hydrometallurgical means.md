Chromite is of weak magnetism, so intensity magnetic separation has been used in some places but not all chromite can be separated by this intensity magnetic separation. The density of chromite ore is 4.3-4.8g/cm³,and it is a obvious difference with that of waste stone, so gravity separation can work very well for the chromite separation.

## beneficiation techniques chromite ore
The beneficiation studies of Suresh et al 1981 concludes that low grade chromite ore of 16-25 Cr 2 O 3 of Sitampundi area of India cannot be upgraded by using tabling and flotation techniques to meet the metallurgical grade due to the intimate association of iron in the lattice of chromite.

## beneficiation of chromite ore
Jul 14, 2020 · The beneficiation studies of low-grade chromite ore from Ghutrigaon reveals that it can be upgraded through physical beneficiation methods. Following gravity concentration technique, a feed of 16% Cr 2 O 3 can be upgraded to 40.1%, with 23% yield, 58% recovery and Cr/Fe ratio of 3.35
