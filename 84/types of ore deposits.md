## Ore
An ore deposit is an economically significant accumulation of minerals within a host rock. This is distinct from a mineral resource as defined by the mineral resource classification criteria. An ore deposit is one occurrence of a particular ore type. Most ore deposits are named according to their location,

Ore deposits discussed in this article are dominated by a single low-temperature deposit type generally known as sediment-hosted stratiform copper (SSC) mineralization. Two other economically significant deposit types are also covered: (1) redbed-type copper (also known as sandstone copper) and (2) volcanic-associated redbed copper deposits.

PRIMARY EXPRESSIONS OF ORE DEPOSITS A well known aspect of ore deposit expression is the association of particular ore types with particular host rock assemblages, i.e., the ore-host rock association (e.g., Stanton, 1972). This association broadly reﬂects the geological environment and processes that have formed the ore.

An ore deposit may be either of igneous or of sedimentary origin. Some deposits are related to metamorphic processes and are as such classified as deposits of metamorphic origin. Within these three broad modes of origin, a mineral deposit of economic value might have originated due to set of simple or complex processes. Types of Ore Deposits: 1.

What Is An Ore Deposit? An ore deposit consists of one or more ore bodies. An ore body is a mass of rock that contain ore and from which a commodity of value will be extracted. Not all ore within an ore body will be extracted. The ore body and the reserves in many deposits have much more irregular shapes than shown here. .

The temporal distribution of other types of ore deposits is related to their development in geological settings where there is little chance of their long-term survival. This is the case for bauxite, Ni laterite and other deposits that result from weathering, which form at Earth's surface and consist of friable, easily eroded material.

Largest producers are Australia, Jamaica and Guinea.
