## What is the true cost of coal mining in Nigeria? - Ventures Africa
According to Christine K, Director of the Heinrich Böll Foundation Nigeria, "coal is often described as a cheap source of electricity. However, once the cost of health, community resettlement, cleaning up of polluted waters and the reclamation of mining areas are counted, coal is roughly at the same price as solar.".
