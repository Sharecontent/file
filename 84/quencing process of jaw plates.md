## Quenching and Tempering | Specialty Steel Treating
The quenching process can use salt water, forced air, polymer, fresh water or oil. Oil quenching is a common method that we use at Specialty Steel Treating to avoid boiling and produce longer cool times. Other quenching options cool steel too quickly for many applications. Salt water is the fastest option for rapidly cooling your heated steel.
