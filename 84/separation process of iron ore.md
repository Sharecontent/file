## Magnetic separation
Magnetic separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using a magnet to attract magnetic substances. The process that is used for magnetic separation separates non-magnetic substances from those which are magnetic. This technique is useful for the select few minerals which are ferromagnetic (iron-, nickel-, and cobalt-containing minerals) and paramagnetic.

## Methods of Iron Ore Separation Process-FTM Machinery
Methods of Iron Ore Separation Process. At present, there are about 300 kinds of iron ore in nature. According to their chemical composition, iron ore can be divided into magnetite, hematite, limonite and siderite.  When the grinding size is greater than 0.2mm, most iron ore magnetic separation plants usually adopt a grinding - magnetic
