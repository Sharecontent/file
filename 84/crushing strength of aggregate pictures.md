Procedure for crushing strength of aggregate. Before testing, the aggregate should be in surface dry condition.You can achieve the dry condition of aggregate by placing aggregates in an oven for 4 hours at 100-degree Celcius. The aggregates passing through 12.5mm and retained on 10mm IS sieves are selected for finding aggregate crushing strength.

## Influence of crushing index on properties of recycled aggregates 
In general, compressive strength of pervious concrete is related to aggregate strength and total porosity. For this research, strength decrease with increased crushing index is due to the increased brick particles. Firstly, the strength of the brick particles is relatively low, about 10-20 MPa, so it affects the function of concrete strength.

## To Determine Crushing Strength of given Aggregate- Concrete Practical
Fine Aggregate Those particles passing the 9.5 mm (3/8 in.) sieve, almost entirely passing the 4.75 mm (No. 4) sieve, and predominantly retained on the 75 Âµm (No. 200) sieve are called fine aggregate. Practical to determine Crushing Strength of given Aggregate. Watch this Video to know more about Crushing Strength of given Aggregate

## Mechanical Properties of Aggregate - Construction How
Mechanical Properties of Aggregate. Concrete, in general, is a concoction of cement, aggregates and water. Each of these components accounts for a particular purpose or target. However, the liability of imparting strength and durability to concrete rests on aggregates, the coarse ones in particular. This is owing to the fact that aggregates
