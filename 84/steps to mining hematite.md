## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral - Geology
Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron. Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process, hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world. Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.

## Feldspar Mining Process | Equipment | Flow | Cases - JXSC
Hard-rock mining for feldspars is done by open-pit methods, either by the mine owner or by contractors. After the feldspar ore is drilled and blasted, secondary breakage is performed with a conventional drop ball. Ore is then loaded with a hydraulic shovel onto trucks and hauled to the crushing plant, which is adjacent to the flotation plant.
