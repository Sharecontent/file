## What Is Mineral Processing in Mining?
Mineral processing is a form of extractive metallurgy that separates valuable minerals from the ore into a concentrated, marketable product. Mineral processing is also known as mineral dressing. Mineral processing is conducted at the site of the mine and is a highly mechanical process, with oversight from a central control room.

## What are the 3 environmental impacts of mineral extraction?
What are three harmful environmental effects of mining and processing minerals? The effects can result in erosion, sinkholes, loss of biodiversity, or the contamination of soil, groundwater, and surface water by the chemicals emitted from mining processes. These processes also affect the atmosphere from the emissions of carbon which have an effect on the quality of human health and biodiversity.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
