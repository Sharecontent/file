## Ballasting and deballasting of ship - Marinerspoint Pro
Ballasting is the process of filling tanks with ballast water using large capacity ballast pumps. When the ship is loaded with cargo, the weight of the cargo itself maintains the ship's stability, and thus no ballast water is required. De-ballasting is the process of removing ballast water from ballast tanks in order to empty them.
