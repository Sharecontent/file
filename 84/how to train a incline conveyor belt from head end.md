## Smalis Conveyors | Conveyor Belt Tracking / Training - Radial Stackers
Shifting the idler axis with respect to the path of the belt, commonly known as "knocking idlers," is effective where the entire belt runs to one side along some portion of the conveyor or radial stacker. The belt can be centered by "knocking" ahead (in the direction of belt travel) the end of the idler to which the belt runs.

Once the belt is clear of all danger points, a sequence of training operations can be followed. The best procedure to use in starting the training sequence is probably to start with the return run and work toward the tail pulley. This assures early centering of the belt on the tail pulley so that it can be centrally loaded.
