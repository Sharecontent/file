## Investigations on replacement of sand by graded quarry dust in concrete 
investigated the partial replacement of sand with quarry dust. Initially cement concrete cube was studied with various proportions of cement concrete + quarry dust (M 20, AND M25). The experimental results showed that the addition of quarry dust as fine aggregate ratio of 30%, 40% and 50% was found to enhance the compressive properties
