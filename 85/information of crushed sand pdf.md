## Study on the Gradation of Crushed Sand by Using a Novel Digital Image 
Nov 19, 2020It is a trend to replace the increasing shortage of natural sand with crushed sand for the development of building materials. To meet the construction requirements, it is necessary to measure the shape and gradation of crushed sand that is difficult to control. To solve this problem, a novel digital image processing methodology is proposed in this paper. Through the setting of camera

The goal of this study was to determine the angularity and roundness of particles for use in fine aggregate for Portland Concrete.
