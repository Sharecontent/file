Surface grinding machines usually have fixed work speeds of approximately 50 sfpm or have variable work speed ranges between 0 and 80 sfpm. As with cylindrical grinding, the higher work speeds mean that more material is being cut per surface foot of wheel rotation and therefore more wear is liable to occur on the wheel.
