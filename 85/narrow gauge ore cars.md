John23 Member. The early (70's) Atlas ore cars, the K-Line, and the RMT share the same body casting, which IMO is the most accurate plastic model of a Lake Superior style ore car available. The main difference between these are the trucks/couplers. The Atlas has all plastic trucks and dummy couplers.
