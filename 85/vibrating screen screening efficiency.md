## Screening efficiency and screen length of a linear vibrating screen 
The length of the screen surface was 160 mm and it was evenly divided into eight parts so the relationship between screen length and screening efficiency could be analyzed. 3.2. Screening efficiency versus screen length: varied frequency and vibration angle. Frequency mainly influences the bounce state of particles on the screen surface.

## Intelligent Prediction of Sieving Efficiency in Vibrating Screens - Hindawi
Relation between sieving efficiency and other working parameters in a vibrating screen such as mesh aperture size, screen length, inclination angle, vibration amplitude, and vibration frequency was analyzed. Based on the experiments, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) was established to predict the sieving efficiency, and adaptive
