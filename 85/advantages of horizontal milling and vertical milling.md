## CNC Milling - Vertical & Horizontal - New Age Metal Fabricating Company
Horizontal and vertical milling are simply two different variations of milling. The main difference between them is the alignment of the cutting elements, also called spindles, on the mill. As you might expect, the spindles on vertical mills are aligned vertically. The spindles on horizontal mills are aligned horizontally or parallel to the ground.

## A Brief Overview of Horizontal vs. Vertical Milling Machines - Summit 
Horizontal milling machines are somewhat less common than vertical milling machines. They are typically larger machine tools often found in heavy industrial settings. On a horizontal milling machine, a workpiece is mounted to a flat bed, which can travel along the X and Y axes. The cutting tool is usually a blade or disk, spinning like a saw

## The Difference between a Horizontal and Vertical Milling Machine 
At first glance, horizontal and vertical milling machines look very similar, or at least they can look quite similar. The only real difference comes in the cutting heads. Instead of a fixed spindle rotating vertically, horizontal mills (like our Summit® #3 Series Universal Horizontal Milling Machine) have a single horizontal arbor.
