#1 - The cost of quartz varies depending on the quality of the stone and the brand that you buy, but you can expect to pay anywhere from $30 per sq. ft. for low quality options up to $150 per sq. ft. or possibly even more if you go super high end. Quartz is usually, but not always, a little less expensive than granite, depending on the quality.

The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years, owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries. However, the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low-grade iron ore has been processed. The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.

Results are presented showing that it is possible to produce metallic iron directly from low-grade ores. The metal is in a form that can be easily separated to produce a high-grade iron product, and the iron recovery is greater than can be achieved from difficult-to-process ores by conventional means.

## Understanding Iron Ores and Mining of Iron Ore - IspatGuru
Mining (extraction), beneficiation, and processing of iron ore produces iron and steel. Mining is defined as removing ore material from a deposit and encompasses all activities prior to beneficiation. High grade iron ores (iron content greater than 62 %) are simply crushed, screened and shipped directly to the iron making unit (e.g. blast furnace).

## Development of Impurities Removal Process for Low-Grade Iron ores using 
19. Conclusion In order to remove silica and alumina from Low-grade ore such as Sanje Ore with Fe 34.18 mass% and high impurities (SiO2/Al2O3- 38.75mass%), Two stage Process (Magnetic separation followed by reverse flotation) was established as the best impurities removal process for low-grade iron ore because of. Higher iron recovery > 80%
