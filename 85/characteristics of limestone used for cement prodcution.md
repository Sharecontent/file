## Cement & Concrete Basics FAQs
What is portland-limestone cement? Portland-limestone cement (PLC) is a type of blended cement specified under ASTM C595 (or AASHTO M 240). In the US and Canada, PLCs are made with portland cement and between 5% and 15% fine limestone.

## Physico-chemical properties of nano metakaolin on the characteristics 
The materials used in this work were blended OPC limestone (24%), nano metakaolin. This thesis aims to study the effect of some nano materials such as nano metakaolin (NMK) on the hydration characteristics of blended cement pastes up to 90 days of hydration. Blended cements containing 0, 5 and 10 wt% nano MK, were also studied. The hydration and the physico-mechanical characteristics of cement
