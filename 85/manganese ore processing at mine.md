Manganese is not found as a free element in nature. It is often found in combination with iron. The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite. Manganese is primarily used in iron and steel industry. It is the basic raw material for manufacturing steel alloys. 6 kilograms of manganese ore is required for manufacturing one tonne of steel.

manganese processing, preparation of the ore for use in various products. Manganese (Mn) is a hard, silvery white metal with a melting point of 1,244 °C (2,271 °F). Ordinarily too brittle to be of structural value itself, it is an essential agent in steelmaking, in which it removes impurities such as sulfur and oxygen and adds important physical properties to the metal.
