## DETERMINATION OF UNIT WEIGHT OF COARSE AGGREGATES.docx
The bulk density of most natural mineral aggregates, such as sand and gravel, ranges from 1520 to 1680 kg/cm and produces normal-weight concrete with a unit weight of around 2400 kg/m3 (Mahmud, 2021). Natural mineral aggregates are concrete aggregates made out of sand, gravel, and crushed rock from natural sources (Alexander & Mindess, 2010
