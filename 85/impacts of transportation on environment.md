The most direct impact of transportation on health is vehicle-related injuries and deaths. Motor vehicle accidents are not limited to cars and their occupants but include accidents involving trucks, vans, busses, pedestrians, and bicyclers. Transportation systems can impact health and well-being in other surprising ways.

## Environmental effects of transport
The environmental effects of transport are significant because transport is a major user of energy, and burns most of the world's petroleum.This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide. Within the transport sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.
