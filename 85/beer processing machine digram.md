Add your crushed grains. Turn on the heat to medium high and bring the temperature up to 150 to 155 degrees. Turn off the heat and cover the brew pot to let the magic take place inside for 30 minutes. Use a strainer to remove as much of the spent grain as possible without worrying too much about a few remaining grains.

## All Grain Brewing Process: A Beginner's Guide
The Basic Process. In all-grain brewing, crushed malted grains are soaked in hot water, typically in a range of °F, for 1 hour to extract the grain's sugars. This process is known as mashing. The fermentable sugary liquid, called wort, is drained (lautered) to the boil kettle, leaving the spent grains behind.

#3 Capping. Beer bottling also involves the capping process whereby the already filled bottles are run through a capping machine that seals them with the cap.This capping process is also dependent on the type of the beer filling machine. If the filling machine has a high speed with a large capacity of bottles, then the capping machine will also have the same feature.
