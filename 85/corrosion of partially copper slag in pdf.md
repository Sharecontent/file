## Copper Slag - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
The chemical composition of copper slag varies with the type of furnace. The typical composition of smelting slags is Fe (as FeO, Fe 3 O 4) 30-40%; SiO 2 35-40%; Al 2 O 3 up to 10%; and CaO up to 10%. The density of copper slag varies between 3.16 and 3.87 g/cm 3 based on the amount of iron content. The average specific gravity of copper

Copper Slag Partially Replaces Fine Aggregate in M 25  with M-sand, natural sand and copper slag concrete. Natural fine aggregate is completely replaced by M-sand and partially by copper slag. Compressive strength is evaluated and compared up to 28 days of ages. Specific properties of concrete materials and copper slag are also studied.

Granulated copper slag is more porous and therefore, has lower specific gravity and higher absorption capacity than air-cooled copper slag. The granulated copper slag is made up of regularly shaped, angular particles, mostly between 4.75 and 0.075 mm (No. 200 sieve) in size (Emery, 1986, Hughes and Haliburton, 1973).

## Disadvantages of ductile iron pipe-bau-immobilien
Ductile iron has a greater resistance to impacts, and is able to resist a minimum of 7 foot pounds of impact (versus 2 pounds of impact for gray iron ). This means that while ductile iron can be used in critical applications that involve impact, gray iron has limits that prohibit it from being used for certain purposes.
