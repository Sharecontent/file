## Influence of coal properties on coal conversion processes-coal 
The chemical constituents present in coal structure impact greatly on its mechanical behavior. The composition of organic matter and its degree of decomposition led to varying coal strength and modulus of elasticity of different coals (Pan et al. 2013; Singh and Mrityunjay 2018b; Ahamed et al. 2019) as the chemical structure was altered.Coals of low rank have a high concentration of aliphatic

## Coal-fired power station
A coal-fired power station or coal power plant is a thermal power station which burns coal to generate electricity.Worldwide there are about 8,500 coal-fired power stations totaling over 2,000 gigawatts capacity. They generate about a third of the world's electricity, but cause many illnesses and early deaths, mainly from air pollution.. A coal-fired power station is a type of fossil fuel
