Cement Manufacturing Process Phase 1: Raw Material Extraction. Cement uses raw materials that cover calcium, silicon, iron and aluminum. Such raw materials are limestone, clay and sand. Limestone is for calcium. It is combined with much smaller proportions of sand and clay. Sand & clay fulfill the need of silicon, iron and aluminum.

## Optimization of Cement Grinding Operation in Ball Mills - PEC 
Operation and Elements of a Closed Circuit Ball Mill System. Cement ball mills typically have two grinding chambers. The first chamber is filled with larger diameter grinding media and lined with lifting liners. The first chamber coarse-grinds the feed material and prepares it for the second chamber. The second chamber is the fine grinding chamber.

## Manufacturing of Portland Cement - Process and Materials
The manufacture of Portland cement is a complex process and done in the following steps: grinding the raw materials, mixing them in certain proportions depending upon their purity and composition, and burning them to sintering in a kiln at a temperature of about 1350 to 1500 ⁰C. During this process, these materials partially fuse to form nodular shaped clinker by broking of chemical bonds of

Solution. Verified by Toppr. Cement is manufactured in two steps: Formation of clinker. Formation of cement from clinker. Raw materials are first crushed and homogenised into the mixture into a rotary kiln. There it is heated with 2000 ∘ flame. The kiln is kept at an inclined position so that the material reaches the other end and cools down.

Fig. 6-2 shows the flow diagram of mixing of raw materials by the wet process.
