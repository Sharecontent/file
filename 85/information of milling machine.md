## 5 Fast Facts About Milling Machines | OneMonroe
All milling machines product swarf during operation. Going back to the basics of milling, this process is designed to remove material from workpieces. As the cutting tool presses against the workpiece, it cuts or digs out material. The material removed from milling is known as swarf or chips. Most manufacturing companies recycle or reuse swarf.
