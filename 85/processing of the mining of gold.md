These illegal gold miners use mercury to extract gold, leaching the toxic chemical into the air and water. About 1,000 tons of mercury is released into the environment every year by the 15 million artisanal gold miners around the world. Mercury is harmful to human health, damaging the kidney, liver, lungs, colon, heart and the immune system.

## Developing public health strategies for artisanal and small-scale 
Overview Mercury amalgamation remains the preferred method to extract gold employed in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) worldwide. Liquid elemental mercury is added to an ore slurry to bind to gold and form a gold-mercury complex (amalgam). When gold is separated from mercury in the smelting process, high concentrations of mercury vapours are released.

Mining is the process of extracting useful materials from the earth. Some examples of substances that are mined include coal, gold, or iron ore.Iron . ore is the material from which the metal iron is produced.. The process of mining dates back to prehistoric times.. Prehistoric people first mined flint, which was ideal for tools and weapons since it breaks into shards with sharp edges.
