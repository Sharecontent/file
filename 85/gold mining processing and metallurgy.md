Panning. Gold panning is mainly a manual gold separation technique from other materials. Large, shallow pans are filled with gold-containing sand and gravel. The pan is submerged and shaken in water, sorting the gravel gold and other material. It quickly settles down to the bottom of the pan as gold is much denser than rock.

## The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching - An Introduction
A paper published by L. Elsner in 1846 first correctly identified the chemical reaction that forms the basis of all gold cyanide leaching processes: 4 Au + 8 NaCN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O → 4 Na [Au (CN) 2] + 4 NaOH. The equation is well known, but the successful application of this reaction in a gold mining operation is rarely straightforward.

## Thiosulphate as an alternative to cyanide for gold processing - issues 
Thiosulphate is an attractive alternative reagent to cyanide for processing gold ores. It is relatively cheap and non-toxic, forms relatively strong gold and silver complexes, and readily leaches gold ores in ammoniacal solutions, catalysed by Cu(II). It is particularly suited to carbonaceous ores where the recovery of gold by cyanide is poor.

## Metallurgical testwork: Gold processing options, physical ore 
The recovery of gold from heaps or dumps is often seen as a specialty area of gold metallurgy, or at the least, gold processing (Van Zyl et al., 1988). A requirement to be able to scale up from laboratory tests to field application has seen the need to develop specific procedures and techniques, in order to facilitate this and minimize risk.
