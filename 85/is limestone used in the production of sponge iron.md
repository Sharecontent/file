## sponge iron limestone
Sponge iron is a valuable source of iron for the production of high-quality steel. With the Direct Reduction technology that has been developed considerably in recent years, sponge iron melting in electric arc furnaces has more qualitative advantages than scrap metal smelting for steel making. Some of the benefits include:

## Sorption-enhanced reforming with limestone from iron production
In this work, the experimental performance of sorption-enhanced reforming using limestone as bed material, which is used in raw iron production, is presented. Steam gasification of solid biomass by sorption-enhanced reforming process (SER) leads to product gas with high hydrogen content and low tar content. The product gas can be used for a wide range of applications. This includes heat and
