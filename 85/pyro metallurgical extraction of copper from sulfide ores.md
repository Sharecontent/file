## Extractive Metallurgy of Copper - Meaning, Method and Example - VEDANTU
Smelting of Copper. Smelting is really a metallurgical technique for extracting base metals from their ores with both the support of heat as well as a chemical reducing agent. Copper Smelting indicates that only the concentrated ore is intensely warmed up by silicon dioxide (silica), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and air within the kiln.

It may have different pH values, oxidation-reduction potentials, chelating agent composition, temperature and other properties depending on the type of metal we are going to

This is the basis of pyrometallurgy. Pyrometallurgy deals with the methods of extraction of metals from their ores and their refining and is based on physical and chemical changes occurring at high temperatures, i.e. °C. Pyrometallurgical methods of metal production are usually cheaper and suited for large scale productions.

## Solvometallurgical process for extraction of copper from chalcopyrite 
In summary, pyro-metallurgy, hydrometallurgy and bioleaching all have their limitations, and hence it is important to develop new green and sustainable metallurgy technologies to improve the eﬃciency of copper extraction from copper sulfide ores. Solvometallurgy is an emerging technology for metal proces-sing, where little or no water is

## A Review on Novel Techniques for Chalcopyrite Ore Processing
1.2. Chalcopyrite Ore Production The sulfide ore minerals including chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2), sphalerite (ZnS), galena (PbS) provide the major sources of the world's base metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, respectively), whereas pyrite is virtually ubiquitous as a metalliferous mineral in sulfide ore deposits (Crang and Vanghan, 1994).The first step in recovering metal from their mineral is that of finding
