The artificial slag aggregates (ASA) replaced partially the natural coarse aggregates in production of self-compacting concrete (SCC). Moreover, as being one of the most widely used mineral admixtures in concrete industry, fly ash (FA) was incorporated as a part of total binder content to impart desired fluidity to SCCs.

Coarse Aggregates in concrete provides body and strength to the concrete and acts as a filler material which will give the homogeneous mass of the concrete.. Coarse aggregates are used in every Construction projects which includes the construction of roads, Buildings, Railway Tracks etc.. Coarse Aggregate in concrete was considered as chemically inactive and acts as a filler material only.

The coarse aggregate mixed with bitumen is used in wearing coats of roads. In railways, the high-strength crushed coarse aggregate is used as ballast to safely transfer the loads and vibration to the subgrade. A graded mixture of fine and coarse aggregate is used as filtration media in water and sewage treatment.

## Coarse Aggregates in Construction | Types and Uses
Aggregates that cannot pass through the IS Sieve of 4.75mm are called coarse aggregates. They are crushed stones or naturally occurring gravel used in making concrete. Their maximum size can go up to 63mm. Coarse aggregates are usually formed by blasting the stone quarries. Though sometimes, they are also hand-crushed.

Coarse aggregates are any particles greater than 0.19 inch, but generally range between 3/8 and 1.5 inches in diameter. Gravels constitute the majority of coarse aggregate used in concrete with crushed stone making up most of the remainder.
