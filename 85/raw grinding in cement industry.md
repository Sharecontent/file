## Manufacturing process
The raw mix is fed into a circular storage unit called a raw mix storage. Then, the mix is extracted transversely from the stockpile by reclaimers and conveyed to a raw mill bin called the raw mix bin for grinding. The other raw materials that are used in cement manufacturing, called additives, are high purity limestone, sand and iron ore.
