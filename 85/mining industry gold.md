## The Mining Industry: What It Is and How It's Changing Worldwide
The mining industry contributes 2-3% of the global carbon dioxide emissions. As such, the future of the mining industry requires a significant commitment towards a reduction in emissions. To achieve a 1.5º Celsius climate change target by 2050, the mining industry will need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to zero.
