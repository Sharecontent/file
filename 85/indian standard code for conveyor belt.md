Pipe Conveyor Design. In pipe conveyors, the belt is rolled into a tube. These conveyors can negotiate tight curves and keep the material isolated from the environment. Our engineers invented a special carcass construction that is used by leading belt manufacturers to ensure the pipe is stable in horizontal curves (US Patent USB2).
