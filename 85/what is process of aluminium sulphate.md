## Aluminium Sulphate in Water Purification - Cudgel
Aluminum sulphate is widely used as a flocculent in water treatment plants in developing countries. It is also widely available in developing countries, sold in blocks of soft white stone, and generally called alum. There are numerous ways to use alum as a flocculent, including to crush it into a powder before adding it to water, stirring and

## Aluminum Coagulant - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Aluminium sulphate is the most widely used aluminium coagulant (Section 8.20). It is available in a number of solid grades such as block, kibbled or ground and is also available as a solution typically containing 8-8.3% w/w Al 2 O 3. In waterworks practice aluminium sulphate is frequently but incorrectly referred to as 'alum'.

Aluminium sulphate, normally recognized as alum is a solid crystalline powder that is dissolvable in water. It includes over 17% alumina (Al2O3) and is produced from sulphuric acid and aluminium trihydrate. Aluminium sulphate is also obtained as an 18-hydrate Al2 (SO4)3.18H2O. Both forms are soluble in water, non-combustible, and nontoxic.
