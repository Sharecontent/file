## Foundry Sand - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
4.1 Introduction. Used foundry sand (UFS) (Fig. 4.1) is a discarded material coming from ferrous (iron and steel) and nonferrous (copper, aluminium, and brass) metal-casting industry to create molds and cores. About 1 ton of foundry sand for each ton of iron or steel casting produced is used ( Siddique and Noumowec, 2008 ).

## What is foundry sand? - Solex - Solex Thermal Sciences
What is foundry sand? Foundry sand is clean, uniformly sized, high quality silica sand, used in foundry casting processes. The sand is bonded to form molds or patterns used for ferrous (iron and steel) and non-ferrous (copper, aluminum, brass) metal castings. Shake-out sand from completed metal casting are often reclaimed back into the foundry

Green Sand. Green sand refers to the sand molds formed from wet sand and is sometimes referred to as clay. The sand mold is in an uncured state as the metal is being poured. Sand casting using green sand is quick and inexpensive since the sand can be reused. The downside is that the sand is a soft mold and can collapse or shift during casting
