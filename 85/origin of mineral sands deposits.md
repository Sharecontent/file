Origins. Sandstones are clastic in origin (as opposed to either organic like chalk and coal or chemical like gypsum and jasper). The silicate sand grains from which they form are the product of physical and chemical weathering of bedrock. . This mostly consists of compaction and lithification of the sand. Where are sandstones formed?

An ore deposit may be either of igneous or of sedimentary origin. Some deposits are related to metamorphic processes and are as such classified as deposits of metamorphic origin. Within these three broad modes of origin, a mineral deposit of economic value might have originated due to set of simple or complex processes. Types of Ore Deposits: 1.

The provenance of a placer deposit is directly tied to its mineralogy; for example, heavy mineral sands derived from high-grade metamorphic rocks tend to be richer in rutile and monazite, while those from low- to medium-grade metamorphic rocks typically have lower rutile and monazite but higher titanite and staurolite (Force 1991).

## MINERAL SANDS - Earth Sci
Mineral sand deposits are formed from the erosion and weathering of pre-existing igneous rocks such as granite, pegmatite and basalt. Over 60 to 200 million years the combinations of wind and water from ancient rivers and seas have leached the minerals from their past rocks and concentrated them into beach and dune deposits.

The end products are often kiln-dried and bagged (for transport). Mineral sands are also found on land in sedimentary deposits that accumulated at times when sea level was much higher than it is today.

Heavy mineral sands are a class of ore deposit which is an important source of zirconium, titanium, thorium, tungsten, rare-earth elements, the industrial minerals diamond, sapphire, garnet, and occasionally precious metals or gemstones.. Heavy mineral sands are placer deposits formed most usually in beach environments by concentration due to the specific gravity of the mineral grains.
