Specific Gravity Formula. Specific Gravity gives information about the weight and density of the object. It can be calculated by comparing the weight, mass and density of the given object with water of the same amount at 4 0 C. Specific gravity is a unitless measurement. The density of water is 1000 Kg/m 3.

## Specific Gravity Of Cement - Test Procedure & Simple Explanation
Specific Gravity of Cement is nothing but the ratio between the volume of cement to the volume of the same quantity of water. Usually, the value lies between 3.10 - 3.16 g/cc. Some types of cement such as PPC, Portland Blast furnace slag will have the value near 2.90. In simple, Cement is 3.10 times heavier than the water.
