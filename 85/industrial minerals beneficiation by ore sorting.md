## The beneficiation of lithium minerals from hard rock ores: A review
The various techniques used in the beneficiation of lithium minerals from hard rock pegmatite ores containing spodumene, petalite, lepidolite and amblygonite have been reviewed. Dense media separation and flotation are the main beneficiation methods used in many plants around the world. The success in separating lithium minerals from ores using

## Ore Sorting & Pre-Concentration - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Ore Sorting helps the economics of mining when ore becomes diluted by country rock because of narrow slopes or because of weak wall rock, or when it naturally contains barren material which is distinguishable from the ore, sorting and rejecting the worthless rock may be economical. This is done in a casual manner at some small mines and on a large scale at others, as was the case at Alaska
