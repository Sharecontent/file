Determining the correct size of pulleys should include consideration of ease of access for service. A larger diameter pulley one with a minimum pulley diameter of 600 millimeters (24 inches) would allow adequate space between the carrying and return runs for installation of a tail pulley protection plow and, if necessary, a return belt plow.
