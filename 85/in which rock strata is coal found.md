Smith needed a way to tell layers apart, no matter where in England they were located. As he accumulated observations of strata and fossils in mines and canals, he found the key to telling the layers apart: their fossils were different. While working as surveyor for the Somerset Coal Canal, Smith was able to track rock layers across the landscape.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

## Where's Coal Found? - Geology | ScienceBriefss
Coal occurs as layers, known as coal beds or coal seams, which are found between other sedimentary rocks. Coal is slightly denser than water but less dense than the majority of the rocks from the Earths crust. The density varies for the way porous (filled with holes) the coal is. Sometimes the pores have a gas known as methane.

May 30, 2022Movements of strata over coal seams can be caused by underground activities, e.g. tunneling, mining, etc. Vertical displacement in each stratum can develop in an upward manner from the stratum adjacent to the coal seam to the surface.  The thickness and mechanical properties of each underground rock stratum vary widely.

## Coal | Properties, Formation, Occurrence and Uses - Geology Science
Coal is a non-clastic sedimentary rock. They are the fossilized remains of plants and are in flammable black and brownish-black tones. Its main element is carbon, but it can also contain different elements such as hydrogen, sulfur and oxygen. Unlike coal minerals, it does not have a fixed chemical composition and crystal structure.

## Where is strata found? - ameasy
Is strata found underground? Movements of strata over coal seams can be caused by underground activities, e.g. tunneling, mining, etc. Vertical displacement in each stratum can develop in an upward manner from the stratum adjacent to the coal seam to the surface. The thickness and mechanical properties of each underground rock stratum vary widely.
