## Applications of Gene Expression Programming and Regression  - MDPI
Compressive strength is one of the important property of concrete and depends on many factors. Most of the concrete compressive strength predictive models mainly rely on available literature data, which are too simple to consider all the contributing factors. This study adopted a new approach to predict the compressive strength of sugarcane bagasse ash concrete (SCBAC).

Compressive Strength of concrete = Maximum compressive load carried by specimen / Cross Sectional Area surface of specimen. Take it as, Cross sectional Area = 150mm X 1500mm = 22500 mm 2 or 225 cm 2. Assume the compression load is 400 KN, Compressive Strength = (400000 /22500) = 17.77 /9.81 = 181.22 kg/cm2. Note - 1 kg is equal to 9.81 N

## Comparison of Compressive and Tensile Strengths of Dry-Cast Concrete 
An experimental work was carried out to examine the properties of dry-cast concrete using both types of cements (PPC and OPC). The development of its compressive strength was also monitored at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days of age. The splitting test was conducted to describe the tensile strength of dry-cast concrete.

## Types of concrete grade and their ratio as per British Standard (BS)
C25 concrete grade mix ratio. In United kingdom, for nominal mix, ratio of C25 concrete grade is 1:1:2, in which one part is Portland cement mixed with 1 part of fine aggregate/ sand and 2 part of coarse aggregate with required quantity of water to reach compressive strength 25 Newton per square millimetre (N/mm2) or 25MPa at 28 days curing of a concrete cube size 15cm×15cm×15cm.

## Concrete compressive strength prediction modeling utilizing deep 
Feb 15, 2021One of the most critical parameters in concrete design is compressive strength. As the compressive strength of concrete is correctly measured, time and cost can be decreased. Concrete strength is relatively resilient to impacts on the environment. The production of concrete compressive strength is greatly influenced by severe weather conditions and increases in humidity rates. In this research
