## 5 Fast Facts about CNC Milling - CNC Masters
Depending on the exact configuration of the mill, either the workpiece or the cutter will move slowly to feed the workpiece through the machine. Lathes switch things around. The workpiece rotates rapidly, while the cutter slowly passes along the part to remove material. 2. Not all CNC is milling (or machining!)
