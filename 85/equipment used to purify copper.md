## Copper(I)_iodide
Copper(I) iodide is the chemical compound with the formula CuI; it is also known as cuprous iodide.It is useful in a variety of applications ranging from organic synthesis to cloud seeding.. Copper(I) iodide is white, but samples are often tan or even, when found in nature as mineral marshite, reddish brown, but such color is due to impurities. It is common for iodides to become discolored

## Distillation
Distillation, or classical distillation, is the process of separating the components or substances from a liquid mixture by using selective boiling and condensation. Dry distillation is the heating of solid materials to produce gaseous products (which may condense into liquids or solids).

The maximum conductivity of ETP copper occurs at approximately 200 ppm of oxygen as shown in Figure 3. Consequently, oxygen content for ETP copper is generally in the range of 175 to 450 ppm. Lower oxygen values are usually avoided because of a propensity to hot cracking resulting from uncombined impurities.
