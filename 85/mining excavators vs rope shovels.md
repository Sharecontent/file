## Dragline excavator
A dragline excavator is a piece of heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining . Draglines fall into two broad categories: those that are based on standard, lifting cranes, and the heavy units which have to be built on-site. Most crawler cranes, with an added winch drum on the front, can act as a dragline.

Shovels have the ability to load large quantities of material, but less than draglines. A major difference between a shovel and dragline is that a shovel loads material at the same level as the shovel is sitting up to the height of the shovel's boom. Here are some additional characteristics of shovels. The shovel's dipper is filled by
