## Description Of Cement Plant Grinding Process - Gordon van Veelen
Aug 20, 2015 Cement manufacturing is a complex process that begins with mining and then grinding raw materials that include limestone and clay, to a fine powder, called raw meal, which is then heated to a sintering temperature as high as 1450 C in a cement kiln. In this process, the chemical bonds of the raw materials are broken down and then

## Cement Manufacturing Process: How the Cement is Made?
3. Grinding: The clinkers as obtained from the rotary kiln are finely ground in ball mills and tube mills. During grinding, a small quantity, about 3 to 4 per cent, of gypsum is added. The gypsum controls the initial setting time of cement. If gypsum is not added, the cement would set as soon as water is added.

## Cement clinker
Cement clinker is a solid material produced in the manufacture of Portland cement as an intermediary product. Clinker occurs as lumps or nodules, usually 3 millimetres (0.12 in) to 25 millimetres (0.98 in) in diameter. It is produced by sintering (fusing together without melting to the point of liquefaction) limestone and aluminosilicate materials such as clay during the cement kiln stage.

## Heat treatment process for high chromium grinding ball
Especially as the third generation of anti-wear Alloy High Chromium White cast iron developed successfully, so that more than 4.5 m of large-scale cement mill ball consumption to 30 ~ 50 G / T, medium and small-scale cement mill ball consumption also reduced to only 100 G / T or so The new material revolution has greatly improved productivity
