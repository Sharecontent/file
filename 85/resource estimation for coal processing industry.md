## Coal resource estimation using Gaussian copula - ScienceDirect
Gaussian copulas are first used in water resource estimation ( Bardossy, 2006) and later in other areas ( Bardossy and Li, 2008, Kazianka and Pilz, 2010a, Kazianka and Pilz, 2010b ). In this study, an estimation method based on Gaussian copula is introduced and applied to resource estimation of Saray (Tekirdağ, Turkey) coal field.

## Coal Resource - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Coal resource and coal reserve classification is currently based upon three criteria: 1) thickness of the coal bed, 2) depth of the coal bed, and 3) the reliability of the data upon which the estimate was based. The criteria for each category are described below and summarized in Table A1 and will be used in preparing all Department of Interior coal resource/reserve estimates from January 1

These estimates rely on the most recent MSHA data, which is usually a two-quarter lag, with only a one-quarter lag the last few weeks of a quarter. Because of this lag, significant industry changes may not be accurately reflected in the estimation process. Estimates are revised with actual data once it is available from MSHA.

## Resource estimation
New in this release, you can estimate and predict the resource utilization of parallel job runs by creating models and making projections in the Resource Estimation window.. A model estimates the system resources for a job, including the amount of scratch space, disk space, and CPU time that is needed for each stage to run on each partition.

## Mineral resource estimation
A typical resource estimation involves the construction of a geological and resource model with data from various sources. Depending on the nature of the information and whether the data is hard copy or computerized, the principal steps of computer resource estimation are: Creation, standardization and validation of the database.

Background [1] Estimating the physical characteristics (tonnage, grade, size, shape and location) of a mineral deposit is an extremely important process of the exploration phase within the overall mining operation. This process involves a team of a geologist and geostatistician in order to determine information for the mineral Resource Block Model.

## How to estimate the resources of a project - Twproject: project 
The bottom-up estimate: this means splitting complex tasks into simpler tasks and processing the resources needed for each small step. The need or cost of the resources of the individual tasks is then added together to obtain a total estimate. The smaller and more detailed the task, the greater the accuracy of this technique.
