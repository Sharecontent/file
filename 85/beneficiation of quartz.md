## Quartz Mineral | Photos, Uses, Properties, Pictures - Geology
Quartz is a mineral composed of silicon and oxygen, with a chemical composition of SiO 2. It is the most abundant mineral in Earth's crust and is resistant to both chemical and physical weathering. When rocks weather away, the residual material usually contains quartz. This is why the sand at most of the world's beaches is quartz.

Quartz sand beneficiation process can be applied to quartz sand containing iron or mica. Washing, grading and desliming. The grade of SiO2 in quartz sand decreases with the finer grain size of quartz sand, and the grade of impurity minerals is opposite. This phenomenon is especially obvious in quartz sand containing a large amount of clay minerals.
