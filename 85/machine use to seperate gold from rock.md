## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.
