A blast furnace is a block that smelts ores, raw metals, iron and gold armor and tools, similar to a furnace. A blast furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 100 game ticks (5 seconds) or twelve items per minute, which is twice as fast as a standard furnace. It also serves as an armorer's job site block. A blast furnace can be picked up by any pickaxe. If mined without a pickaxe, it

This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

##  HOW A BLAST FURNACE WORKSrygate
Iron oxides can come to the blast furnace plant in the form of raw ore, pellets or sinter. The raw ore is removed from the earth and sized into pieces that range from 0.5 to 1.5 inches. This ore is either Hematite (Fe 2O 3) or Magnetite (Fe 3O 4) and the iron content ranges from 50% to 70%. This iron rich ore can be charged directly into

## Pig Iron Manufacturing Process - Metallurgist & Mineral Processing Engineer
Pig Iron. At the beginning of the use of the electric furnace, for the manufacture of calcium carbide and ferro-alloys, experimental work was conducted in it upon the production of steel from iron ore. For many years steel and wrought iron have been produced directly from ore on a small scale in the forge, crucible, and reverberatory furnaces

## Draw the diagram of the blast furnace used in the extraction of iron 
Complete step by step answer: First, let us know about the use of blast furnaces. As mentioned it is used to attain the iron by reduction with the carbon, and carbon is attained in the form of coke. The ores extracted in the blast furnace are hematite, magnetite. Now, we will draw the diagram of a blast furnace used in the extraction of iron.
