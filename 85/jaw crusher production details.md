The ore is to be broken down in a jaw crusher to pass through a 11.5 cm screen. The undersize is scalped before feeding to the jaw crusher. Assuming the maximum feed rate is maintained at 30 t/h and the shapes of feed and product are the same and the crusher set is 10 cm, estimate the size of jaw crusher required and the production rate.

## Jaw Crushers - Parker Plant
Rocksizer Jaw Crushers. RockSizer primary stage jaw crushers feature the upthrust toggle action which is also common to the StoneSizer range. Developed by Parker, this gives a slight downward movement to the swing jaw that promotes a forced feed and therefore increased output while at the same time minimising any rubbing action resulting in a well shaped product and reduced and even wear on

## Jaw Crusher Explained - saVRee
For example, a 32 x 54 sized jaw crusher will measure 32 inches from the movable to stationary jaw (when measured at the top i.e. the opening), and each jaw will have a 54-inch width. If a jaw crusher is rated by jaw plate size, a suitable rating maybe 600 x 400, which indicates a 600 mm by 400 mm jaw plate dimension.

A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio. A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio. Thus, with a 3⁄4" closed side setting, the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. Reduction ratios of 8:1 may be possible in certain coarse crushing applications.
