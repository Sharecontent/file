## Slag aggregates | Tarmac
Steel slag and old bank slags may undergo volumetric expansion in the presence of water. The risk of damaging expansion occurring when using steel slag produced in modern processes is minimised by a combination of careful production control and processing. Air-cooled blast furnace slag is non-expansive.

Iron production is via a continuous batch process with the iron and slag produced in the blastfurnace at a temperature around 1500ÂºC. The furnace is fed repeatedly with materials in a sequence of a 'coke dump', followed by a 'ferrous dump'. The 'ferrous dump' typically consists of a pre-blend of mainly sinter, but also graded lump iron ore and

Refractory concrete is not an alternative to fire brick, but it is the perfect mortar to use on the interior of your fire pit. Bricks that shouldn't be used in fire pits Wet rocks cause trapped air and water to expand quickly. Add in heat from a fire and the expansion occurs even faster. The pressure from this is what causes rocks to explode.

An air-cooled BF is predominantly crystalline in nature, with a cellular or vesicular structure resulting from bubbles of gases that were dissolved in the molten slag. The air-cooled slag crushes to angular, roughly cubical particles with pitted surfaces. Excellent bond is provided with either hydraulic cements or bituminous binder materials.

The water absorption of air cooled can be as high as 6 %.

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

The multitude of slag uses is well-beyond the theme of this article. I'd like to take a look at 4 common heavy highway uses of slag. 1. Air-Cooled Blast Furnace Slag (ACBFS) ACBFS is produced when the molted liquid slag is, as its name infers, is allowed to cool atmospherically. The cooled mass is then crushed to produce a graded aggregate.

Nickel Slag Air-cooled nickel slag is brownish-black in color. It crushes to angular particles but has a smooth, glassy texture. The specific gravity of air-cooled nickel slag may be as high as 3.5 (15), while the absorption is quite low (0.37 percent). (3) The unit weight of nickel slag is somewhat higher than that of conventional aggregate.
