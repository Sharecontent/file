## How aluminum is made - material, manufacture, making, used, processing 
Aluminum compounds occur in all types of clay, but the ore that is most useful for producing pure aluminum is bauxite. Bauxite consists of 45-60% aluminum oxide, along with various impurities such as sand, iron, and other metals. Although some bauxite deposits are hard rock, most consist of relatively soft dirt that is easily dug from open-pit

## Bauxite Beneficiation: Efficient Way to Remove Silica in Bauxite
The main component of bauxite is Al 2 O 3, containing a small amount of Fe 2 O 3, SiO 2, and other impurities. The main objective of bauxite beneficiation is to lower the concentration of reactive silica, and also to increase the alumina content. In addition, bauxite beneficiation can also be used for iron extraction or iron removal.

## TENORM: Bauxite and Alumina Production Wastes | US EPA
Bauxite is used to produce alumina, which is then used to produce aluminum. Wastes can be generated at several points in the production process, including during the mining of the bauxite ore, and during the refinery production process. The refinery processes used to produce aluminum generates about 2 - 2.5 tons of solid waste for every 1 ton
