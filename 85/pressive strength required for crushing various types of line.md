## types of cement and their compressive strength
Types Of Cement And Their Compressive Strength. The strength of the mix is specified as M5, M10, M15, M20, M25, M30, etc, where M signifies Mix and 5, 10, 15, etc as their strength in kN/m 2In the United States, concrete strength, For each type of coarse aggregate 75 cubes 150x150mm were cast to allow the compressive strength to be monitored at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days

## Crushing in Mineral Processing
In mineral processing or metallurgy, the first stage of comminution is crushing. Depending of the type of rock ( geometallurgy) to be crushed, there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks. In principle, compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear-resistant plate
