Gold is an ore of low value unless you are of low money, requiring at least a Stone Pickaxe to mine the ore. It has the same texture as Copper, however the ore is switched horizontally. The colour of the ore is yellow and shiny, making it look very precious and valuable. Due to its value, it can be first found close to the surface.
