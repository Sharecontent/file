Overview. African chrome is produced from the Bushveld Complex in South Africa, which has 80% of global reserves and produces approximately 50% of global chromite. Nearly all of Zimbabwe's chrome production is sourced from the Great Dyke and consumed for local ferrochrome plants. Madagascar also has a small chromite mining industry.
