## An Overview of the Five Stages of Gold Mining - MiningNewsWire
To a casual observer, mining gold seems simple: find ore, extract it then process it into gold. However, this isn't the case since mining for gold is a more complex process which occurs in stages.. Before the precious metal can be extracted, firms are required to explore the area in order to accurately determine the size of the deposit and how the ore can be extracted and processed

The environmental effects of gold mining are devastating. Gold mining generates inconceivable amounts of waste. Every 40 seconds, gold mining produces the weight of the Eiffel Tower in waste. In less than 5 days, you could cover the city of Paris with "Waste" Towers. The true price of jewelry. About 50% of all gold is made into jewelry.

Color is vibration; some colors are healing, some are stimulating, and others work against the healing process. Gold is warm and dilates the tissues and relaxes the injured area, permitting repair to be a little faster. Some kings and queens would wear a crown of gold on their heads or a gold band that would go around the entire head.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.
