## Open-pit mining
Open-pit mining, also known as open-cast or open-cut mining and in larger contexts mega-mining, is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth from an open-air pit, sometimes known as a borrow.. This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth, such as long wall mining.Open-pit mines are used when deposits of commercially

## Open Pit Mining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Open pit mining refers to mining directly on the ground surface, thereby producing an open pit. This method is practical and cost-effective when the uranium ore is located near the surface (e.g., within 100 m). Underground mining and ISL methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths.
