The factors that affect gold leaching include grinding fineness, pH, temperature, cyanide dosage, pulp-solid-liquid ratio, leaching time, impurities in ore and amount of leaching aid and so on. This article will discuss how grinding fineness influence gold leaching process and its related problems and improvement methods.

The use of alkaline pressure oxidation to pretreat refractory gold ore often results in insufficient gold recovery (<60%) in downstream thiosulfate leaching. To improve gold recovery, flotation was considered for the separation of carbonaceous matter (C-matter). In this study, the effect of MIBC on C-matter flotation was investigated to understand the role of the frother in bubble and froth

2) Use carrier flotation, using the ore particles of general flotation size as a carrier, so that the fine particle of target mineral cover is floating on the carrier. The carrier may be of the same type or a heterogeneous mineral. For example, pyrite may be used as a carrier for flotation of fine gold.

## Effect of Particle Size and Grinding Time on Gold Dissolution in  - MDPI
The recovery of gold by ore leaching is influenced by the size of the particles and the chemical environment. The effect of particle size on the dissolution of gold is usually studied using mono-size particles as the gold in solution comes from the ore of a unique leached particle size. This paper proposes a method to estimate the gold dissolution as a function of particle size using a bulk

## 7 Factors Affecting Froth Flotation Process - JXSC Machine
1 Grinding Particle Size. Both large ore particles (larger than 0.1mm) and small ore particles (less than 0.006mm) affect flotation efficiency and mineral recovery. In the case of flotation coarse particles, due to the heavyweight, it is not easy to suspend in the flotation machine, and the chance of collision with the bubbles is reduced.

## Effect of particles size range on iron ore flotation
Flotation is one of the main concentration processes being employed for many classes of minerals (sulfides, oxides, silicates, phosphates, for example) at different particle sizes. In the iron ore industry, reverse quartz flotation has been successfully employed for particle sizes below ISOfim after the desliming process. The high demand for iron ore products has made flotation the main

##  The effect of particle size distribution on froth stability in flotation
a platinum ore in a lab based study that particle size had a significant effect on froth stability with fine particles of approximately 30 - 40 µm increasing froth stability at low air rates. Conversely, Tao et al. (2000) observed that coal particles of less than 30 µm diameter
