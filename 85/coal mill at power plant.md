## What are Coal feeders? Principle, components.
What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).. The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume fraction.
