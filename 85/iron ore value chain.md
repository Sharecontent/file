## Iron ore classification - Process productivity
A powerful iron ore classification system is a critical prerequisite. Without a sufficiently and appropriately characterised resource, modelling will be inaccurate reducing an organisations ability to implement cost reductions and productivity gains across the iron ore value chain.

## FOCUS: Complexity of iron ore market underlines value of derivatives
The growth of iron ore trading activities at Chinese ports over the past few years is also an important factor that affects supply-demand dynamics, and in turn prices for seaborne cargoes. In recent weeks, the dwindling of port stock has kept seaborne iron ore prices elevated despite mills' steadily narrowing margins.

2. The Manganese Value Chain: Stylized Facts Manganese possesses chemical properties that make it an ideal input into the making of alloys. It is commonly obtained through manganese ore in the form of manganese oxide (also known as pyrolusite), or through iron ores. Manganese production is thus often subsumed under iron mining.
