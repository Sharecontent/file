## What is Concentration of Ore? Definition, Physical & Chemical Methods 
The ore concentration is defined as the chemical process of eliminating impurities like sand, rocks, silt, grit etc. from the ore to extract the metals. In simple words, the concentration of ore is the method of separating ore from the gangue, as the gangue or matrix particles are the valueless substances that are of no use.
