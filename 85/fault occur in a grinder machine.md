## Troubleshooting Common Electric Coffee Grinder Problems
Avoid operating the grinder when the bowl does not contain the coffee beans, as this will make the blade spin rapidly and cause damage to the motor. To avoid overheating of the grinder's motor, don't grind for longer than 30 seconds at a time. Avoid immersing the electric coffee grinder in water because this will ruin the motor of the machine.

## Grinding Machine || Definition,Working,Parts,Operation&Types
A grinding is metal cutting operation which is performed by means of a rotating abrasive wheel that acts as a tool. These are mostly used to finish workpieces which must show a high surface quality, accuracy of shape and dimension. Mostly, it is finishing operation because it removes material in very small size of chips 0.25 - 0.5 mm.
