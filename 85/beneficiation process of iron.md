paramagnetic minerals such as iron and magnetite. High intensity magnetic separators (HIMS) generally have field strengths of 10 to 20 kilogauss. These separators are used to treat weakly magnetic minerals, such as hematite. Magnetic separators are commonly classified into two broad groups, namely, wet and dry based on their usage.

## Beneficiation
Iron beneficiation has been evident since as early as 800 BC in China with the use of bloomery. A bloomery is the original form of smelting and allowed people to make fires hot enough to melt oxides into a liquid that separates from the iron.  Where the DMS occurs in the process can be important, the grinders or mills will process much less

## Ore Beneficiation - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
Any microbially induced beneficiation process will prove to be cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environment-friendly compared to chemical alternatives which use toxic chemicals.  Utility of four types of microorganisms in iron ore beneficiation through microbially induced flotation and flocculation is demonstrated in this section
