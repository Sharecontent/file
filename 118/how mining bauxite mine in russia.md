## The Process of Mining Bauxite - Dajcor
Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Milling: Several meters of rock and clay are removed by blasting, drilling, and bulldozers. The bauxite is then transported to the crushing and washing area, reducing the particle size and increasing the available surface area for the digestion stage.

The British Guiana mines started shipments in 1917 and the Surinam mines in 1922. Somewhat later, bauxite was discovered in Hungary and was developed for the benefit of the German aluminum plants. Bauxite production began in Russia in the late twenties. During the past 15 years it has continued at a high and increasing rate.
