Over 300 minerals contain iron but five minerals are the primary sources of iron ore. They are (i) magnetite (Fe3O4), (ii) hematite (Fe2O3), (iii) goethite (Fe2O3.H2O), (iv) siderite (FeCO3), and (v) pyrite (FeS2). The first three are of major importance because of their occurrence in large economically minable deposits.

## How Is Iron Ore Mined From The Ground - Realonomics
Ore is extracted from the earth through mining and treated or refined often via smelting to extract the valuable metals or minerals. The grade of ore refers to the concentration of the desired material it contains. How does iron ore get mined? Most iron ores are extracted by surface mining.Some underground mines do exist but wherever possible surface mining is preferred because it is cheaper.

## Iron Ore | Energy & Mining
Low-grade ore. Low-grade ore is a term applied to iron-rich rocks with cut-off grades in the range of 25ï¿½30% Fe. It was the main supply of iron ore for many centuries of the World's early history of production of iron. Since the 1950s North America's main supply has been low-grade ore.

## Geology and mining — MineFacts
In general, ore can be divided into three types: sulphide ore, iron ore and gold ore. The types of ore differ among other things in how they are processed, their composition and their general environmental impact.  iron mines contain around 50 per cent iron bearing mineral, while a copper mine perhaps contains only 0.5-1.5 per cent copper
