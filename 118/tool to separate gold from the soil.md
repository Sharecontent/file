## Phytomining: Can plants really grow gold? - Manhattan Gold & Silver
The method of using plants to extract particles of gold from soil is called phytomining. It works by taking a fast-growing plant with leafy mass, such as mustard, sunflowers or tobacco, and planting the crop on soil that contains gold. Once the plants grow to their maximum height, the soil is then treated with a chemical to make the gold soluble.

## Methods for Separating Mixtures | Chemistry for Non-Majors - Course Hero
One of the approaches taken to isolate the gold from the soil was called "panning." Dirt would be placed in the pan and covered with water. After thorough mixing, the pan is gently swirled to remove dissolved material while the heavier gold settles to the bottom of the pan. The gold is then separated from the mixture of soil and water.

The gold thus obtained is usually of a fineness of about 997 or 998, the remainder being chiefly silver, which would not pay for extraction although part of it could be separated with a further expenditure of time, fuel, and acid. The gold is pressed by a hydraulic ram, the pressure exerted being about 800 lbs. to the square inch.
