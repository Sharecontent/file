The early mining efforts at Cripple Creek where primarily from placer mining operations which started when gold was first found in the area around 1859. It took several more decades, after the placer deposits began to be depleted, that interest in the hard rock ores started being developed. In the Mount Pisgah area some unique gold ores were found.

The mineral value on the claim is gold. Light panning in the creek behind the cabin produced small grains of gold. An average small operation could reasonably expect to extract 1-1.5 oz per day if processing 1 ton per day. The region is also known for its gold production, though the larger, well-known gold mines are located much farther north.
