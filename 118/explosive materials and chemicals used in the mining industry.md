## Industrial explosives - a brief history of their development and use
Typical chemical explosives release about 5000 J (5 kJ) of heat energy per gram; 0.02 g of such an explosive would release heat energy equivalent to the kinetic energy carried by the baseball. A single gram of chemical explosive can release heat energy equivalent to that needed in rais- ing a small automobile (1000 kg) about 50 centimeters.

## Explosives Used in Mining: Properties, Types, Transport, Storage 
Most of the high explosives, permitted explosives and slurry explosives used in the mines have a velocity of detonation ranging between 2500 and 5000 metres per second. For high explosives which are used as boosters, the V.O.D. is high, e.g. O.C.G. - 6000 m/s; Primer - 7000 m/s.
