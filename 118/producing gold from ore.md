## Gold extraction
Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing, resulting in direct recovery of small gold nuggets and flakes. Placer mining techniques since the mid to late 20th century have generally only been the practice of artisan miners.

What does gold look like in ore? The color of pure Gold is bright golden yellow but the greater the silver content the whiter its color is. Much of the gold mined is actually from gold ore rather then actual Gold specimens. The ore is often brown iron-stained rock or massive white Quartz and usually contains only minute traces of gold.
