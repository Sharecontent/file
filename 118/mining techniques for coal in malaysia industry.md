## History explorer: Britain's coal industry | HistoryExtra
Although the coal industry still employed around 700,000 mineworkers in Britain during the 1940s and 1950s - and even as late as the early to mid-1980s boasted a workforce of around 200,000 - the decline seemed irreversible. In 1981, mining strikes looked likely after Margaret Thatcher's conservative government proposed further pit closures.

## coal mining techniques
Coal mining . Some coal mining began before 1900, but the most productive coal mining techniques didn't develop until after the turn of the century, including the first conveyor belt and mechanized coal loading. Bituminous coal overtook anthracite in the mid-1800s. In the 1960s, smaller coal companies merged into larger, more diversified firms.

Mining can occur either at Earth's surface in strip mines or open pit mines, or beneath the surface in underground mines. The method used depends on the depth, lateral extent, and economic value of the rock being mined. The deepest underground mine on Earth, which is 2.4 mi (3.8 km) deep, is a South African gold mine.
