## 2 Types Of Commonly Used Copper Oxide Processing Methods
Nov 9, 2021Copper oxide is a kind of copper ore with complex and changeable properties and difficult to process, which is often abandoned in the past due to high processing cost and difficulty in separation. With the continuous development of social economy, the demand for copper is also increasing,so the development and utilization of oxide copper are widely concerned now.
