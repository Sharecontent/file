##  Assessment of Waste Dump Slope Stability at Iron Ore Mines
Abstract: - The iron ore mining in India is becoming increasingly significant with an ever-growing target of iron production from the mines. As a result, waste generation due to mining activity goes on increasing day by day.  The preparation process is shown in Figures 3. Figure 3: Mould filled with sample Figure 4: Sealing of the sample to

## Iron ore
Mining of banded iron formations involves coarse crushing and screening, followed by rough crushing and fine grinding to comminute the ore to the point where the crystallized magnetite and quartz are fine enough that the quartz is left behind when the resultant powder is passed under a magnetic separator.

Iron ores occur in igneous, metamorphic (transformed), or sedimentary rocks in a variety of geologic environments. Most are sedimentary, but many have been changed by weathering, and so their precise origin is difficult to determine. The most widely distributed iron-bearing minerals are oxides, and iron ores consist mainly of hematite (Fe2O3), which is red; magnetite (Fe3O4), which is black

Regions in which iron ore has formed over millions of years (e.g. through volcanism) and can be mined economically are also referred to as iron ore deposits. Especially many ore deposits can be found in countries such as China, Australia, Brazil, India and Russia. These countries account for around 85 % of the total global iron ore mining volume.

In the state of Odisha, 17 leases for noncaptive iron ore mines are set to expire on March 31, 2020, based on 2015 amendments to India's Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. The leases for these mines, which produce some 60 million tonnes per year out of Odisha's total annual production of 107 million tonnes (2018) will not be renewed—instead, they will be auctioned.

The pig iron itself does not have much use but it finds a great number of applications when converted into steel alloys in the steel industry. The process of manufacturing pig iron is a bit complicated. The following steps explain the same as simply as possible. Raw Materials-The raw materials used in the blast furnace to produce high-quality pig iron are iron-ore, coke, limestone, and sinter. Now, these iron ores are nothing but oxides of iron that contains other materials like limonite

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Haematite and magnetite are the most commonly found iron ore minerals. The smelting process allows the iron ore to be heated with carbon. The carbon combines with the oxygen and carries it away, leaving behind iron. Blast furnaces are so hot which is why they melt the iron, and drain it off to be poured into moulds to form bars, called ingots.

Beneficiation: Beneficiation is the process which improves the economic value of the ore by removing gangue minerals. The Committee noted that there has been a continuous depletion of high-grade iron ore in India. Hence, it is necessary to beneficiate low-grade iron ore into commercial-grade to fulfil the demand for raw material for steel making.

## Iron Ore Deposit of Orissa-Jharkhand Region (With Map) | India | Metallurgy
Since times of the Jones (1934) the Iron ore deposits of Orissa and Jharkhand have received great attention due of their being high grade and large size. Here mining is done by simple quarrying. If the present day production of a very high scale, these ore deposits continue at this rate, then they would be exhausted in the near future.
