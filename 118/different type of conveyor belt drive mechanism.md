## How Does A Conveyor Belt Work - Realonomics
How do conveyor systems work. Typically conveyor systems consist of a belt stretched across two or more pulleys. The belt forms a closed loop around the pulleys so it can continually rotate. One pulley known as the drive pulley drives or tows the belt moving items from one location to another. How do roller conveyor belts work?

## Conveyor belt
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with a closed loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt

In belt drives, power is transmitted between at least two pulleys by a belt. One pulley drives the belt ( driving pulley) and the other pulley is driven by the belt ( driven pulley ). In belt drives, the speed is often reduced, so that in these cases the smaller of the two pulleys is the driving pulley. Figure: Operating principle of a belt drive.
