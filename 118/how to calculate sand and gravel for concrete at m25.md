The water to cement ratio is calculated by dividing the water in one cubic yard of the mix ( in pounds) by the cement in the mix (in pounds). So if one cubic yard of the mix has 235 pounds of water and 470 pounds of cement - the mix is a .50 water to cement ratio . If the mix lists the water in gallons, multiply the gallons by 8.33 to find how.

Bulking of Sand - If the moisture is present in the sand, then it makes the sand look bulkier, which could result in inadequate sand proportion in the concrete ratio. If we need to add 1m 3 sand in the concrete mix ratio, we take 1.3 m 3 (30% more). The reason for that is the moisture content present in the sand makes it a little bulkier. The

So, Sand required = 0.0721600 = 115 kgs. and Aggregate required = 0.1441450 = 209 kgs. Considering water/cement (W/C) ratio of 0.55. We can also arrive at the Water required = 500.55 = 27.5 kg. So, One bag of cement (50 Kgs) has to be mixed with 115 kgs of Sand, 209 Kgs of aggregate and 27.5 kgs of water to produce M20 grade concrete.

## M25 Concrete Ratio Calculation
M25 Concrete Cement Required Volume of cement = (Cement Proportion / Sum of Ratio) x Dry Volume of Concrete. Cement = (1/4) x 1.54 = 0.385 cubic meter As we know that density of Cement is 1.44 gm/cm 3 or 1440 kg/m3 Therefore, multiply volume of cement with its specific gravity to get weight of cement

## How much cement sand & aggregate required for m25 concrete
Ans. :-624 Kgs quantity of sand is required for 1 cubic metre of M25 concrete. How much sand required for M25 concrete in cft step 9 :-calculate sand required for 1 cubic metre of M25 concrete in cft (cubic feet) is equal to 1/4 × 1.54m3/35.3147 × 1620 Kg/m3 = 18 cft. Ans.:- 18 cft quantity of sand is required for 1 cubic metre of M25 concrete.

## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement, Sand  - CivilNotePpt
Quantity of sand required = ( Sand ratio ÷ Sum of all ratio) × Total volume of concrete = = 1.386 m 3 Our totat quantity of sand is 1.386 m 3, but in CFT (cubic feet) it will be ( 1.386 × 35.31) = 48.93 ≈ 49 CFT ( cubic feet) [ Note: 1 m 3 = 35.31 CFT or cubic feet ]

## How to Calculate Cement, Sand and Coarse Aggregate Quantity in Concrete 
Concrete parts = 1+1.5+3 = 5.5 Parts Density of sand = kg/cum Sand = (1.5/5.5) x 1.54 = 0.42 Density of Cement = 1500 kg/ m3 = 0.42 X 1500 = 630 kg But we all are buying sand in cft Therefore, 1 Cum = 35.31 Cft Sand Quantity = 0.42 = 0.42 x 35.31= 14.83 Cft 100 cft = 1 Unit 2.83 cum = 1 unit 1 load - 4 unit
