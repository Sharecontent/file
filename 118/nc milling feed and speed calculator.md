## Milling Speed and Feed Calculator
Determine the spindle speed (RPM) and feed rate (IPM) for a milling operation, as well as the cut time for a given cut length. Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth, such as an end mill or face mill. Calculations use the desired tool diameter, number of teeth, cutting speed, and
