## Sandstone
Sandstone is a clastic sedimentary rock composed mainly of sand-sized (0.0625 to 2 mm) silicate grains. Sandstones comprise about 20-25% of all sedimentary rocks.. Most sandstone is composed of quartz or feldspar (both silicates) because they are the most resistant minerals to weathering processes at the Earth's surface. Like uncemented sand, sandstone may be any color due to impurities

The rock samples used in the test were Hawkesbury sandstone, which obtained from Gosford Quarry in Sydney, Australia. The quartz sandstones which contained a small quantity of feldspars, siderite, and clay minerals were formed in marine sedimentary basin of the mid-Triassic, and located on the top of coal-bearing strata. The surface of specimen exhibited local red rather than white because of the content and distribution of iron oxide.

Description. Sandstone is a sedimentary rock composed mostly of quartz sand, but it can also contain significant amounts of feldspar, and sometimes silt and clay. Sandstone that contains more than 90% quartz is called quartzose sandstone. When the sandstone contains more than 25% feldspar, it is called arkose or arkosic sandstone.
