## Crushed Stone Calculator
Apr 26, 2022Here's how you can use the crushed stone calculator: Select your surface shape, e.g., Rectangular. In surface length, enter the length of your surface, e.g., 12 feet. In surface width, enter the width of your surface, e.g., 8 feet. Now, enter in depth, how deep do you want to fill the layout of your surface, e.g., 3 inches.

## The density of gravel - gravel, granite, limestone and slag. Bulk 
This is important to know. The density, from which the crushed stone is made, also influences the density. With the same volume - 1 m 3, the weight of the granite will be 2.6 tons. However, limestone due to impurities of quartz, dolomites, etc. - 2.7-2.9 tons. With the same weight, the volume will vary.

The density of crushed stone 20/40 is in the range of kg / m 3. Stones 40/70 are similar to the previous ones - kg / m 3 . It is difficult to confuse granite crushed stone with other types: stones are characteristic from dark gray to pinkish, shades are caused by the inclusion of different minerals in the base rock.

The relative density (specific gravity) of an aggregate is the ratio of its mass to the mass of an equal volume of water. Relative Density = Mass of the Aggregate / Mass of equal volume of water. Key Features: Most aggregates have a relative density between 2.4-2.9 with a corresponding particle (mass) density of kg/m 3 ( lb/ft 3).

Crushed limestone can be used as rip rap to prevent shore erosion. The number "57" is a number that refers to the size sieve that was used to screen and sort the stone. It means that the stone was put through the #57 sieve which produces gravel stones of about 1" to 1.5" in size. #1 crushed stone refers to the largest sized crushed
