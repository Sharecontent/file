Electrolytic refining (electrorefining) is a process used to make impure copper pure. Unlike aluminum, copper metal is fairly easy to obtain chemically from its ores. By electrolysis, it can be refined and made very pureâ€”up to 99.999%. The electrorefining is at the heart of not only copper purification, but the production of sodium hydroxide and chlorine.

In refining copper, an aqueous solution of copper (II) sulphate is electrolyzed, using impure copper as the anode and pure copper as the cathode. At the anode, metal impurities higher than copper in the electrochemical series such as zinc, iron and lead are oxidized first, then copper loses its electrons to form copper (II) ions.

## During the process of electrolytic refining of copper?
How is the electro refining of impure copper done? Electrolytic Refining Electrorefining entails electrochemically dissolving copper from impure copper anodes into an electrolyte containing CuSO 4 and H 2 SO 4 and then electrochemically depositing pure copper from the electrolyte onto stainless steel or copper cathodes. The process is continuous.

When current is applied to the electrolysis cell copper (II) ions in solution are reduced to copper atoms at the cathode. Copper atoms on the anode are oxidized to copper (II) ions. The cathode gains mass, the anode looses mass. When the experiment ends, the electrodes are dried and the mass of each electrode weighed on the mini-balance.

## Copper Refining - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
In the electrolytic process, copper is electrodeposed to obtain a spongy powder deposit at the cathode rather than a smooth, adherent one. In this feature, it differs from the process of copper refining where a strongly adherent product is desired. Low copper ion concentration and high acid content in the electrolyte favor formation of powder deposits.

The object of refining copper in the reverberatory furnace is to obtain a metal which will have the highest attainable degree of malleability, ductility and electric conductivity, and present at the same time a level surface when it solidifies in the mold after casting. These desirable physical properties are governed by the character of the impurities and the forms in which they are present, by the amount of cuprous oxide retained by the copper, by the quantity of gas held in solid solution

## Global tellurium supply potential from electrolytic copper refining
In this analysis, we estimate the quantity of tellurium contained in anode slimes generated by electrolytic copper refining by country between 1986 and 2018, including uncertainties. For 2018, the results indicate that 1930 (, 95% confidence interval) metric tons of tellurium were contained in anode slimes globally.

## Refining (metallurgy)
Electrolytic refining [ edit] The purest copper is obtained by an electrolytic process, undertaken using a slab of impure copper as the anode and a thin sheet of pure copper as the cathode. The electrolyte is an acidic solution of copper sulphate.
