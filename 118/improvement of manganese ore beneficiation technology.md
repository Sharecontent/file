A Case Study ofthe Production ofHigh-grade Manganese . tural industries. sales of manganese are are largely depen­ dent on steel production. The use of manganese dropped steadily from 40 to 34 kg ofare per ton of steel from 1950 to 1985, although this was expected to be reversed by the use of the optimizing refining process (ORP), which uses manganese ore at the cost of ferromanganese alloys2.

## Manganese ore beneficiation methods and equipment summary!
For manganese ore, the density of manganese oxide ore (such as anhydrite, pyrolusite and brown manganese ore) is about 4G / cm3, which is significantly different from that of silicate gangue. Most of them can be separated by gravity separation. However, the density difference between manganese carbonate ore and gangue is relatively small.

The common methods are heavy medium beneficiation, jigging beneficiation and shaking bed beneficiation. At present, the technological process of treating manganese oxide ore in our country usually breaks the ore to 6-0 mm or 10-0 mm, then divides the ore into groups, jigs the coarse grade and shaker the fine grade.

## Manganese phosphating process pdf
Chemetall's nickel-free manganese phosphate processes Gardobond® G 4004/10 is applied in a dip line process at a temperature range between 95 and 98 °C. Prior to the phosphating step a good activation process is essential. We recommend the use of our Gardolene® V 6560A activation technology in combination with our nickel-free manganese.

## Improve manganese leaching efficiency by adding different complexants 
1.Introduction. Manganese is an irreplaceable material in the steel industry (Sun et al., 2020, Sahoo et al., 2001).At present, about 95% of the manganese produced every year is used in the steel industry as a unique deoxidizing and desulfurizing agent to improve the quality of steel (Jacob et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2019).With the depletion of high-grade manganese ore resources, the
