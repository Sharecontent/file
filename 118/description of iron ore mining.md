Benefits of Open Pit Mining. Open pit mining (also known as strip mining) is the process of extracting ore, minerals and/or fossil fuels that occurs on the surface of a particular mining site. When considering all the mining operations in the world, at least 40 percent of mining takes place at the surface reports Greenpeace International.

Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.
