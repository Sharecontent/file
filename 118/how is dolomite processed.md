## Dolomite - Its Processing and Application in Iron and  - IspatGuru
Dolomite is an anhydrous carbonate mineral. It is a double carbonate of calcium and magnesium (CaCO3.MgCO3). It is one of the important raw materials used in production of iron and steel. Dolomite contains theoretically 54.35 % of CaCO3 and 45.65 % of MgCO3 or 30.41 % of CaO, 21.86 % of MgO, and 47.73 % of CO2.

Dolomite is a cheap, disposable catalyst that can significantly reduce the tar content of the product gas from a gasifier. It may be used as a primary catalyst, dry-mixed with biomass, or, more commonly, placed in a downstream reactor, in which case it is often referred to as a guard bed. View chapter Purchase book.

The dolomite rock is composed of calcium magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO3)2. Dolomite is produced through the dolomitization geological process. The Dolomite occupies approximately 2% of Earth's crust. Dolomite formation occurs under anaerobic conditions. The mineral occurs in the form of dolomite marble, dolomite carbonatite, and dolomite-rich

## Formation of the Dolomites
Big rock masses slid on top of others and created folds. The Dolomites had received their typical appearance due to the weathering process, as the different rock layers were eroded at different velocities. A typical characteristic of the Dolomites is the abrupt change between rugged rocks and hilly, green mountain pastures.

Transparent dolomite crystals are difficult for faceters to cut. Dolomites have a low and variable hardness of 3.5 to 4, which varies along its four crystal axes, as well as perfect cleavage. These factors also make it a fragile stone for jewelry use. They are more liable to scratch and break than most jewelry stones.

dolomite, type of limestone, the carbonate fraction of which is dominated by the mineral dolomite, calcium magnesium carbonate [CaMg(CO3)2]. Along with calcite and aragonite, dolomite makes up approximately 2 percent of the Earth's crust. The bulk of the dolomite constitutes dolostone formations that occur as thick units of great areal extent in many sequences of chiefly marine strata.

## The Dolomite Problem - Electric Universe Geology
The Dolomite Problem. The question of how the mineral dolomite, occurring in sedimentary rocks throughout the Earth, was created in large quantities has concerned the geology for over 200 years now - with only moderate success in explaining it. Dolomite was identified in 1791 by the French mineralogist Déodat de Dolomieu ().
