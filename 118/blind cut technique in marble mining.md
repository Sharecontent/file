First stage of marble processing: Mining . Nature is in charge of providing marble with its shape and colour for thousands of years. Therefore,  Marble cutting . Marble is cut using multiwire or block cutters. Depending on their dimensions, blocks may be cut using different methods, i.e., large blocks will be processed in the multi wire

The wire is then loaded, which means that it is repeatedly twisted on itself to prevent the pearls from being deformed during the cutting process. Cutting speed is in the range of 12 m2/h but varies based on the minerals present in the rock. When the base, back and side have been cut, the marble block is isolated from the remaining mass.

## From Quarry to Countertop: How Marble and Granite Are Mined
Aug 3, 2021This involves drilling holes in the marble from the top of the quarry and lining up another drill hole from the side. The marble is fed through these holes and connected to a machine that keeps tension on the wire as it slices through the marble. In certain cases, particularly when quarries are located inside mountains, a chainsaw-like mechanism is used. Oftentimes, a resin is applied to fill cracks throughout the marble's surface.
