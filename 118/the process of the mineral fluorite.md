## Fluorite
Hydrogen fluoride is liberated from the mineral by the action of concentrated sulfuric acid : CaF 2 ( s) + H 2 SO 4 → CaSO 4 (s) + 2 HF ( g) The resulting HF is converted into fluorine, fluorocarbons, and diverse fluoride materials. As of the late 1990s, five billion kilograms were mined annually. [32]
