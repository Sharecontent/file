## Mining Industry: What is the difference between jaw crusher and impact 
Answer (1 of 3): The jaw crusher is usually used for coarse, medium and fine crushing of various rocks, including limestone, shale, basalt, pebble, bluestone, etc. The impact crusher is usually used as a medium-hardness crusher, such as limestone and concrete, which has good crushing efficiency

## Impact Crusher vs. Jaw crusher, Which One Should I Choose
Jaw crushers are often used in primary crushing applications. Impact crushers are usually used for applications where the stone is softer, has a lower density and less abrasive. The high-speed rotating rotor throws the stone into the impact toggles, and the impact energy generated by the rotor breaks the rock along its natural fracture line.

## Impact Crushers VS Jaw Crushers
Compared with the impact crushers, jaw crushers use the compression force to break down materials. When the material is poured into the chamber and fall though chamber, it will be crushed 2 to 4 times. The reduction ratio of this machine is about 6:1. Besides the higher reduction ratios, the impact crushers is more useful to make a more cubical

## Impact Crusher | Description | Advantages - Engineering Intro
The word impact makes sense that in this particular type of crusher some impaction is being used for crushing of rocks. In normal types of crusher pressure is generated for the crushing of rocks. But, impact crushers involve an impact method. There is a hopper one side that takes the crushing material into the machine.

A jaw crusher is a machine used to crush rock and other hard and abrasive materials, such as granite, ore, or recycled concrete, usually for industrial use. The crushing unit consists of a fixed plate and an oscillating plate called a jaw, between which the rock is sandwiched and crushed. A motor and belt transmit the movement to the eccentric

## Tips on Choosing a Concrete Crusher for Demolition Contractors
While jaw crushers use pressure to break up concrete, impact crushers rely on impact (as their name implies). Some impact crushers throw the rock against hard surfaces with such velocity that the rocks naturally break along internal fissures. Other impact crushers use hammers on the outer edge of a spinning rotor to break up materials

Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.

## Cone Crusher vs. Impact Crusher | Quarrying & Aggregates
For cone crusher and jaw crusher, they crush stone by squeezing or compressing, which can easily break the stable content structure of hard stone, So it is more high-efficiency to crush hard stone. For impact crusher, the high-speed rotating rotor throw stone into impact plates, stones are crushed via impact energy produced rotating rotor.

A first-stage crusher, such as an impact or jaw crusher is used to break raw material down to a size that the cone crusher can accommodate. Cone crushers are typically looked at as a secondary or tertiary stage of crushing. But, they can also act as the first stage provided the material is small enough to fit through the feed opening.

I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.
