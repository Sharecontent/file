## How does coke and coal play into steel making?
Coke is used as a fuel and a reducing agent in melting iron ore. It is produced by baking coal until it becomes carbon by burning off impurities without burning up the coal itself. When coke is consumed it generates intense heat but little smoke, making it ideal for smelting iron and steel. Prior to the 1880's, steel was produced using charcoal.

Increased scrap use could erode metallurgical coal and iron ore consumption. Metallurgical coal is the primary driver of CO2 emissions in virgin iron production. Coal demand will decrease when environmental concerns come to the forefront of policy. High-cost miners exporting to Atlantic basin customers will be most at risk.
