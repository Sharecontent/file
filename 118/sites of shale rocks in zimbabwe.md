## Shale Rock: Geology, Composition, Uses - ThoughtCo
Shale is the most common sedimentary rock, accounting for about 70 percent of the rock in the Earth's crust. Shale is a fine-grained rock made from compacted mud and clay. The defining characteristic of shale is its ability to break into layers or fissility. Black and gray shale are common, but the rock can occur in any color.

Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that is formed when silt and clay are compressed. It is composed of many thin layers, and it readily splits into thin pieces where these layers meet—making it a relatively brittle stone. Shale is composed of small grains and various minerals along with organic particles.

## Investigation of hydrogeological conditions of a fractured shale 
The area is underlain by Turonian fractured shale rock intruded by basaltic rocks. Geological, hydrogeological and geophysical investigations were carried out in Yala Area (SE Nigeria) to delineate potential zones for future groundwater development. The area is underlain by Turonian fractured shale rock intruded by basaltic rocks

## Shale: Sedimentary Rock - Pictures, Definition & More - Geology
Shale is a rock composed mainly of clay-size mineral grains. These tiny grains are usually clay minerals such as illite, kaolinite, and smectite. Shale usually contains other clay-size mineral particles such as quartz, chert, and feldspar. Other constituents might include organic particles, carbonate minerals, iron oxide minerals, sulfide
