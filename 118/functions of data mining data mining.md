The three-dimensional (3D) structure of chromatin has a massive effect on its function. Because of this, it is desirable to have an understanding of the 3D structural organization of chromatin. To gain greater insight into the spatial organization of chromosomes and genomes and the functions they perform, chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, particularly Hi-C, have been developed.
