More. The current turbulence in the mining industry in South Africa has its roots in several different factors. First, the fall in global demand for platinum and other minerals due to recession; second, the consequences of the Marikana disaster in destabilising labour relations; and third, the structural character of our mining industry.

Abstract. Mining in southern Africa has a long pre-colonial history. Haematite mining in Swaziland can be traced back more than 40,000 years, iron smelting dates from 400 AD or earlier, and copper from 900 AD. The most iconic evidence for pre-colonial mining are the gold artefacts from Mapungubwe dated between 1220 and 1300 AD.

## Africa: Minerals and Mining - Geography
Iron mining began in sub-Saharan Africa by around 500 B.C. and had spread through the region by the A.D. 200s. Iron played a crucial role in the improvement of agricultural tools and weapons.  The fabled gold mines of south-central Africa lured Portuguese explorers into the continent's interior in the late 1400s and 1500s.
