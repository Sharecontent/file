## What is a tripper conveyor? | SKE FAQ - SKE machinery
The belt conveyor tripper car is a separate component of the belt conveyor, which is mainly used in the occasions where the belt conveyor has different unloading ponits requirements. Its function is the same as the unloader, but it can realize multi-points unloading in different places. It is more convenient to use, but the relative cost is higher, suitable for use on large belt conveyors.
