To convert into cement bags - (0.581 x 1440)/50 = 16.7 Bags. Unit weigh of Cement - 1440 Kg/m3 1 bag cement - 50 Kg. Required Sand Volume = 3/4 x 1.55 (Bulkage & Wastage) x Mortar Volume. = 3/4 x 1.55 x 1.5 = 1.74 m3. So the required quantity of material for 100 sqm plastering with mortar thickness 15mm & mix ratio 1:3 is.

1) Calculating the dry volume of Mortar. The dry volume of mortar is measured for determining the quantity of cement and sand for the formation of mortar for our masonry work. The volume of Mortar = Plaster Area x Plaster thickness in Meter. Let's assume that the plaster area is 100 meters square, so we have got.

Now we will calculate the number of cement bags required for 10 square meter areas of plaster. Consider the cement mortar ratio 1:4. Cement quantity = 0.2/ (1 + 4) = 0.04 cubic metre. One is the proportion of cement, and 4 is the proportion of sand in cement mortar 1:4 ratio. Add wastage of 3% = 0.04 × 3% = 0.0012 cubic metre.

## How to Calculate the Quantity of Cement Mortar In Brickwork and Plaster 
Jul 1, is the number of the bricks required in 1-m3 with mortar. It means mortar volume is also calculated in the calculations. So we have to find out the actual numbers of bricks & the QTY of mortar. Actual volume of the Brick = 500 x (0.19 × 0.09 × 0.09) = 0.7695 m3. Volume of the Mortar = 1 - 0.7695 = 0.2305 m3.

## Calculation of Cement and Sand for Plastering Excel Sheet | Brick 
Mortar joints in brick masonry. There are two ways a couple of bricks can be joined together - vertically or horizontally. A bed is the mortar placed horizontally below bricks to join them (or the beam/slab) vertically. And the mortar placed in-between bricks laying on the same bed side-by-side is called prepend, that joins them horizontally.
