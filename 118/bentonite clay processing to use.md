## Mining and processing | Bentonite
Bentonite production process features ore mining, sodium activation - if required -, drying, and milling. Sodium activation is performed to convert calcium bentonite to sodium bentonite, in which calcium ions are exchanged for sodium carbonate. Through drying, bentonite natural moisture content of about 25-35% is reduced.
