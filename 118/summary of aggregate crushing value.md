Step-4 : Weigh the container full of aggregate. Step-5 : Calculate the net mass of aggregate in the measuring cylinder to an accurate of 1 gram. This quantity of aggregate constitutes the test specimen. Step-6 : Transfer the whole of this weighed specimen to the test mould by filling it in three layers as explained in Step-2.

The aggregate crushing value is an indirect measure of crushing strength of the aggregates. Low aggregate crushing value indicates strong aggregates, as the crushed fraction is low. Thus the test can be used to assess the suitability of aggregates with reference to the crushing strength for various types of pavement components.
