The manufacturing process of this aggregate involves agglomeration in a slightly moist environment on an inclined rotating pan. The resulting pellets (10-14 mm in diameter) are then dried and subsequently fed into a rotary kiln or grate furnace, at temperatures between 1100°C and 1200°C, at which a degree of bloating occurs, resulting in a
