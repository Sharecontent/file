## Mineral Resources: Reserves, Peak Production and the Future
The adequacy of mineral resources in light of population growth and rising standards of living has been a concern since the time of Malthus (1798), but many studies erroneously forecast impending peak production or exhaustion because they confuse reserves with "all there is". Reserves are formally defined as a subset of resources, and even current and potential resources are only a small

Around 90 percent of total iron ore reserves worldwide are held only by 15 countries. It is estimated that worldwide there are 800 billion tons of iron ore resources, containing more than 230 billion tons of iron. The good quality iron ores are Magnetite and Hematite. Magnetite is the finest iron ore with a very high content of iron up to 70 percent.

## Mined into extinction: is the world running out of critical minerals 
Now abandoned, Ivigt√ªt once contained the world's largest known reserves of naturally occurring cryolite. First described in 1798, this rare mineral was primarily used in aluminium extraction, but also as an insecticide and pesticide, to make caustic soda and even to give fireworks a yellow colour. And then in 1987 the mine simply ran out.

Key facts. In 2020, Canada was the eighth-largest producer of iron ore in the world. Canada's iron ore is mined in Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nunavut. The top three iron ore-producing countries (Australia, Brazil and China) accounted for 69% of global production. The primary use of iron ore is to make steel, which is 100% recyclable.

Iron is an important basic resource for national economic development in China. It is of great strategic importance for the sustainable development of China's economy to study the utilization and circulation status of iron resources. In this paper, using the material flow and value chain analysis method, we quantitatively analyzed the value flow of iron resources in China.
