## Minerals on the Edge - Plate Boundaries and Minerals
Minerals associated with mid-ocean ridges include iron, zinc, copper, lead, gold, and silver. Historic examples of volcanic massive sulphide deposits include the Troodos copper-iron complex in Cyprus. The massive sulphides and related stockwork occurs within a basaltic pillow lava sequence. Similar mineralisation occurs in Semail, Oman.

Petzite is a telluride of silver, Ag2Te, in which the silver is partly replaced by gold. A specimen from the Golden Rule Mine, according to Genth, contained tellurium 32.68 per cent., silver 41.86 per cent., and gold 25.60 per cent. It occurs in Transylvania, Chili, California, Colorado, and Utah.

## minerals associated with silver
Silver‐Bearing and Associated Minerals in El Zancudo  Native silver is present in minor amounts as small grains (up to 20 μm) in contact with Ag‐rich sulfosalts, and thus is considered to be a breakdown product of the Ag‐sulfosalts. The gangue minerals are quartz, calcite, and clay minerals, in order of decreasing abundance.

## A review of silver-rich mineral deposits and their metallogeny
Mineral deposits with large inventories or high grades of silver are found in four genetic groups: (1) volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS), (2) sedimentary exhalative (SEDEX), (3) lithogene, and, (4) magmatichydrothermal. Principal differences between the four groups relate to source rocks and regions, metal associations, process and timing of mineralization, and tectonic setting.

## 9 Ore Deposits and Economic Minerals - Mineralogy - OpenGeology
The best metal ore minerals are those that contain large amounts of metals of value. Most metallic ore minerals are native elements, sulfides, sulfosalts, oxides, or hydroxides. Ore deposits are highly variable in nature and origin. The most important kinds of ore deposits are magmatic, hydrothermal, and sedimentary.

mineral deposit, aggregate of a mineral in an unusually high concentration. About half of the known chemical elements possess some metallic properties. The term metal, however, is reserved for those chemical elements that possess two or more of the characteristic physical properties of metals (opacity, ductility, malleability, fusibility) and are also good conductors of heat and electricity

Silver mainly exists as independent minerals. Various compounds of silver and sulfur, copper, lead, tin, antimony, bismuth, selenium, arsenic and other elements appear in various deposits. Commonly, there are argentite-acanthite, jalpaite, pyrargyrite, stephanite, proustite, polybasite, andorite, diaphorite, hessite and naumannite.

In Mineral Processing Design and Operations (Second Edition), 2016. 7.1 Introduction. The usual objective of reducing the size of run-of mine ore pieces is to separate the mineral of interest contained in the ore body from associated gangue minerals. As crushing only does not generally liberate a mineral, further size reduction is usually required.

It also forms by alteration of other silver-bearing minerals. Much of the world's silver production is a by-product of refining lead, copper, and zinc. It is the second most malleable and ductile metal, and it is important in the photographic and electronic industries. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. It has long been valued as a precious metal.
