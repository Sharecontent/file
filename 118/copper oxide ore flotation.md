## What is Flotation in Oxide Copper Extraction? - Mining-pedia
May 30, 2022Amine flotation method, also known as cationic collector flotation method, is a commonly used flotation method for non-ferrous metal oxide ores (copper, lead, zinc). It is used in malachite, azurite and chalcopyrite, etc. Amine collectors are selective for oxide copper, because amines also have a capturing effect on many gangues.

## copper ore benfication
The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells, while the oxide ores are generally leached. First the copper ore from a open pit mine is blasted, loaded and transported to the primary crushers.  Today we introduce three commonly used copper ore beneficiation methods. 01 Copper ore flotation method Since many other metal substances are

## How to Process Copper Ore: Beneficiation Methods and Equipment
Jan 25, 2022Flotation is one of the commonly used mineral processing techniques for copper oxide ores. According to the different properties of copper oxide ores, there are sulphidizing flotation, fatty acid flotation, amine flotation, emulsion flotation and chelating agent-neutral oil flotation method. Flotation method of copper oxide ore 1.
