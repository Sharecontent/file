## Aggregate Crushing Value Login Information, Account|Loginask
The aggregate crushing value is a numerical index of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. It is expressed as the percentage by mass of the crushed (or finer) material obtained when the test sample is subjected to a specified load under standard conditions.

Aggregate Water Absorption Test. Water absorption gives an idea of strength of aggregate. Aggregates having more water absorption are more porous in nature and are generally considered unsuitable unless they are found to be acceptable based on strength, impact and hardness tests. Water absorption shall not be more than 2% per unit by weight.

## Aggregate Crushing Strength Test - Online CivilForum
The crushing strength or aggregate crushing value of a given road aggregate is found out as per IS-2386 Part- 4. The aggregate crushing value provides a relative measure of resistance to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load. To achieve a high quality of pavement aggregate possessing low aggregate crushing value should be preferred.
