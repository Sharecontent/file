## Exactly What Does Gold Ore Seem Like?
Jan 31, 2022Gold Ore is a mineral obtained mainly underground, though rare surface sightings are possible. It is less common than Iron, Silver, and Copper, and is normally found in formations of 5-30 blocks. Gold Ore is the strongest Ore to spawn on the surface layer. It is one tier below Demonite and one tier above Silver.

Gold Ore is a fairly rare ore found in Minecraft, typically found in veins of 1 to 9, from y=0 to y=31 in all biomes, and in veins of one to nine from y=28 to y=80 within a badlands biome. The ore itself is dropped when mined with an iron pickaxe or better. It has little use in tools and armor, since the durability is very low. Gold Ore can be smelted in a (blast) furnace to make gold ingots

In addition, submicroscopic (solid solution) gold, principally in arsenopyrite and pyrite, is also important. The main causes of refractory gold ores are submicroscopic gold, the Au-Ag tellurides, and very fine-grained gold (<10 µm) locked in sulfides. Other types of problem gold ores include copper-gold ores and preg-robbing carbonaceous ores.

Gold Ore is an early game ore which spawns in the Underground and Cavern layers. Its primary use is to make Gold Bars, which can be used to make the Gold tier of equipment, as well as crowns, Thrones, and several other items.
