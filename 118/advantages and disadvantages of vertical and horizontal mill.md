A CNC milling machine features a table that automatically moves (or rotates) the workpiece on different planes so the cutting tool can work on it. Unlike manual lathes, a CNC milling machine operates by converting a 3D CAD model into a set of computer instructions, which is then used to dictate the tooling's actions and movements automatically.
