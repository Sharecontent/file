According to researchers cement and sand can be replaced with quarry dust maximum upto 25 to 30%. To achieve cost effectiveness in construction, cement and sand should be replaced by more than 50% with quarry dust without affecting the concrete properties and experiments should be continued to achieve the same.

## Can quarry dust be replaced with sand in concrete?
Sand can be replaced by Quarry dust without any problem. Based on several references, I concluded that sand can be replaced by Quarry dust without highly compromising its durability property. By the experimental investigation, 40% replacement of sand with Quarry dust shows maximum compressive strength and later on, it will decrease after increasing percentage of Quarry Dust in the sand.

Granite fines or rock dust is a by-product obtained during crushing of granite rocks and is also called quarry dust. In recent days there were also been many attempts to use Fly Ash, an industrial by product as partial replacement for cement to have higher workability, long term strength and to make the concrete more economically available.

##  Effect of Fly Ash and Quarry Dust As a Partial Replacement of  - Ijlret
to study the effect of partial replacement of fine aggregates by quarry dust and cement by fly ash on cement concrete. 1.2 NEED FOR INVESTIGATION Quarry Dust These residues are generally less than 1% aggregate production in the normal concrete. The introduction of quarry dust for mixing is limited due to its high fineness.

## Can we make concrete using quarry dust as a replacement for sand 
As quarry dust (also called as crushed sand) is a byproduct obtained after crushing of stones (rocks) to make aggregates. Results have shown that the concrete made using crushed sand attains the compressive strength earlier as compared to the concrete made of natural sand. Practically the concrete made of crushed sand is more homogeneous as compared to natural (river)sand, because cr.sand,aggregate and cement gets easily mixed having similar properties.
