## Crusher
Mining operations use crushers, commonly classified by the degree to which they fragment the starting material, with primary and secondary crushers handling coarse materials, and tertiary and Quaternary crushers reducing ore particles to finer gradations. Each crusher is designed to work with a certain maximum size of raw material, and often

## Secondary Impact Crushers » MTM Crushing and Screening
Explanation. Machines used to crush materials less than mm in size are called secondary crushers. The aim of the secondary stage is having material size reduced to 0-60,0-40 or 0-35 mm. Secondary jaw or cone crushers should be selected for hard and abrasive materials to maintain optimum operating costs.

The simplest form of secondary crushing stage involves a single crusher, taking its feed by gravity flow direct from the primary with no interposed scalping separation. This is tantamount to making the over-all reduction in one machine, except of course that there will always be a certain amount of surge capacity between the two crushers.
