## The Complete Guide to Permeable Pavers and Paving Systems﻿
Permeable paving systems are porous, so they allow water to infiltrate the pavement and drain into the ground or sub-base rock underneath. These paving systems are just as strong and durable as traditional paving materials such as concrete, asphalt, or compacted gravel. Several types of porous paving grids exist, including plastic grid pavers

3) Make the Cut. Now it's time to cut. You need to use a different chisel for this stage - use a brick-set chisel, which has a longer blade, and a much wider head for hitting it hard. Hit your grooves hard and direct, and your concrete paver should easily come apart. If you're struggling, try repeating step 2 again.

Concrete pavers are cheaper in price than clay block paving. Block paving made from concrete are cheaper to buy than clay pavers. The saving can be as much as 50-100% cheaper to buy than buying like-for-like clay block paving. Installing a concrete block paved driveway is therefore cheaper than installing a patio or driveway using clay block

The sand - "concrete sand" is where the interlock takes place - it comes up and fills the joints causing them to lock up. Stone dust will only get hard "under" the pavers and actually hold water, which is another issue. Use concrete sand and only 3/4" under the pavers.

Concrete block paving offers outstanding strength and durability and is resistant to most chemicals. Blocks are routinely tested for parameters such as splitting strength and weathering, abrasion and slip/skid resistance, to ensure conformity with the requirements of BS EN 1338: 2003, Concrete Paving Blocks - Requirements and Test Methods.

## Sub-bases | Pavingexpert
The sub-base layer is often the main load-bearing layer of a pavement. It is designed to evenly spread the load of the paving, and any traffic thereon, to the sub-grade below. A well-constructed sub-base will aid drainage and prevent settlement and channelisation - the phenomenon common on cheap installations of block paving, where two 'ruts' develop in the paving.

The recommendation for over preparation is that the base material should extend past the paved edge an equal distance of the base depth. For example, if your patio is 20 feet by 10 feet and you are installing 6 inches of granular material as a base, then you must excavate an area 11 feet (10' + 6" + 6") by 21 feet (20' + 6" + 6").
