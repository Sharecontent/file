## Miner
A miner is a person who extracts ore, coal, chalk, clay, or other minerals from the earth through mining.There are two senses in which the term is used. In its narrowest sense, a miner is someone who works at the rock face; cutting, blasting, or otherwise working and removing the rock. In a broader sense, a "miner" is anyone working within a mine, not just a worker at the rock face.

There are a limited number of commercially available diamond mines currently operating in the world, with the 50 largest mines accounting for approximately 90% of global supply. Diamonds are also mined alluvially over disperse areas, where diamonds have been eroded out of the ground, deposited, and concentrated by water or weather action. There is also at least one example of a heritage

DIAMOND MINING PIPE MINING (PRIMARY DEPOSITS) There are two types of pipe mining, namely open-pit mining and underground mining. Open-pit mining involves removing the layers of sand and rock found just above the kimberlite. Once exposed, the ore in the pit is broken up by blasting. A single blast can break approx. 3,000 tonnes of ore.

Types of Diamonds - What You Need to Know. Technically speaking, there are 2 categories that are used to classify a diamond: type I (contains nitrogen impurities) and type II (without nitrogen impurities). Within these categories, they can be further broken down into 5 sub-categories: Type 1a, Type 1b, Type 1aB,Type 2a, and Type 2b.
