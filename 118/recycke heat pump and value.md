## Upping the value of heat pumps | Smart Infrastructure Magazine
This event follows hard on the heels of the UK Government's recent decision to offer UK households grants worth £5,000 to install heat pumps. The moves form part of the Government's heat and buildings strategy and wider plans to cut UK climate emissions to net zero by 2050. In the UK, Glen Dimplex Heating & Ventilation is currently

## Heat Pump Repair Basics: The Reversing Valve - AC Designs Inc.
The reversing valve is a somewhat delicate component that has a pipe on the bottom and three on the top. The job of the reversing valve is to change the direction of the flow of refrigerant in your system; this is how the heat pump changes modes between heating and cooling. The valve has two settings within it: one is excited, the other is relaxed.

Rheem's RP20 seer variable speed compressor allows for a 40%-100% range of output. This technology can deliver up to a 60% reduction in electric bills over a standard heat pump, which makes the RP20 an investment rather than a purchase. Most homeowners can recoup the initial purchase price in as little as 6-8 years!

## Understanding COP: Coefficient Of Performance Of Heat Pumps - LearnMetrics
T cold is the cold temperature at which the heat pump starts to operate (57F or 287K). Theoretical maximum COP is calculated like this: COP heat pump = 308K/ (308K-287K) = 14,67. So, in theory, a heat pump can have a COP even above 10. Nonetheless, the real COP of a heat pump in practice is a lot lower.

Today's heat pump can reduce your electricity use for heating by approximately 50% compared to electric resistance heating such as furnaces and baseboard heaters. High-efficiency heat pumps also dehumidify better than standard central air conditioners, resulting in less energy usage and more cooling comfort in summer months.

## How Efficient Are Heat Pumps, Really? - Fine Homebuilding
A furnace or boiler that burns fossil fuel (natural gas, propane, or heating oil) will have an efficiency that ranges from about 78% to 98%. In the case of a heat pump, the fuel is electricity. A toaster or electric baseboard heat has an efficiency of 100%. A heat pump has a higher efficiency— usually in the range of 200% to 300%, although

## What is the old unit worth in scrap? - HVAC-Talk: Heating, Air 
What is an 18 year old heat pump and air handler worth to metal recyclers?  Get the indoor blower out, if it works it's probably worth more than it's scrap metal value. People like to use them as shop fans. Condenser fan/motor may be worth something also., 08:12 AM #6. motoguy128.
