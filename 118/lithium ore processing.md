8.03%. Due to its high lithium content, spodumene is considered the most important lithium ore mineral. A typical run of mine ore can contain 1-2% Li 2 O, while a typical spodumene concentrate suitable for lithium carbonate production contains 6-7% Li 2 O (75% - 87% spodumene). Higher grade concentrates with 7.6% Li 2 O and low iron content are
