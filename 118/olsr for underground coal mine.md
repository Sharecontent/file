CiteSeerX - Document Details (Isaac Councill, Lee Giles, Pradeep Teregowda): Abstract—There is a growing interest in using wireless sensor networks for security monitoring in the underground coal mines. In such applications, the sensor nodes are deployed to detect interested events, e.g., the density of certain gas at some locations is higher than the predefined threshold.
