## 4 Types of Air Compressors (Comparison & Application) | Linquip
In single-acting reciprocating compressors, the piston compresses the air only on one side of it, while in double-acting reciprocating compressors the piston would compress the air on both of its sides. This design allows for higher horsepower sizes of as high as 1000 HP in the double-acting design.

First it is important to know how the capacity of an air compressor is measured. 1. Volume of Compressed Air Flow upon a particular given time. This means how much volume of compressed air can be generated by an air compressor when it has run for a particular amount of time. This unit is exactly measured as volume of air upon time.

## What is the hourly fuel consumption of a 250 cfm compressor  - Answers
250 euros into dollars is $305.74. This is because the ratio of euros to dollars currently is 1:1.22. So 250 multiply by 1.22 = to $305.74. This does vary hourly as the conversion will vary.

## Understanding Air Compressor Ratings - Campbell Hausfeld
This number is used as a measure of the compressor's capabilities. Compressors with higher cfm ratings provide more air, which makes them more practical for larger jobs. PSI: Pounds per square inch is the measure of air force delivered by the air compressors. The vast majority of air tools require psi of 40 or 90 to get the job done.

## Air Compressors for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Systems
Air Compressors are used to push air into the fuel cell stack. The fuel cell extracts oxygen from the incoming air to enable the reaction at the cathode. In fuel cell systems, the air compressor is also sometimes called an air blower. The performance of a fuel cell system depends significantly on the amount of air available.
