The outstanding advantage of the gyratory crusher is that the crushing wall is large, which can reach -9.5, and sometimes it can be as high as 13.5. The production efficiency is high, and the work is relatively stable. Either side can feed ore and can be crowded with ore. The particle size of the crushed product is uniform.

The gyratory crushers are equipped with a hydraulic setting adjustment system, which adjusts c.s.s. and thus af ects product gradation. Depending on cone type, setting can be ad- justed in two ways. The i rst way is for setting adjustment to be done by rotating the bowl against the threads so that the vertical position of the outer wear part (concave) is changed.

Essentially, the gyratory crusher consists of a heavy cast-iron, or steel, frame which includes in its lower part an actuating mechanism (eccentric and driving gears), and in its upper part a cone-shaped crushing chamber, lined with wear-resisting plates (concaves). Spanning the crushing chamber across its top is a steady-rest (spider), containing a machined journal which fixes the position of the upper end of the main shaft.
