## Blasting-crushing-grinding: Optimisation of an - Taylor & Francis
The paper describes and presents the results of several industrial and laboratory blasting, crushing, and grinding tests and experiments investigating how blasting can influence the subsequent crushing and grinding operations. The paper will also discuss how these results can aid in evaluation of the whole comminution system.

## blasting | Britannica
blasting, process of reducing a solid body, such as rock, to fragments by using an explosive. Conventional blasting operations include (1) drilling holes, (2) placing a charge and detonator in each hole, (3) detonating the charge, and (4) clearing away the broken material. Upon detonation, the chemical energy in the explosive is liberated, and the compact explosive becomes transformed into a

This technique is feasible for measuring the crusher product and mill feed but is very expensive and time consuming for measuring ROM.

## MINERAL PROCESSING: Optimization starts with blasting and crushing
Blast design changes were modelled and the predicted run-of-mine fragmentation 'fed' to the grinding circuit model during a number of simulations to achieve different increases in mill throughput. The blast patterns were designed to increase the amount of ultra fines generated during blasting that cannot be created through conventional crushing.

Dec 17, 2020Blasting parameters are usually optimized to control blasting fragmentation to meet the gradation requirements of mining. However, blasting in the ventilation shaft is different from those in mines. For example, no grading requirement, no cutting hole, and no bench height are provided for the ventilation shaft blasting.

and blasting parameters. Rock fragmentation depends upon two groups of variables: rock mass properties which cannot be controlled and drill-and-blast design parameters that can be controlled and optimized. The costs of downstream operations can be reduced by optimizing the blast design parameters to provide target fragmentation. The parameters of target fragmen-
