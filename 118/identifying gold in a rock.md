Acid Test: This is a simple test that capitalizes on the reaction of gold with acid to prove its originality. All you have to do is make a slight scratch on the surface and add a small drop of trioxo nitrate (v) acid (HNO3). If the gold does not react with the acid, this is a proof that we're dealing with real gold.
