## Energy efficiency • Energy intensity in copper and gold mining
In 2015, the average copper grade in the ores was only 0.65 %. For the year 2026, it is expected that the ores in Chile will have copper grades of less than 0.5 %. This will naturally increase the amount of run-of-mine ore that has to be processed. In international comparison, the Chilean copper ore mining industry is steadily deteriorating.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing. Mined from open pits, copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production. Using today's compact mining equipment, copper ore is extracted from the mine. After the ore is crushed, it's roasted, which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.

## Copper extraction
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes. Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source, local environmental regulations, and other factors.. As in all mining operations, the ore must usually be beneficiated (concentrated).

Ores Sulfides. Canadian ores are sulfides containing nickel, copper, and iron. The most important nickel mineral is pentlandite, (Ni, Fe) 9 S 8, followed by pyrrhotite, usually ranging from FeS to Fe 7 S 8, in which some of the iron may be replaced by nickel. Chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, is the dominant copper mineral in these ores, with small amounts of another copper mineral, cubanite, CuFe 2 S 3.
