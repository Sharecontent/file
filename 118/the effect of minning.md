## The Environmental Impact Of Diamond Mining | Jaume Labro
So while there is less associated environmental harm, there are still serious short- and long-term risks with the four diamond mining processes: 1. Open Pit Mining. Layers of earth and rock are first removed and the ore beneath is blasted to allow for removal. The rough material is loaded onto trucks and transported to an industrial crusher.

## The Effects of the Ethereum Merge on GPU Prices
A key component to determining how effective a particular GPU is for mining is the hash rate. The cryptocurrency hash rate measures a GPU's computing power, which is a critical security indicator. As GPUs became even more powerful over time, hash rates increased, leading to modern gaming graphics cards being highly lucrative to use for mining.

## News at a glance: Immunotherapy for lupus, near-instant health effects 
Racism's effects in real time.  Just four countries accounted for 81% of tropical forest loss caused by industrial mining as of 2019, according to a study published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The largest contributor, Indonesia, digs mainly coal, whereas others mine gold and aluminum ore.

Lab 4 - Energy Sources and Alternative Energy Experiment 1: The Effects of Coal Mining Coal mining, particularly surface mining, leads to large areas of land being temporarily disturbed. Mines collect and conduct water that is in contact with pyrite, a mineral that produces iron and sulfuric acid when exposed to air and water. Limestone is often used to mitigate the effects of pyrite on water.
