Plant uptake of soil nitrogen. Plants require more nitrogen (N) than any other nutrient but only a small portion of the nitrogen in soil is available to plants; 98 % of the nitrogen in soil is in organic forms. Most forms of organic nitrogen cannot be taken up by plants, with the exception of some small organic molecules.

Rates of fertilization are often given in parts per million (ppm) of nitrogen (N), which is a way of expressing fertilizer concentration.

Plant species specific nitrogen uptake. When ammonium levels are higher, sugars need to be transported down from the leaves to the roots to metabolize the ammonium.  An increase of the proton concentration around the roots decreases the pH around the roots (more acidic). Similarly, when the plant takes up Nitrate (NO3-) it releases

In addition, studies on intact plants show strong evidence for a general decrease in the specific uptake rates (uptake per unit mass or length of root) of N by roots under elevated CO2. This decreased root uptake appears likely to be the result both of decreased N demand by shoots and of decreased ability of the soil-root system to supply N.

## A novel insight into nitrogen and auxin signaling in lateral root 
Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. In tea, lateral roots (LRs) are the main organ responsible for the absorption of moisture and mineral nutrients from the soil. Lateral roots formation and development are regulated by the nitrogen and auxin signaling pathways. In order to understand the role of auxin and nitrogen signaling in LRs
