## Granite Crushed Rock Bulk Density
This range of densities can also be attributed to a rock s porosity (the amount of open space between mineral grains). This is measured either as a decimal between 0 and 1 or as a percentage. In crystalline rocks like granite which have tight interlocking mineral grains porosity is normally quite low (less than 1 percent).

## Evaluation of a new grain breakage factor based on the single grain 
The single grain crushing strength of the calcerous origin soil sample's mean grain-sized grains was determined to be 12.7 MPa, and this value was determined to be 25.6 MPa for the sample consisting of basalt origin grains.  The absorption value should not exceed 1.0 for granite, traprock, and quartzite, but 2.0 for limestone . The sub
