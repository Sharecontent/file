##  Experimental Study on Strength of Cement Mortar Using Shale As Fine 
2.3 Crushed Shale (CS) Shale is a fine-grained sedimentary rock that is formed from the compaction of silt and clay-size mineral particles which is commonly called as mud. This composition places shale in a category of sedimentary rocks known as mudstones. It is distinguished from other mudstones because it is fissile and laminated.

So really, the final driveway won't be shale on top, but millings or runner crush. 6-8" of recycled would be almost $6000 in my area, plus $1000 to install. The escavator can lay down almost 12" of shale for about $3000. In the spring, it would cost me another $2000 or so to finish off with runner crush including labor.

## Restoring Limestone, Removing Mildew and Mold
For interior limestone, it may be necessary to dry limestone. Use a heat gun and gently dry the tiles. Check the moisture periodically by using a damp meter, and stop applying heat once the stone is dry all the way through. This is less necessary for exterior limestone, though cleaning should be saved for a warm and sunny day for proper drying.
