## Ultrasound after mammogram dense breasts
Ultrasound imaging (also called sonography) uses sound waves that the human ear cannot hear to image the breast. It has been in widespread use for more than 40 years. The sound waves are transmitted by a handheld device known as a transducer, which sends brief sound waves into the body. As these waves reflect back from the internal tissues, the.

## Crushing of kidney stones with ultrasound and laser
The procedure for crushing stones in the kidneys is carried out with a holmium laser. Due to the action of a thin beam of concentrated light, moisture evaporates from the formation. Point effect allows to avoid damage to soft tissues. In addition, the maximum penetration depth of the laser is 0.5 millimeters.
