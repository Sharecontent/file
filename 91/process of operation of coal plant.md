## How a Coke Plant Works - GASP
How a Coke Plant Works. Coal is the main ingredient used to make coke. Iron is produced by inputting coal into a blast furnace. However, coal cannot be put directly into a blast furnace because of all the harmful by-products that come from that. So, there is an intermediate process that occurs. Coal is converted into coke first.
