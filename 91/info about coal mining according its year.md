The environmental aspects of mining have received little analysis. U.S. coals vary in moisture content (2 to 40%), sulfur content (0.2 to 8%) and ash content (5 to 40%). The energy content varies from lignite to sub-bituminous to bituminous coal. The ORNL-RFF study looks at two levels of sulfur content (0.7% and 2.1%).
