At Lonestar Minerals we use sodium bentonite to fix ponds and lakes simply because it makes sense. Bentonite as a mineral is a low cost material, 100% natural, with a very high effectiveness for reducing water seepage and sealing any leaks. The investment for fixing a pond with bentonite pond sealant is comparable to other sealants.

## Bentonite: Applications With Coal as Bentonite-Clay - African Pegmatite
Summary. Bentonite is a type of clay that is prized for its porosity, workability and non-toxic nature. In foundry applications, it is used with coal (bentonite-coal) in sand/green sand molding for metal castings; where it enhances the refractory properties of the mold whilst also increasing strength and flowability.

1 Introduction. Bentonite is a geological term for soil materials with a high content of a swelling mineral, which usually is montmorillonite. It is produced by in situ devitrifications of volcanic ash [].Although, bentonite chemical composition varies from one place to another place [].The bentonite clay is often extracted from open pit mines with different deposit depths and many impurities.

## Bentonite
Wyoming's Bentonite industry produced over 4.0 million tons of bentonite in 1999, with 644 mine and mill employees, and 240 contractor employees. Wyoming bentonite is composed essentially of montmorillonite clay, also known as hydrous silicate of alumina. In more simplistic terms, the structure of bentonite is much like a sandwiched deck of cards.
