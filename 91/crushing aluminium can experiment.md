However, zinc phosphide was specifically excluded from this grouping because it reacts with stomach acid rather than water (Rubin 2014) and because its use patterns are significantly different from the fumigation uses of phosphine gas (US EPA 2009b). Aluminum phosphide and magnesium phosphide were first registered in the U.S. in 1958 and.

Watch The Can Collapse Before Your Eyes. An Aluminum can is crushed using only air pressure! When the can is heated, the water inside boils and escapes. When the can is put in the cold water, a partial vacuum is created, crushing the can. The collapsing can demonstrates that things contract, or get smaller, when they get cold.

Take a tin-can having an airtight cap (screw cap). Remove cap and boil some water in it, so that steam comes out and in this way air from inside goes out. While boiling replace the cap and allow it to cool. Vapours inside condense and form water creating a vacuum above them. We see the can crumbles due to air pressure from outside.
