## Furnace cement powdern-rauch
Cement is a commonly used binding material in the construction. The cement is obtained by burning a mixture of calcarious (calcium) and argillaceous (clay) material at a very high temperature and then grinding the clinker so produced to a fine powder.It was first produced by a mason Joseph Aspdin in England in 1924. Bulk storage silos made of steel are the perfect solution to store the

Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.

Abstract. Marble powder has been identified as a low costing material with the potential to redress the problem. The specimen has been prepared and tested for the strength with partial replacement of marble powder and cement in concrete The Compressive strength, Split Tensile strength, Flexural strength and Modulus of elasticity of Concrete can

## Experimental Study on Partial Replacement of Cement With Glass Powder 
The current study involves the partial replacement of cement (varying proportion) with marble powder (4, 8%, 12% and 16%) and glass powder (4, 8%, 12% and 16%) to generate sustainable concrete. The Slump Test, Compressive Strength Test, Split Tensile Strength Test and Flexural Strength Test were carried out and the results were collected.
