Aggregate Production: Fines Generation During Rock Crushing. Jan 01, 2007 Abstract. The energy required to crush rocks is proportional to the amount of new surface area that is created hence, a very important percentage of the energy consumed to produce construction aggregates is spent in producing non-commercial fines.

## Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock
The generation of fines increases when shear is imposed during crushing. Aggregates produced in current crushing operations show the effects of multiple loading conditions and fracture modes. Results support the producers' empirical observations that the desired cubicity of aggregates is obtained at the expense of increased fines generation

## Mining Crushing Fines Amount
Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock crushing. In choked operations, high inter-particle coordination controls particle-level loading conditions, causes micro-fractures on new aggregate faces and generates a large amount of fines. The generation of fines increases when shear is imposed during crushing.
