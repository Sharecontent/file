## Iron
Iron (/ ˈ aɪ ər n /) is a chemical element with symbol Fe (from Latin: ferrum) and atomic number 26. It is a metal that belongs to the first transition series and group 8 of the periodic table.It is, by mass, the most common element on Earth, right in front of oxygen (32.1% and 30.1%, respectively), forming much of Earth's outer and inner core.It is the fourth most common element in the

Abstract. Iron ores of the Kiruna type are unusual formations restricted both in time and space. They are principally found in the Precambrian of Sweden and Missouri. The purpose of the present paper is to summarize the features that characterize the ores and to discuss their origin. It is concluded that the ores are intrusive-magmatic.

##  Iron Ore Pellet Characterization Through
Iron ore pellets are widely employed in blast furnaces to produce pig iron. Because pellets are used in large proportion, which is still rising due to the lack of supply of high quality lump ores, there is an increasing interest to research and to improve the properties of iron ore pellets.(1)

## Characterization of iron ore by visible and infrared reflectance and 
Reflectance and Raman spectroscopies are powerful techniques for the mineralogical characterization of iron ores. Reflectance spectroscopy in the visible ( nm) and infrared (750-14,000 nm) parts of the electromagnetic spectrum provides mineralogical and compositional data on iron ore minerals, such as hematite and goethite, as well as gangue minerals, such as carbonates, silicates

## What is Iron Ore? - WorldAtlas
Iron ore refers to rocks or minerals from which metallic iron is extracted for commercial use. These minerals appear dark grey to rusty red in color, and are usually rich in iron oxides. Iron occurs in these ores in the form of such chemical compounds as hematite, magnetite, siderite, limonite, or geothite. Even though iron is the fourth most
