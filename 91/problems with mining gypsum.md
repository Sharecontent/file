Gypsum is a crafting item mined from gypsum ore. Gypsum can be mined by a player or a miner from: Gypsum Ore Mining the ore once yields 5 gypsum. The miner can extract an infinite amount of gypsum from one gypsum ore, whereas the player can obtain a maximum of 5 gypsum from one gypsum ore. Gypsum is required to craft the following blocks and items (this list is non exhaustive): Grey Planks

## Gypsum Dreams - Wild About Utah
Gypsum Dreams. Gypsum is a pale, soft mineral composed of hydrous calcium sulfate. Both gypsum and rock salt, or halite, are geologically peculiar. Pressed under the weight of overlying rock strata, they become plastic and mobile. Gypsum and halite are light compared to other rock layers and so are squeezed upward to form massive salt domes.

## The Many Uses & Some Misuses of Gypsum in Vineyards.
Gypsum is a versatile soil amendment, having many uses for both conventional and organic wine grape vineyards (Figure 1). It is also the soil amendment most likely to be misused. Gypsum is calcium sulfate (mostly calcium sulfate dihydrate or CaSO 4 •2H 2 O). Technically, calcium sulfate is a moderately soluble salt.
