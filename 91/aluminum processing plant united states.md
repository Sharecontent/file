Aluminum has been used in the aerospace industry from the beginning. It was also a vital part of America's effort in World War 2. Most of America's fighter planes were made of this lightweight, cheap, and corrosion resistant material. Aluminum's corrosion resistance and strength-to-weight ratio make it ideal for aircraft manufacturing.

Bauxite is then converted into aluminum oxide, or alumina, using natural gas at plants located in the southern United States. After alumina is extracted from bauxite ore, further processing called 'smelting' is necessary to convert it into aluminum.

Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth's surface. Only oxygen and silicon are more common. Earth's crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum. Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form. Its compounds, however, are an important constituent of virtually all common rocks.
