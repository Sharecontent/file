## Coal tip safety | GOV.WALES
Coal tip safety is devolved to Wales. The law relating to coal tips is The Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969. This dates from when there was an active coal industry. The legislation is not effective at managing the safety of disused coal tips in a holistic way. Reform is needed to reduce the risk of dangerous incidents occurring.

## Coal Mines in the Industrial Revolution - History Learning Site
Before the Industrial Revolution, two types of mines existed: drift mines and bell pits. Both were small-scale coal mines and the coal which came from these type of pits was used locally in homes and local industry. However, as the country started to industrialise itself, more and more coal was needed to fuel steam engines and furnaces.

## Coal
Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock, formed as rock strata called coal seams.Coal is mostly carbon with variable amounts of other elements, chiefly hydrogen, sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. Coal is formed when dead plant matter decays into peat and is converted into coal by the heat and pressure of deep burial over millions of years.

Longwall mining involves underground coal mining, whereby a long wall of coal is mined via a single slice, and the slice is usually from two feet to a little over three feet thick. The block of coal being mined, which is called the longwall panel, is normally approximately 270 to 430 yards in width and two to three miles in length.

Coal Mining. Types of Coal Mines. There are four main types of coal mines: shaft mine, slope mine, drift mine, and surface (open-cast) mine. The mine at Coalwood was a shaft mine; the coal was brought up in an elevator from 600 to 800 feet underground. The University of Kentucky has an interesting diagram showing each of the four types of mining.

Conventional mining is the oldest method and accounts for only about 12% of underground coal output. In conventional mining, the coal seam is cut, drilled, blasted and then loaded into cars. Continuous mining is the most prevalent form of underground mining, accounting for 56% of total underground production.

This is because the deeper levels are older and have been squashed more, leaving higher concentrations of a substance called carbon which means that the coal gives off more heat when it is burned.
