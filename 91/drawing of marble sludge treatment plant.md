## How Does Activated Sludge Wastewater Treatment Work? | AOS
The activated sludge process in the treatment of wastewater involves blowing oxygen or air into raw, unsettled sewage. This process smashes the solids. The sewage is bubbled, and sewage liquor is discharged into an activated sludge chamber. Live bacteria settle to the bottom of the tank and dead bacteria float to the top.

##  Technical and Commercial Proposal for Aerobic Sludge Digestor Treatment 
A sludge drying bed provides a low-tech and economic solution for sludge dewatering. The excess sludge is periodically drained form the aerobic sludge digester and spread over the drying bed. The water passes though the sand bed leaving behind the sludge. The sludge left behind is then left to dry and then raked from the sand surface.
