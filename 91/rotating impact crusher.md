I would say that in general, yeah, there's definitely some maintenance involved with crushing. Typically we're looking at the wear parts or the actual parts of the crusher that are impacted by the material. So if it's an impact crusher it would be the blow bars. If it's a jaw crusher it's the jaw dies or jaw plates.
