## Environmental Risks of Mining - Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Environmental hazards are present during every step of the open-pit mining process. Hardrock mining exposes rock that has lain unexposed for geological eras. When crushed, these rocks expose radioactive elements, asbestos-like minerals, and metallic dust. During separation, residual rock slurries, which are mixtures of pulverized rock and

## Molybdenum mining in the United States
Molybdenum mines. Molybdenum mining in the United States produced 65,500 metric tons of molybdenum in 2014, worth US$1.8 billion.
