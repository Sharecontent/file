Climate change and the cement industry: A baseline. The cement industry alone is responsible for about a quarter of all industry CO 2 emissions, and it also generates the most CO 2 emissions per dollar of revenue (Exhibit 1). About two-thirds of those total emissions result from calcination, the chemical reaction that occurs when raw materials such as limestone are exposed to high temperatures.

The limestone acts as a seed crystal for the cement, better distributing the reaction products and increasing the reactivity of the cement. As there is always unhydrated cement in the concrete, this change will have no real measurable effect on the use of fly ash.
