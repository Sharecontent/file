## How Copper Is Mined - Realonomics
The laborious task of mining copper ore by hand made it difficult to obtain large quantities for production. During the Industrial Revolution coal- and steam-powered machinery paved the way for a huge increase in copper production with mines smelting between 200 and 300 tons of copper ore per week. How is copper made naturally?

Once the ore is removed from the ground, it goes through processing in order to remove the other products, using elements such as oxygen, iron, silica and sulfuric acid. Copper is usually found in pit mining operations. Copper is generally close to the surface, so most copper mines use open pit techniques to remove the copper from the ground.

Deforestation & Land Degradation. Depending on where the ore is located, copper mining can severely damage the environment through deforestation. To pursue an open-pit mining operation, copper miners must remove trees and dig a pit to access it. Open-pit mines are massive. They can be nearly a mile in diameter and several thousand feet deep.

Copper (Cu) is an extremely useful industrial metal that is ductile (capable of being drawn into wire), malleable (capable of being hammered and molded) and an excellent conductor of electricity (only silver is better). Copper is found in many minerals which occur in deposits large enough to mine. These include: azurite, malachite, chalcocite

Copper is usually found in nature in association with sulfur. Pure copper metal is generally produced from a multistage process, beginning with the mining and concentrating of low-grade ores containing copper sulfide minerals, and followed by smelting and electrolytic refining to produce a pure copper cathode.

The flotation process gets rid of impurities in the ore, where there may also be lead and other vital metals in our society such as
