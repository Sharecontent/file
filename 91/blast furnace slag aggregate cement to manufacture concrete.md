## What Is Blast Furnace Slag Cement? Is It Good To Use? - DreamLandEstate
Mar 30, 2022Slag cement comes in such a finely grounded form that it reduces the level of permeability while increasing its durability. Since slag cement experiences low levels of heat hydration because it's an exothermic process, it is extensively used for structures where thermal cracking can be predicted. Since the Blast Furnace Slag Cement is white

## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.
