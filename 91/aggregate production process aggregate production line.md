## What directly results from disaggregation of an aggregate plan?
What is forecasting and aggregate planning? Aggregate Planning by definition is concerned with determining the quantity and scheduling of production for the mid-term future. The timing on an aggregate plan runs normally from 3 to 18 months. Therefore, the plan is a by-product of the longer term strategic plan.

## Aggregate Production Function - Meaning, Factors, Formula, Graph
The Aggregate Production Function is the function that shows a technical relationship between aggregate inputs and aggregate outputs. It is a mathematical model that economists use to illustrate the change in productivity because of the changes in factors of production. It helps an economy to produce its potential level of output.
