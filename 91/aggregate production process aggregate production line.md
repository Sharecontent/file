## What directly results from disaggregation of an aggregate plan?
What is forecasting and aggregate planning? Aggregate Planning by definition is concerned with determining the quantity and scheduling of production for the mid-term future. The timing on an aggregate plan runs normally from 3 to 18 months. Therefore, the plan is a by-product of the longer term strategic plan.

## Aggregate Production Processing Plant, Equipment - JXSC Rock Crusher
The aggregate production process mainly includes coarse crushing, fine crushing, screening and conveying. With the rapid development of the construction industry, the demand for manufactured sand, crushed stone, and other aggregate are growing. Aggregate crushing equipmen t has also become a hot large-scale machine on the market.

## Aggregate Production Function - Meaning, Factors, Formula, Graph
The Aggregate Production Function is the function that shows a technical relationship between aggregate inputs and aggregate outputs. It is a mathematical model that economists use to illustrate the change in productivity because of the changes in factors of production. It helps an economy to produce its potential level of output.
