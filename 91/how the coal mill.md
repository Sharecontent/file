## CFD modeling of MPS coal mill with moisture evaporation
Coal pulverizers play an important role in the functioning and performance of a PC-fired boiler. The main functions of a pulverizer are crushing, drying and separating the fine coal particles toward combustion in the furnace. It is a common experience that mill outlet pipes have unequal coal flow in each pipe and contain some coarse particles.

To summarize the coal mill controls, they may be divided basically into two major categories:. 1. To control the quality of coal being sent to the burners located on the furnace walls. The word quality here means the temperature and fineness of the PF. The set temperature values are dependent on the percentage of volatile matter that exists in the main fuel.

## Raw Coal Spillage Or "Pyriting"
Coal dribble or spillage is raw coal that is rejected through the pulverizer's pyrite discharge. This is caused when the velocity across the pulverizer throat is too low to maintain suspension of coal. Air velocities through the pulverizer throat should be 7,000 to 7,500 Fpm when calculated on a free jet basis.

What are coal feeders? Coal Feeder is a device that regulates the amount of coal to be supplied into the Coal Mill. The amount of coal is regulated according to the needs in the boiler combustion chamber (furnace).. The number regulation system in the coal feeder can be done in two ways based on the type, namely by weight fraction or coal volume fraction.

## Coal Mill Safety
VG: At best, coal mill safety is not well understood and, at worst, it is ignored. When it comes to coal mill systems, most cement plant operators just presume that the supplier of the equipment knows all of the standards and rules and is 100% capable of making a system that conforms to these and is therefore safe. However, this is not the case.
