## Calcination of Limestone - IspatGuru
Some limestone, due to its crystalline structure, disintegrates during the calcination process. This type of limestone is not useful for calcining. There is some other limestone whose behaviour is the opposite.  It has relatively high construction cost due to its conception. Fig 5 Annular shaft kiln. Other types shaft kilns.

## Avoiding limestone staining at grade - Construction Specifier
Sources of alkali in new construction include poured-in-place concrete, newly placed concrete block, or other cementitious construction materials such as mortar.  The process by which alkali staining of limestone occurs is similar to that of efflorescence, although in the latter, moisture transmits minerals such as sodium sulfate and calcium

## Limestone, scaling, fouling in water - Vesi Process
Limestone, scaling, fouling in water. The color of the limestone depends on the other sediments in the mixture besides the mineral calcite, which is white; impurities such as sand, clay, and organic material are also present in limestone and affect the color. Sulfates contained in the water come from the dissolution of gypsum.

Limestone is a very strong construction material that can be used both indoors and outdoors. Since it is resistant to almost all kinds of weather, it provides the same looks and sturdiness for years to come. Although Limestone is one of the most popular choices for architects to create great designs, not many people know where it can be used.
