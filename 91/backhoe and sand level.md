## What is a BACKHOE? Backhoe crane - Functions of backhoe
The backhoe is the main tool of the backhoe loader. It's used to dig up hard, compact material, usually earth, or to lift heavy loads, such as a sewer box. It can lift this material and drop it in a pile to the side of the hole. Basically, the backhoe is a big, extremely powerful version of your arm or finger.

Backhoe: Excavator: Rotation: The rotation ranges of backhoes and excavators differ, making them extremely special equipment from an operator's perspective. The arm of a backhoe can only pivot roughly 200 degrees. An excavator operator can spin the whole machine's chassis and arm in a complete circle of 360 degrees.

As mentioned above, the best sand for lawn leveling is one that has a fine grit. Two of the most common fine grit sands are mason sand and play sand. These are sands that have been carefully sifted to remove larger pieces of sand and gravel. They both have really small grains and will do a good job spreading evenly.
