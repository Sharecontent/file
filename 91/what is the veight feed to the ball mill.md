Ball Mill - an overview ScienceDirect Topics. The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media. The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1-1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry, with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating, or slurry containing 20-40% water by weight.

## Ball Mill: Operating principles, components, Uses, Advantages and
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis. The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 - 50 % of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.
