Rotary screw air compressors used on service trucks and vans are oil-injected, which means oil is used to lubricate and seal the rotors in the air end, and helps to cool the air compressor.This allows the rotors to create high pressures quite quickly and compress air in a single stage. The oil then gets separated out from the air before the. G7 Atlas Copco Oil Injected Rotary Screw Air
