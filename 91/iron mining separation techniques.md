Six steps to process iron ore. 1. Screening. We recommend that you begin by screening the iron ore to separate fine particles below the crusher's CSS before the crushing stage. A static screen is used to divert the fine particles for crushing. This step prevents overloading the crusher and increases its efficiency.

## Extraction of Iron: Meaning, Purification, & Extraction Methods
The extraction of iron from its ore is the third and the penultimate process in metallurgy, which is the process of separating metals from their ores. The common ores of iron are iron oxides. These oxides can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke. Heating coal in the absence of air produces coke.

## Magnetic Separation - Mining Fundamentals
Iron ores are usually subjected to the magnetic separation process, due to the high magnetic susceptibility of iron. Magnetic separation was first applied to the separation of wolframite from cassiterite. The first magnetic separator, invented by John Prince, consisted of two pairs of electromagnets with a feed belt running over them.

Mineral processing Wikipedia. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite, such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores.

Hydrometallurgy. Metallurgy consists of three general steps: (1) mining the ore, (2) separating and concentrating the metal or the metal-containing compound, and (3) reducing the ore to the metal. Additional processes are sometimes required to improve the mechanical properties of the metal or increase its purity.
