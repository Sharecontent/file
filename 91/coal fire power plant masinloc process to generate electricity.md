## Coal-fired power generation | Sulzer
Coal- and oil-fired process. Coal- and oil-fired steam power plants have steam turbines to convert the heat energy of combustion into mechanical energy, which then operates an electric generator. All plants use the steam turbine for the drop between the high pressure and temperature of the steam and the lower pressure of condensing vapor.

In 1995, Coal burning produced about 55% of the electricity generated in the U.S. In addition, know coal reserves are expected to last for centuries at current rates of usage. Coal power is a rather simple process. In most coal fired power plants, chunks of coal are crushed into fine powder and are fed into a combustion unit where it is burned.

## Electricity in the U.S. - Energy Information Administration
Biomass was the source of about 1.3% of total U.S. electricity generation and about 6.7% of electricity generation from renewable energy in 2021. Biomass is burned directly in steam-electric power plants, or it can be converted to a gas that can be burned in steam generators, gas turbines, or internal combustion engine generators.

Coal-fired power plants are the primary sources of coal FAs in the United States. According to the US Energy Information Administration, approximately 24% of the electricity generated in the United States relies on coal-burning (Fig. 23.1).As of 2018, the generation of coal FA in the United States was over 36 million tons, and 20 million tons of it were recycled (ACAA, 2019).

## How does coal generate electricity? | National Grid ESO
The principle of how coal generates electricity is fundamentally the same as in Edison's day, and similar to other thermal power stations like gas : the coal is burned, heating water to create steam, which spins a turbine to produce electricity. Throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this is how much of Britain's power was

## How Fossil Fuels are Used to Generate Electricity
Similar to the process with coal, the power plants burn natural gas to boil water to produce steam. The steam spins the blades of a turbine that are connected to a generator. The generator then spins magnets to generate electricity. The electricity then passes through power plants (EPSC, 2017).

Coal is an important source of energy in the United States, and the Nation's reliance on this fossil fuel for electricity generation is growing. The combustion of coal, however, adds a significant amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere per unit of heat energy, more than does the combustion of other fossil fuels.
