## What is coal used for? | U.S. Geological Survey
Coal is primarily used as fuel to generate electric power in the United States. In coal-fired power plants, bituminous coal, subbituminous coal, or lignite is burned. The heat produced by the combustion of the coal is used to convert water into high-pressure steam, which drives a turbine, which produces electricity. In 2019, about 23 percent of all electricity in the United States was

There are four different types of coal: Anthracite - contains between 86% and 98% carbon by weight and it burns in boilers slowly. Bituminous - contains between 69% & 86% carbon by weight. Sub-bituminous - contains less carbon, more water and is a less efficient source of heat for boilers. Lignite - contains up to 70% water by weight.
