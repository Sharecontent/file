Introduction. Sand and gravel are used extensively in construction. In the preparation of concrete, for each tonne of cement, the building industry needs about six to seven times more tonnes of sand and gravel (USGS, 2013b). Thus, the world's use of aggregates for concrete can be estimated at 25.9 billion to 29.6 billion tonnes a year for 2012 alone.
