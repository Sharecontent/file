## What Is Recycled Concrete Aggregate? | Process of Recycled concrete 
The main factor affecting the density of recycled concrete aggregate is the aggregate residue on the aggregate. Recycled concrete aggregates get less than with natural aggregate density. According to a study by Limbachiya et al, the relative density of recycled concrete aggregate (saturated surface in the dry state) is about 7-9% lower than

## RECYCLED CONCRETE AGGREGATES - Fibo Intercon
Cost to produce recycled concrete aggregate range from £5 to £12 per tonne. The cost depends on the quantity, the quality of demolished concrete, and the size and type of plant being used. Lowest cost comes from large quantities of demolished concrete using high output plant and machinery.

Recycled aggregate comes primarily from PCC and AC from road rehabilitation and maintenance, demolition, and leftover batches of AC and PCC. After processing, the rocks retain bits of cement or asphalt. A roadway is built in several layers: pavement, base, and sometimes subbase. The pavement is the surface layer, and is made of PCC or AC.
