## Manganese ore beneficiation methods and equipment summary!
For manganese carbonate ore and manganese oxide ore with simple composition and coarse embedded particle size, better separation indexes can be obtained by using a single high-intensity magnetic separation process. When sorting manganese carbonate ore, the magnetic field intensity of the magnetic separator needs to be more than 480ka / m, while
