Magnetic separation is one of the main beneficiation methods for manganese beneficiation, and magnetic separator is the main equipment in this stage. In actual production, the operation of the magnetic separator has a very obvious influence on the separation index of manganese ore.

## Manganese ore beneficiation methods and equipment summary!
For manganese carbonate ore and manganese oxide ore with simple composition and coarse embedded particle size, better separation indexes can be obtained by using a single high-intensity magnetic separation process. When sorting manganese carbonate ore, the magnetic field intensity of the magnetic separator needs to be more than 480ka / m, while
