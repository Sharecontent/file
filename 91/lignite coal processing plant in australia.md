## Lignite - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics
A practical approach to coal focuses on the heat content and carbon content. According to Speight (2013) anthracite has the highest concentration of carbon (86%-98% w/w), and it has the highest heat value (13,500-15,600 BTU/lb). Lignite is the poorest of the three coals with the lowest heat value and carbon content.
