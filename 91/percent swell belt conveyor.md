## Conveyor Belt Materials • Con Belt
There are five main materials that conveyor belts are made out of: thermoplastics, metal, rubber, fabric and leather. Plastics include polyester, polyvinyl chloride, silicone and polyethylene. The metals are stainless and carbon steel, and the fabric materials are canvas or cotton. The most popular material is a rubber composite because it is

Vicious Circles. If CEMA are actually suggesting that the belt annual cost is 5% it forecasts a belt life of over 20 years. Most manufacturers will only advise an ideal life of 10-12 years because of the environmental degradation of the rubber.

The swell factor can be used to calculate the volume increase. The load factor can be used to calculate the weight of the material per cubic metre/yard from bank to loose state. Multiply the bank weight by the load factor to get loose weight. Example: Basalt has a bank mass density of 4950 lb/yd3 with a swell percentage of 67%

## How to Calculate the Swell Factor of Soil | eHow
Calculating the percentage change in height from the wet soil to the dry will give you a measure of the swell factor of the soil. For example, if the dry soil was 1 inch high and the wet soil is 1.54 inches high, divide 1 by 1.54 and multiply by 100 to get a 65 percent swell factor.
