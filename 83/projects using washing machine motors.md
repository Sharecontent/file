## Dishwasher
A dishwasher is a machine used to clean dishware, cookware and cutlery automatically. Unlike manual dishwashing, which relies heavily on physical scrubbing to remove soiling, the mechanical dishwasher cleans by spraying hot water, typically between 45 and 75 °C (110 and 170 °F), at the dishes, with lower temperatures used for delicate items.. A mix of water and dishwasher detergent is pumped

Motors and controllers can be salvaged from scrapped washing machines. This project delves into reusing the motor controller too.  Many applications for small electric motors use four pole motors (1750 RPM). The motor shaft has a 7/8" pulley and I think the (lost) pulley for the washer provided a 11:1 speed reduction which dropped the motor
