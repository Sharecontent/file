## The importance of gas ballast for vacuum pumps - Vacuum Science World
Originally developed by Wolfgang Gaede in 1935, gas ballast was a significant addition to mechanical, oil-sealed vacuum pumps. When used in mechanical, oil-sealed vacuum pumps, the gas ballast allows the pumping of vapours without them condensing and thus contaminating the pump's sealing-oil. By reducing any potential condensation in the

The ballast pump impeller MUST be replaced on a regular basis (at least annually, but more often may be necessary). Its purpose is to move water from the intake into the ballast tank, and vice versa when emptying the ballast tank. Through usage, the impeller, by design, will wear.

Magnetic ballast is an essential component in traditional discharge lamps and tubes. In order to properly start them, an initial high current is needed which needs to be limited afterwards to prevent the lamp from blowing out. This function is performed by ballast.

## Technical - What the ballast resistor does | The H.A.M.B.
So, the ballast resistor gives the coil a high voltage to start with, making the current flow reach peak quicker, then it reduces the voltage as the total input voltage is split between the coil and the ballast. The shorter ignition coil "charge time" is good on high rpm, expecially on a V8 (or bigger) as there's little time between each

## what is the purpose of ballasta
The ballast resistor allows the ignition system to operate at a lower voltage until the engine starts. After ignition, the alternator begins to recharge the battery, restoring the regular voltage. The ballast resistor then functions to regulate the voltage going to the ignition system to avoid additional wear on the system.
