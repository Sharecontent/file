ALVINA CHIWANIKA. Shurugwi - Unki Mine has managed to bring water pollution caused by its slime dam under control after causing panic among villagers in Gutsaruzhinji who stopped using the water for any purpose. The pollution which affected Mutevekwi River turned the water milky and villagers stopped their goats and cattle from drinking the water while people could not water their gardens or.

## Hard-rock room and pillar - QueensMineDesignWiki
Most hard-rock room and pillar mines are large (2,000 to 7,000 tpd) but there are some very small zinc mines in Illinois-Wisconsin that use room and pillar. One common consistency between these small and large deposits are regular dimensions. When thickness is constantly changing, it is difficult to use room and pillar.

A significant amount of the country's production is obtained from previously mined underground bord and pillar workings. This coal is in the form of pillars and remnants on the roof and floor of the old workings.

The two types of underground coal mining are the conventional mining system and continuous mining system. Continuous mining is the most common form of underground coal mining method and accounts for about 60% of world production (Hancox and Gotz 2014). The mechanized machine used on a Bord and Pillar operation is a continuous mining machine.

During the 19th and 20th Century, the "bord and pillar" method of underground mining was implemented in a number of mines throughout large areas of Newcastle ( NSW ) and Ipswich (QLD) in Australia. With rapid urban development in recent years, many of the old mines have been abandoned and the mined areas have become densely populated.

##  Background review - Subsidence from coal mining activities
Wales and Queensland. Longwall is currently the most common method of underground coal mining in Australia, as it is safer and more efficient in extracting coal than other extraction techniques. 'Bord and pillar' is the oldest coal mining technique used in Australia and was common in New South Wales prior to about 1960.

Mining is an art of extracting valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, usually from an ore body, vein or (coal) seam with minimum unit cost within acceptable social, legal, and regulatory constraints. There are two major methods of underground mining of coal: Bord& Pillar Method and Longwall Method.
