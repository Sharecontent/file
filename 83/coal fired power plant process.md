Coldwater from a water source (river) or expansion process is used to cool steam into water.  The biggest drawback of a coal power plant is its fly ash content and the release of sulfur dioxide during coal burning. All coal-fired power plants are always under the scrutiny of agencies involved in environmental pollution. Also, there is always

## How a Coal Plant Works
How a Coal Plant Works. Coal-fired plants produce electricity by burning coal in a boiler to produce steam. The steam produced, under tremendous pressure, flows into a turbine, which spins a generator to create electricity. The steam is then cooled, condensed back into water and returned to the boiler to start the process over.

During a coal-fired plant's decommissioning process, the electric-generating equipment—such as precipitators, boilers, turbines, and generators—are shut down and operating permits are terminated.Unused coal and materials associated with both the generation process and the buildings and structures are removed. The electric-generating equipment may be used at other plants or sold as scrap.

Stage 2. The second stage is the thermodynamic process. The heat from combustion of the coal boils water in the boiler to produce steam. In modern power plant, boilers produce steam at a high pressure and temperature. The steam is then piped to a turbine. The high pressure steam impinges and expands across a number of sets of blades in the turbine.

By using finely pulverized coal, efficient combustion is assured and high temperatures are achieved. The heat is applied to demineralized water inside the boiler, turning it into steam.
