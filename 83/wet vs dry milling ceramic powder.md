Dry milling can reduce particles down creating a fine powder but the wet milling of particles produces a much finer particle size making it possible to use for a wider range of products. The greatest advantage to this process is that it takes those small fine particles and distributes them evenly throughout the liquid materials.

## Wet Milling vs Dry Milling: The Differences, Advantages, and Challenges 
Jun 17, 2021Now that we have a basic understanding of the industrial milling process, let's examine the difference between wet milling and dry milling. Dry milling typically uses particle-on-particle contact to reduce materials' size, while wet milling involves dispersing the material in a liquid and using solid, grinding elements to reduce size.
