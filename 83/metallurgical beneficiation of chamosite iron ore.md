## Existing and New Processes for Beneficiation of Indian Iron ores
The iron ore industries of India are expected to bring new technologies to cater to the need of the tremendous increase in demand for quality ores for steel making. With the high-grade ores depleting very fast, the focus is on the beneficiation of low-grade resources. However, most of these ores do not respond well to the conventional beneficiation techniques used to achieve a suitable

## A review on the characterisation and processing of oolitic iron ores 
Zhang et al. (2008) used microwave heating prior to beneficiation of an oolitic iron ore from Yichang, China. The ore was ground to <74 µm to achieve liberation of the hematite from the gangue. Reductants used included waste iron powder, coke and charcoal and the reduced product was tested using either magnetic separation or reverse flotation.

## Beneficiation of Iron Ores
Beneficiation of Iron Ores., 1753. These ores ca n be directly used in the production of iron and steel. All other ores need benefaction and certain processing before they are used in t he production of iron and steel. Low grade iron ores cannot be used as such for the production of iron and SST eel and need to be upgraded to reduce its gangue
