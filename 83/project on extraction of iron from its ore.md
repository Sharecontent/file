At the bottom of the furnace the iron ore is chemically reduced. The blast reacts with the coke; carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are formed at temperatures of up to 2000 °C. The carbon monoxide removes the oxygen from the iron ore resulting in pig iron production. Slag is formed from the other ore components and the additions.

Extraction of metal from an ore depends on the place it has in the reactivity series. Following points explain this. Metals found at the bottom of reactivity series are least reactive and they are often found in nature in free-state, such as gold, silver, copper, etc. Copper and silver are also found in the form of sulphide and oxide ores.
