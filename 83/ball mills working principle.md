## ball mills principles
The working principle of ball mill - Meetyou Carbide. 22/05/2019 The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball. The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated, the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal force.
