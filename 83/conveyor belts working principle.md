May 17, 2021A conveyor at 30 degrees has a cosine = 0.866. Therefore, a weight of 40 pounds on the conveyor would result in a measured force of 34.64 lbs on the scale. A fixed angle conveyor scale can be compensated by a change of gain in the scale. In the above example, 34.64 lbs/cos. (30)=40 pounds.

The Fundamentals. Belt conveyors consist of a drive roller powered by a drive motor with a tension roller at the opposite end moving an endless loop of the conveyor belt which rotates around them. The belt is supported by a "skid" base or a roller base. The belt is returned on a series of return rollers.

Aug 4, 2021The main working principle of the belt conveyor is: the belt conveyor is mainly composed of two end rollers and a closed conveyor belt tightly sleeved on them. The roller that drives the conveyor belt to rotate is called the driving roller; the other roller that only changes the direction of the conveyor belt is called the reversing roller.
