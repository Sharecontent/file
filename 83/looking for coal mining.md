The use of coal can be traced back to around A.D. 50 from cinders in Roman ruins in Britain. There is also evidence to suggest that the Greeks used coal as a fuel in the 4th century. However, extensive mining of coal in Britain only started in the 13th century. To find out how coal was mined in the 18th century, try this web page.

Although the rich coal deposits beneath Cherryhill and Green Townships had been surveyed before the turn of the century, the first large-scale mining in the area was undertaken by the Clearfield Bituminous Coal Corporation. The C.B.C. was formed in 1886 by a reorganization of the old Clearfield Bituminous Coal Company.

The energy-intensive nature of mining is evident by the recovery ratio of the various materials being mined.
