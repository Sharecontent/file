## Dry beneficiation of iron ore - Mineral Processing
The haematite ore in South Africa is processed in a dry process to a HQ lump ore with 64 % iron content and a sintered fine ore with 63.5 % iron content. For fine ore beneficiation, wet processes are used. Capacity at the Minas Rio is to be increased from 26.5 Mta capacity to 28 Mta in the forthcoming years.

## Considerations for Beneficiation of Low Grade Iron Ore for Steel Making 
The iron and steel industry will be prominent in the industrialization process for the country to realize its goals of the vision 2030. There will be great demand of the metal, for example, needed in the manufacture of machines, components and reinforcing rods for the construction. Though quite involving, steel is basically made by smelting iron ore charged with coke is a blast furnace.
