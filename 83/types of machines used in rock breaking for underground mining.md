## types of machine used in open pit mining
Open pit mines can be used in coal mining, and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores, copper, gold, iron, aluminum, and many minerals. In a open pit coal mine, the pit bottom would be the bottom mined coal seam elevation, since it is usually feasible to extract multiple seams when surface mining coal.

Open-pit mining. Open-pit mining is the activity of removing the earth to access the mineral deposits and continuing to do it vertically in an open-pit. This method is best suited for mineral deposits that are close to the surface of the earth but are not accumulated in a horizontal manner. Open-pit mining often impacts a narrower surface area.

## Quick Guide to Hard Rock Mining | An Underground Miner
Jan 28, 2021The techniques are the same, but each mining method uses specific equipment types to help with the mining process. Some years ago, miners used to use the old method known as "charge-and-blast" while clearing the rooms out. Nowadays, things are different, and miners depend on machines, which are used to drill a room until it is completely excavated.

## types of machines used in rock breaking for underground mining
The type of rock drill used in mining drilling is generally determined by the hole diameter required and the mechanical properties, principally hardness, of the rock. A top hammer is commonly employed for drilling of holes less than 125 mm in diameter in all but the hardest rock, although a rotary cutting method may instead be used for soft rock.

Underground mining (hard rock) Wikipedia. Underground hard rock mining refers to various underground mining techniques used to excavate hard minerals, usually those containing metals such as ore containing gold, silver, iron, copper, zinc, nickel, tin and lead, but also involves using the same techniques for excavating ores of gems such as diamonds or rubies.

Nov 3, 2021The Main Types of Rock Drills. There are two main types of drills, which are hydraulic and pneumatic. Hydraulic drills are also known as top-hammer drills, and they are the most common types of drills. Their popularity is mainly because they are more robust. As a result, they can drill holes even in the hardest of rocks.

Auger Drilling. Auger drilling is the simplest form of drilling. It involves the manual rotation of a helical screw into the ground, usually by two people although auger drills can also be mounted to small vehicles. Once the auger drill is deep enough, the earth is lifted up by the blade of the screw.

Shrinkage stoping refers to any overhand method in which the stope is kept full of broken ore until it is completed. The miners stand on top of the broken ore and work at the back. As broken ore takes up more space than ore in a solid mass, about 35 to 40 per cent, of it must be drawn to leave room for working.
