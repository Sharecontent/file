During roasting, refractory gold ore is treated with extremely hot air. This causes the sulfites to oxidize, separate from the ore, and become sulfur dioxide. Once all of the sulfides are oxidized, the remaining gold ore can be processed normally. The roasting method has been around for hundreds of years. Prior to the 20th century, the process

## Gold Ore Roasting Techniques - Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Roasting and Processing Sulpho-telluride ore to recover gold. This roasting plant, since closed down, was equipped with eight standard 70-spindle Edwards roasters, though only four were finally in use. Fuel was supplied to four ports on each furnace in the form of pulverized lignite of 8500 B.t.u. value prepared at a central plant.

Dec 4, 2020The smelting process is about extracting the precious metal from its ore. The process yields about 90% of pure gold. However, this percentage of gold is not acceptable in the industry, as it comes with other minerals, such as copper, silver, iron, or aluminum. Smelting comes as the most crucial step of the entire gold mining.

According to the degree of ore oxidation, gold ore can be divided into primary (sulfide ore) ore, partially oxidized (mixed) ore and oxidized ore. Here are the different kind of gold ore processing methods used for five types of gold ore . Poor sulfide gold ore processing. Polysulfide gold ore processing. Gold-bearing polymetallic ore processing.
