## What is Land Degradation?
Land degradation is a negative change in the quality of land, usually induced by a mixture of natural and man-made causes. It affects the land's topsoil, the vegetation that grows on it, and the nearby water sources. It is a global issue with millions of people being affected, even forcing them to relocate in some cases.
