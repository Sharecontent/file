You don't need to grind your pebbles into a powder when you're using mercury sulfide (HgS) to extract the gold. How do you tell if a rock has gold in it?

## What Kind Of Rocks Have Gold In Them - Realonomics
What does real gold look like in rock? Raw gold in rocks appears as threads of a yellow-gold color winding its way through quartz. Where is gold most likely to be found? Gold is primarily found as the pure native metal. Sylvanite and calaverite are gold-bearing minerals. Gold is usually found embedded in quartz veins or placer stream gravel.

## Extracting gold from rock - OpenLearn - Open University
When you mix the finely powdered gold-bearing rock with some mercury, the gold within the rock dissolves, to form what's called a gold amalgam. The next step in the process is to separate the gold amalgam from any 'unreacted' mercury. We did this by squeezing the crude amalgam through a small piece of chamois leather.

## Extracting Gold | HowStuffWorks
To isolate pure gold, mining companies use a complex extraction process. The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces. At a mill, large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel. The gravel-like material then enters rotating drums filled with steel balls.

## how to extract gold from rock
Hard-rock mining, which makes up the majority of today's commercial gold sourcing, requires a more in-depth, chemical-reliant extraction process. The most used approach, in this case, is gold cyanidation, which, in short, uses a cyanide-based solution to separate precious metals from encapsulating rock.
