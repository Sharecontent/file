Mineral beneficiation in South Africa. The concept of beneficiation is not new in South Africa, but it took major steps forward during the 1990s. During this period, the South African mining sector changed from being a predominantly primary commodity exporter to becoming a world exporter of processed minerals.

South Africa is a major supplier of coal, platinum group metals, gold, diamonds, chrome, iron ore, vanadium and manganese. Although South Africa has exceptional mineral resources, further downstream and upstream beneficiation has not fully reached its full economic potential, mainly due to structural conditions within key value chains.
