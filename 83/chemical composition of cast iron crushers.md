## Concrete
Concrete is a composite material composed of fine and coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement (cement paste) that hardens (cures) over time. Concrete is the second-most-used substance in the world after water, and is the most widely used building material. Its usage worldwide, ton for ton, is twice that of steel, wood, plastics, and aluminum combined.

Therefore, in exceptional cases, alloyed cast iron with less than 2 % C can solidify with a eutectic structure and therefore still belong to the family of 'cast irons'. The formation of stable or metastable eutectic is a function of many factors, which include the nucleation potential of the liquid, chemical composition, and cooling rate.
