## Deep decarbonisation of cement production | News | gasworld
Concrete is produced by mixing cement with aggregate and allowing that to harden, or cure.". The limestone and clay require a tremendous amount of energy to heat them in the process. Furthermore, the calcination reaction is endothermic and requires energy to liberate the carbon dioxide from the limestone. Heating typically accounts for 30-35%

Limestone is a natural rock that is made up of mostly calcium carbonate. It is common in many parts of the country and is used to create cement, asphalt, many home products, and lots of other things. It is an integral part of the building community and shows up in buildings in its root form as well as in cement and other materials.

## Cement production and emissions | Norcem
When limestone is heated, a chemical process called calcination is initiated, where CO 2 is burned off the limestone. Most of the emissions from the cement industry derive from the calcination process, the rest from heating the furnaces and transportation. In cement production, large amounts of CO 2 are emitted, about 1 tonne of CO 2 per tonne

Slag cement is the byproduct of steel production. It is formed by the molten slag in blast furnaces used to process iron ore to make steel. Finely ground limestone can replace 5% to 15% of portland cement. Portland-limestone cements require less energy to produce because the limestone is not pyroprocessed like the portland cement it replaces.
