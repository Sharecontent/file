Dolomite is a common rock-forming mineral. It is a calcium magnesium carbonate with a chemical composition of CaMg (CO 3) 2. It is the primary component of the sedimentary rock known as dolostone and the metamorphic rock known as dolomitic marble. Limestone that contains some dolomite is known as dolomitic limestone.

In sedimentary dolostones, dolomite is most often associated with calcite, aragonite, gypsum, anhydrite, chert, and halite. Vein deposits of dolomite occur with quartz and other common vein minerals, such as calcite, magnesite, fluorite, siderite, and sphalerite, or with metallic ore minerals such as galena, pyrite and chalcopyrite.

Mica. Mica is a naturally occurring non-metallic mineral that is based on a collection of silicates. Mica is a very good insulator that has a wide range of applications in electrical and electronics industry. It can withstand high voltage and has low power loss factor. It is used in toothpaste and cosmetics because of its glittery appearance.

The Dolomite Group is composed of minerals with an unusual trigonal bar 3 symmetry. The general formula of this group is AB (CO3)2, where A can be either calcium, barium and/or strontium and the B can be either iron, magnesium, zinc and/or manganese. The structure of the Dolomite Group is taken from the Calcite Group structure.
