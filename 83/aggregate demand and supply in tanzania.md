Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Notes : Aggregate demand refers to the total demand of all goods and services in an economy during an accounting year. It is measured in the terms of aggregate expenditure on ex-ante (planned). All goods and services that people are willing to incur at different income level is known as Aggregate Demand.

Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Economics. Aggregate supply refers to the quantity of goods and services that firms are willing and able to supply. The relationship between this quantity and the price level is different in the long and short run. So we will develop both a short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve.

An increase in any of the components of aggregate demand - consumption spending, investment spending, government spending, and net exports (X-M) - shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right, and a fall in any of these components shifts it to the left. A shift from AD to AD1 reflects an increase in aggregate demand.
