## Static Electricity Detector using 2N3819 MOSFET
The main component of this project is the 2N3819 Field-effect transistor FET. It is a kind of transistor that uses the electric field to control the flow of current. This is a very interesting and simple project of a highly sensitive static electricity detector circuit, it can also be used as an ion detector, electric field detector, etc.

Pyrite is the classic "Fool's Gold". There are other shiny brassy yellow minerals, but pyrite is by far the most common and the most often mistaken for gold. Whether it is the golden look or something else, pyrite is a favorite among rock collectors. It can have a beautiful luster and interesting crystals. It is so common in the earth's

## Pyrite - Fool's Gold | Mojave Gold Mining
Pyrite - Fool's Gold. Pyrite. Pyrite, or iron pyrite, also known as fool's gold, is an iron disulfide mineral containing iron and sulfur. The name fool's gold comes from novice prospectors commonly mistaking it for gold. Pyrite has a brassy sheen, and unlike gold which is malleable, pyrite will crush into a brown powder.

## Static Electricity & Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) - Basic - Omazaki Group
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is defined as the rapid, spontaneous transfer of electrostatic charge induced by a high electrostatic field. ESD is also a build-up of charges over a specific area without current flow. Another definition of electrostatic discharge is an uncontrolled surge of static between objects with different voltage potentials.

## Pyrite: Fool's Gold - Geology In
Pyrite is an iron sulfide with the chemical formula FeS 2 (iron (II) disulfide). Pyrite is considered the most common of the sulfide minerals. Pyrite is sometimes called Fools Gold because of its similarity in color and shape to Gold. In the old mining days, Pyrite was sometimes mistaken for Gold, as they frequently occur together.

Description. Commonly called fool's gold, pyrite is the Earth's most abundant sulfide mineral. Recognized for its brass-yellow color which resembles that of gold, pyrite is a source of iron and sulfur and is used for the production of sulfuric acid. Some types of pyrite contain enough microscopic gold to warrant mining them as a gold ore.

The most distinct difference between gold and pyrite is in their hardness. Gold is one of the most malleable and ductile metals on earth. The mineral can take any shape when flattened and is easily scratched with a pocket knife. Pyrite is noticeably harder with a hardness of 6 on Mohs scale while gold is at a 3.
