## Effect of Granite Dust as Partial Replacement to Natural Sand on 
To study the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams made with granite dust as a replacement to natural sand, four beams of size 150 mm × 150 mm × 1100 mm were cast for CC01, GD10, GD15, and GD20 mix designations. Two numbers of 10-mm-diameter TMT bars were provided with each at the top and the bottom of the beam as shown in Fig. 2a. Shear

## What are the Materials for Replacement of Sand in Concrete?
Instead of disposing them in landfills, it can be best utilized as partial replacement to sand. In crusher dust, the particles (% finer than 150 microns) are generally high, a major concern limiting its percentage replacement to minimum with sand in a concrete mix. It can be replaced to the amount 25%. Its Availability is not a concern.
