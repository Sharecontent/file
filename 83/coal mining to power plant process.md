## Impacts of coal-fired power plants for energy generation on environment 
Flue gases, bottom ash, and fly ash formed during fuel combustion are examples of pollution occurring from the combustion process. Land use of the power plant, coal mining and transport, and feeding of the coal to the combustion chambers can also cause pollution. The cooling water is another pollution source to the surrounding water systems.

Coal, based on the current extraction rates, will last about 115 years longer than conventional oil and gas reserves, with an estimated 1.1 trillion tonnes of proven coal reserves worldwide. Ten countries are responsible for 90% of the total global coal production.
