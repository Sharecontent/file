Nov 28, 2021On passing the ore via an upward stream of water, the lighter gangue particles are separated from the heavier metal ore. This is a gravity separation method. This process is used to enrich ores that are heavier than the gangue particles that are present in them. A stream of water is run through crushed and finely powdered ore in this procedure.

## Beneficiation process of copper ore - Fodamon Machinery
Beneficiation process of copper ore. Generally use relatively simple processes, through a grinding fineness -200 mesh about 50% to 70%, 1 roughing, 2 or 3 times selected, 1 or 2 times sweep the election. Comparison of disseminated copper minerals, such as small size, may consider the stage of grinding and separation processes.
