## Biodiversity
Biodiversity is not evenly distributed, rather it varies greatly across the globe as well as within regions. Among other factors, the diversity of all living things depends on temperature, precipitation, altitude, soils, geography and the presence of other species.The study of the spatial distribution of organisms, species and ecosystems, is the science of biogeography.

## Mining, Development and Environment: A Case Study of Bijolia Mining 
Abstract Mining is essentially a destructive development activity where ecology suffers at the altar of economy. Unfortunately in most regions of earth, the underground geological resources (minerals) are superimposed by above ground biological resources (forests). This is particularly more prominent in India. Hence mining operations necessarily involves deforestation, habitat destruction and

Those slopes that are below 100 metres from the ground are not to be treated as hills. According to the CEC report, there are 261 mining leases in the Aravalli hill range in Rajasthan.

Mine drainage is metal-rich water formed from a chemical reaction between water and rocks containing sulfur-bearing minerals. The resulting chemicals in the water are sulfuric acid and dissolved iron. Some or all of this iron can come out as solids to form the red, orange, or yellow sediments in the bottom of streams containing mine drainage.

Effects on plants. Mining can also have severe adverse effects on plants. Plants usually require a certain pH-level to grow. This pH-level is often altered through mining activities. Thus, many plants will no longer grow efficiently and will lose their fertility which may lead to the local extinction of some plant species.

But hydraulic mining was still widely used in placer gold mines on Alaska in the early 20 th century. Today, hydraulic gold mining is only rarely practiced on an industrial scale, but gold mines on Alaska sometimes use it. It survives mostly in artisanal form in remote, undeveloped and largely unregulated areas of the world.

## Effects Of Mining on the Environment and Human Health
Impacts of strip mining: Strip mining destroys landscapes, forests and wildlife habitats at the site of the mine when trees, plants, and topsoil are cleared from the mining area. This in turn leads to soil erosion and destruction of agricultural land. When rain washes the loosened top soil into streams, sediments pollute waterways.
