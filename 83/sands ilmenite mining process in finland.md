## How to separate sand rutile ilmenite and zircon?
How are mineral sands extracted? Mineral sands are mined by surface mining methods including open cut mining, suction dredging and hydraulic mining. The first stage of the mining process is to remove all timber and topsoil from the mine site. The topsoil is stockpiled for later rehabilitation of the site after mining has been completed.

Asbestos also occurs in water exposed to asbestos mining discharges, and in asbestos-cement pipe. Studies have also found that precipitation may result in surface water contamination through scavenging of airborne asbestos.8 Anthropogenic sources of asbestos fibers in water include mining operations and use of products containing asbestos.
