thickness in cold rolling, a series of rolling mills may be used to share the total reduction. One important application of cold rolling is the removal of yield point from mild steel sheets using skin pass rolling [temper rolling]. In this the steel sheet is given a light reduction of 0.5 to 1.5% . Such a process eliminates yield point elongation.

## Hot rolling mill process and hot rolled steel sections - Montanstahl
Hot rolling mills typically produce sections of steel at various dimensions from billets of steel. The manufactoring process involves passing bars of steel at high temperatures. This happens through rotating rolls to reduce the thickness and shape the sections. It furthers proceeds into cooling and cutting to length or coiling into rolls for

## Steel Manufacturing Process - AIST
The molten steel is formulated to precise chemical compositions during the secondary refining processes. The refined steel is then cast into a variety of solid shapes usually by a continuous casting method. The solidified shapes are processed into finished goods by various processes, including hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing and coating.

Rolling is the process of plastically deforming steel by passing it between rolls. Rolling is defined as the reduction of the cross sectional area of the steel piece being rolled, or the general shaping of the steel products, through the use of the rotating rolls. Rolling of steel is one of the most important manufacturing processes for steel.

## Rolling Process: Definition, Working Principle, Application, and 
Rolling Process Definition. The rolling process is a metalworking operation in which metal strips pass through a set of rollers to reduce sheet thickness and achieve uniform thickness throughout the sheet. The sheet is deformed along the linear axis. Typically after the rolling, metal sheets go through annealing which is done under a closed environment of nitrogen.
