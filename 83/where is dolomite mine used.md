Historic sites and inspiring scenery collide on the path to this fascinating yet forgotten part of Greater Palm Springs' past. Tucked away within the remote wilderness of the Santa Rosa Mountains lie the remains of a once-thriving dolomite mine; the naturally occurring mineral was used as roofing material for many of the older homes in the area (some of which can still be seen today).

## When did dolomite mining started in cebu?
What is dolomite mining? Dolomite is a calcium magnesium carbonate mineral which has many characteristics similar to calcite. In places where access to limestone is not available or more costly, dolomites are used in its place for the basic materials from which most building stone and a significant percentage of crushed stone are produced.
