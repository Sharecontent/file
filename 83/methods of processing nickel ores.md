## Processing of oxidized nickel ores with ammonium chloride
A method for processing nickel ores with ammonium chloride is considered. The results of thermodynamic calculations for the reactions of the oxide components of nickel ore with ammonium chloride are given. Thermogravimetric and kinetic investigations were performed. The technological sequence of the separation of oxidized nickel ores into individual oxides was developed.

The SX-EW Method. SX-EW, or the Solvent Extraction - Electrowinning approach to lateritic ore beneficiation, is a hydrometallurgical method that relies on leaching, extractants, and electrowinning to produce nickel from ore. This process is often referred to as Leach Solvent Extraction - Electrowinning for its employment of a leaching step.

Most nickel ores have several recoverable metals in them and the process if commonly a multiple stream of metals recovered. The copper concentrate is sent to the copper smelter and 99.99% copper cathode is produced in electrowinning cells. The nickel ore is sent to the nickel refinery, where a complex set of reactions is carried out.

Ores Sulfides. Canadian ores are sulfides containing nickel, copper, and iron. The most important nickel mineral is pentlandite, (Ni, Fe) 9 S 8, followed by pyrrhotite, usually ranging from FeS to Fe 7 S 8, in which some of the iron may be replaced by nickel. Chalcopyrite, CuFeS 2, is the dominant copper mineral in these ores, with small amounts of another copper mineral, cubanite, CuFe 2 S 3.

## What Are the Common Nickel Mineral Processing Technologies?
2. Nickel oxide ore dressing method. Most of the nickel oxide ore is in the form of nickel laterite, which contains less silicon and magnesium and contains 1-2% nickel. Secondly, nickel silicate ore is mainly used, which contains higher silicon magnesium and lower iron, and the content of nickel is 1.6~4%.

## Pre-concentration of nickel in laterite ores using physical separation 
metallurgy and therefore, pre-concentration of nickel before such processes is very important. This paper examines the effects of different physical methods on pre-concentration of nickel in laterite ores. The effect of ore mineralogy on choosing the best strategy to upgrade nickel will be discussed. The findings of this project will help to
