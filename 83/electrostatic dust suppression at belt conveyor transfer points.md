1. Drilling Suppression of dust produced by drilling is achieved mainly by adopting wet drilling. • Wet drilling has proved very effective in dust suppression. whereas the dust concentration during dry drilling may be as high as 5000 p.p.c.c. or more, it is brought down to only 200 to 400 p.p.c.c.

The most efficient approach for dust suppression of conveyor belts and transfer points is to have the material as close to its Dust Extinction Mosture (DEM) level as early in the process as possible. If this is not practical then a structure to physical contain the dust would provide significant benefit. The final and least efficient approach

Belt conveyors and associated transfer points are one of the most common areas where dust emissions pose a challenge to bulk material handling and processing operations. Typically the material drop or discharge point and material impact point are where dust is generated. DSI DryFog Dust Suppression systems address both areas of dust creation.

Generally speaking, nozzles are used to pre-wet material or to suppress the dust when it leaves the confines of barrier type suppression systems (eg enclosed transfer points on conveyors). In this discussion, we refer to temporary, small and medium spray nozzles, not larger spraying devices, such as stockpile sprays or water cannons.

## Dust at conveyor transfer points and air velocity - Martin Eng
Enlarged settling zones can slow air and allow dust to settle back to the conveyor. An effectively designed transfer chute reduces the air velocity by minimizing air drawn into the transfer point, sealing the leaks that allow dust-bearing air to escape and allowing the dust time to settle out of the air. The traditional transfer-point enclosure is the most common method used to combat dust.
