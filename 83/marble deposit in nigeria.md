The Greenbushes deposit has the highest grade lithium mineral resource in the world at 3.9% Li 2 O, compared to 1.0-2.0% Li 2 O normally documented for other hard rock deposits. Lithium ore in the form of the mineral spodumene (LiAl(SiO 3) 2) is mined from unweathered zones of the pegmatite. Other products include tin and tantalite concentrate
