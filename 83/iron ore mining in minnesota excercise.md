1 Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine ! Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine! born of his Spirit, washed in his blood. praising my Savior all the day long. praising my Savior all the day long. visions of rapture now burst on my sight. echoes of mercy, whispers of love. [Refrain] 3 Perfect submission, all is at rest.
