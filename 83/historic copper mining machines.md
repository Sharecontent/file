Located near Gällivare, northern Sweden, the low-grade Aitik copper deposit was discovered in the early 1930s. Bulk-mining technology made exploitation feasible in the 1960s and mining at Europe's first large, low-grade open pit copper mine started in 1968 at a production rate of 2Mt/y of ore.Since then, a series of pushbacks have increased output to approximately 19Mt/y.
