## Primary and Secondary Sources: What's the Difference?
While a primary source provides direct access to a work for you to discuss, analyze, and cite it, a secondary source gives you a look at that work through another writer's lens. For example, the text of a president's speech is a primary source, while a political commentator's column discussing that speech is a secondary source.

## Supergene (geology)
In ore deposit geology, supergene processes or enrichment are those that occur relatively near the surface as opposed to deep hypogene processes. Supergene processes include the predominance of meteoric water circulation (i.e. water derived from precipitation) with concomitant oxidation and chemical weathering.The descending meteoric waters oxidize the primary (hypogene) sulfide ore minerals

## What is the difference between Primary and Secondary sources 
Oct 21, 2021Primary sources can be described as those sources that are closest to the origin of the information. They contain raw information and thus, must be interpreted by researchers. Secondary sources are closely related to primary sources and often interpret them. These sources are documents that relate to information that originated elsewhere.

## Primary vs Secondary Sources: Meaning, Examples & Differences - Formpl
The main difference is that a primary source is an original document or firsthand account while a secondary source is a second-hand account of information. A primary source is not an original document, but something that was written at the time of the event. A secondary source is an interpretation of the primary source.

## Differences Between Primary and Secondary Sources
Primary sources are first-hand accounts of a topic while secondary sources are any account of something that is not a primary source. Published research, newspaper articles, and other media are typical secondary sources. Secondary sources can, however, cite both primary sources and secondary sources. Not all evidence is of equal value and weight.
