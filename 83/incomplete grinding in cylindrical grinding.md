## Cylindrical grinding
Cylindrical grinding is defined as having four essential actions: 1. The work (object) must be constantly rotating. 2. The grinding wheel must be constantly rotating. 3. The grinding wheel is fed towards and away from the work. 4. Either the work or the grinding wheel is traversed with respect to the other.

With the in-feed method, the regulating wheel spins the part at one speed while pushing it towards the grinding wheel, which is spinning at a faster speed. The greater the difference in speeds, the faster the removal rate. 4. The choice of grinding wheel is critical. Another key factor in centerless grinding is the choice of grinding wheel.

## Internal Cylindrical Grinding - Radiac Abrasives
Internal Cylindrical Grinding. In comparison with other grinding operations, internal cylindrical grinding wheels have to compensate for a number of process-related disadvantages: As a result of the small diameter, there are fewer abrasive grains on the circumference. Each single grain is subjected to a significantly higher load.
