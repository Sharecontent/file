## The Production of Industrial Paint (Emulsion Paint)
According to Osai Yaw Ababio (1990), new school chemistry, "emulsion is a colloidal system in which a liquid is dispersed in another liquid", or emulsion is a two-phase system containing two immiscible liquid to which an emulsifier is added. It can also be seen as a very fine dispersion of one liquid in another with which it is immiscible.

## kaolinite | mineral | Britannica
kaolinite, group of common clay minerals that are hydrous aluminum silicates; they comprise the principal ingredients of kaolin (china clay). The group includes kaolinite and its rarer forms, dickite and nacrite, halloysite, and allophane, which are chemically similar to kaolinite but amorphous. Kaolinite, nacrite, and dickite occur as minute, sometimes elongated, hexagonal plates in compact
