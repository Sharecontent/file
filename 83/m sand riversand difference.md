## Difference Between M Sand and River Sand - Civil Lead
The source of m sand is query and factory. Whereas river sand is naturally available and it is usually excavated from the river bed or riverbank by digging. 2. There is no wastage in m sand since sand is already saved in the required size that is below 4.75 mm. Whereas in the case of river sand the wastage is more as compared to crushed sand.
