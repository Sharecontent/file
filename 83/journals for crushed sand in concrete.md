## Performance of Fly Ash blended Crushed Sand Concrete
Achieving low permeability in concrete property is an important requirement for safety-related nuclear reprocessing plant structures. Towards this need, in view of the scarcity of river sand, M50 grade crushed sand (CS) aggregate concrete with controlled fines content and fly ash has been designed. This paper discusses workability, mechanical strength, chloride permeability and temperature

Stabilize the Foundations When disbursed, fill the excavation with rubble, stone, gravel, tiles or broken bricks, etc. and finish with stabilized or compacted sand . However, for a simple footpath, sand and gravel are sufficient. You can now place a 3 to 5 cm bed of sand on your foundations to start laying your pavers.

Manufactured sand (M-Sand) is a substitute of river sand for concrete construction . Manufactured sand is produced from hard granite stone by crushing. The crushed sand is of cubical shape with grounded edges, washed and graded to as a construction material. The size of manufactured sand (M-Sand) is less than 4.75mm.

The paper presents an industrial case study where possibilities of removing the excess of fines from crushed sand are investigated in full-scale sand washing experiments. The results are in line with previously reported investigations on laboratory scale, and indicate that the used washing technique primarily reduced the amount of material in size fractions below about 250 µm with emphasis on

The percentage passing 150 microns of manufactured sand is relaxed to 20 (while that of natural sand is limited to 10 ). As per design and economics, crushed sand can be used to partially or fully replace river sand from a concrete mix. The Availability of crushed sand is not a concern as it can be manufactured from rocks in any season.

The cement in concrete is replaced accordingly with the percentage of 10 %, 20% and 30% by weight of slag and 1% by weight of sisal fibre. Concrete cubes are tested at the age of 7, 14, and 28 days of curing. Finally, the strength performance of slag blended fibre reinforced concrete is compared with the performance of conventional concrete.
