## Iron Ore Price: LIVE Iron Ore Price Today | Iron Ore Price per Ounce 
Iron ore is a type of rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted. Hematite and Magnetite are the two principal iron ores found in the earth. Most of the iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks. The ores are formed by the combination of iron and oxygen in fresh and marine water, through a chemical reaction.

Historically, Tennessee's most important mining products have been iron, bituminous coal, copper, lead, zinc, and phosphate. Iron ore was the most significant during early settlement years. Interest in the iron ore of the Western Highland Rim dates back to the 1790s and even earlier in the eastern mountains.

## Iron Ore Mining | Techniques | Metal Extraction
Iron is concentrated by the process of calcinations. Once it is concentrated, the water and other volatile impurities such as sulfur and carbonates are removed. This concentrated ore is then mixed with limestone (CaCO 3) and Coke and fed into the blast furnace from the top. It is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.

## how is iron ore mined today
IRON MINING TODAY Open pit mining for iron ore replaced shaft mining very early on in the history of the Michigan Iron Ranges. Today, all the underground mines are closed, and only a very few open pit mines are still operating. What remains of the underground mines is often only a few heaps of waste rocks (below) and some slumped landscapes.

What is Iron Ore? Earth's most important iron ore deposits are found in sedimentary rocks.They formed from chemical reactions that combined iron and oxygen in marine and fresh waters. The two most important minerals in these deposits are iron oxides: hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).These iron ores have been mined to produce almost every iron and steel object that we use today
