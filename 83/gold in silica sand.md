## Sand - Density - Heat Capacity - Thermal Conductivity
About Sand. Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles. The composition of sand varies, depending on the local rock sources and conditions, but the most common constituent of sand in inland continental settings and non-tropical coastal settings is silica (silicon dioxide, or SiO2), usually in the form of quartz.

## Silica Sand - Cairo Minerals
The name Silica (SiO2) is provided to a handful of minerals solely made up of silicon and oxygen. Mostly it is found in the crystalline state. It is also found in an amorphous form which comes as a result of weathering or plankton fossilization. Silica-sand deposits are generally mined and dug out in open pit processes.

After oxygen, silica is the most abundant element in sand and soil, and is found mostly as silicon dioxide. In the soil, it helps seeds to germinate by breaking through their hard outer shell and, if soil lacks silica, very few seeds would sprout naturally. In biodynamics it is recognised as an essential mineral and is added to composts.
