Stone resin is made by taking shards of stone, binding them with a strong adhesive and molding them in with a special resin. The resulting mixture is then capped with acrylic or other coatings to ensure that the surface and core is protected and scratch resistant. And, because it is made from resin, the material is much lighter than normal.

Aggregates. Aggregates are of two main types - crushed rock and sand and gravel. Some examples of their use include hard-core for use under concrete slabs and footpaths, infill for roads and drainage stone on farms. In addition aggregates are a key ingredient in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete products.
