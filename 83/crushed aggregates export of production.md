## Aggregate production: Fines generation during rock crushing
The absence of natural aggregate at cost-effective transportation distances has prompted extensive use of manufactured aggregates. The US aggregate industry produces ∼ 1.1 billion tons of crushed stone per year with carbonates and granites accounting for 71% and 16%, respectively . The extensive use of manufactured aggregates has required

Aggregates. Aggregates are of two main types - crushed rock and sand and gravel. Some examples of their use include hard-core for use under concrete slabs and footpaths, infill for roads and drainage stone on farms. In addition aggregates are a key ingredient in the manufacture of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete products.
