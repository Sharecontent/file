## Estimation ofcarcenter
Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves for industrial minerals requires special care. The estimation of an industrial minerals deposit is affected to a significant degree by a number of factors that are less applicable to metallic mineral deposits, including: particular physical and chemical characteristics; mineral quality issues; market size; the level of the producer's.

## Mineral Resources - Examples of Minerals, Types, Characteristics & Uses 
Here are some measures to conserve minerals: Use of minerals in a planned and sustainable manner. Recycling of metals; Use of alternative renewable substitutes. Technology should be improved to use the low-grade ores profitably. Any minerals usually occur as well-developed crystals and are treated in their crystal types.
