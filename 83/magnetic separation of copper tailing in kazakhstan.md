## Study on comprehensive utilization of secondary resources
Recoveries of copper and associated gold and silver have been greatly increased. The tailings obtained were subjected to the gravitational separation-magnetic separation process to recover iron minerals. Tailings from iron separation are taken as fillers and sent to the pit underground. Thus, the secondary resources are comprehensively utilized.

## Copper Ore Processing Plant - Fote Machinery
Magnetic Separation of Copper Ore Beneficiation Production Line. The copper ore of a copper mine in Zimbabwe is mainly copper-bearing pyrrhotite and high-copper skarn ore. The copper grade of the original ore is 1.25%, and its iron grade is 30.73%.  4 Adopt magnetic separation of iron for copper tailings. Finished products:

## Improvement of Processing of Gold-Bearing Sulfide Minerals by Treatment 
It is shown experimentally that preliminary modification of magnetic properties of gold-bearing minerals by magnetic-colloid treatment allows increasing the gold recovery into magnetic fraction in subsequent magnetic separation. The gold content in the magnetic product increased by 2.13%, its recovery to tailings decreased from 22.18 to 17.08%.
