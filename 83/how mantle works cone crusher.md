The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does. The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion. That means it doesn't stay in the center of the chamber - it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave. This is what creates the crushing action. At a given point on the concave, material is

A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel. Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point. As the wedge or eccentric rotates to cause the compression within the chamber, the

How A Cone Crusher Works The moving cone of the cone crusher performs a swing motion under the action of the eccentric sleeve. The material is continuously squeezed impacted and broken in the crushing cavity formed by the bowl liner and the mantle liner and falls from the mantle swing gap that meets the discharge requirements.
