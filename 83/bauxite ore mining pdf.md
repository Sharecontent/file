## Radiological Assessment for Bauxite Mining and Alumina Refining
Potential radiological impacts from mining and processing are mainly due to the radiation associated with radionuclides 232 Th and 238 U and their decay products, and there is a relatively small, essentially negligible, contribution to radiation dose estimates from 40 K in the bauxite. The approximate K chemical concentration of 0.2 wt % in bauxite ore corresponds to a K-40 activity of 0.062

Proven resources presently exceed 2.5 billion tonnes of bauxite, while processable reserves may amount to 1.5 billion tonnes. Most of Jamaica's bauxite is red or reddish-brown, a peculiarity which indicates the occurrence of iron mineral in the ore. There is no overburden covering the bauxite, as is the case in many other countries.

Advantages: Bronze is an alloy consisting mainly of copper but the addition of other metals (usually tin) produces an alloy much harder than plain copper. Bronze resists corrosion and metal fatigue better, and conducts heat and electricity, better than most steels. Disadvantages: Bronzes are generally softer, weaker and more expensive than steel.
