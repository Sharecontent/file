Put the rock powder in a mining pan. A mining pan has holes in the bottom of it like a colander. Because gold is heavy, it will sink to the bottom of the mining pan even while it's submerged in water, while the other minerals wash away. Pour a layer of rock powder onto the mining pan so you can extract the gold pieces.

The principle was very simple but devastating — water under pressure would be directed against a bank of gravel deposits and the hillside would wash away rapidly. The debris would wash into a series of huge sluice boxes that would catch the gold. The first use of this method is credited to Edward Mattison in 1853.
