## Subgrades & Subbases for Concrete Slabs - Concrete Network
Concrete strength also comes into play, but most slab concrete is around 3000 to 4000 psi, so it's not a major factor. The tensile strength of concrete is typically taken as 10 to 15% of the compressive strength, so only about 400 or 500 psi. Compare that to the tensile strength of Grade 60 rebar, which is 60,000 psi.

2. If you want a decorative driveway, but don't want gravel, crushed stone is a perfect thing for your driveway. Crushed stone looks more angular instead of round, so it's just more decorative and will set off your driveway better than gravel. 3. Crushed stone is great in paving blocks and concrete for sidewalks.

Crushed stone is one of the most reliable base materials you can use under a patio surface of pavers or slabs. Dig a patio base 10 inches below grade and lay a flat base of 2 inches of sand. After leveling, place sheets of erosion-reducing fabric over the sand. Place a 6-inch depth of crushed stone on the fabric.

Aggregates form the major part of concrete and are derived from many types of rock. Granite and limestone are extracted from quarries, crushed and graded. In many parts of the UK, land-based or marine sand and gravel are available: these require some processing, such as washing and grading, before use in concrete.

The effect of gradation on the proper asphalt content is well illustrated by experi-ments conducted by Williams and Gregg (15) on paving mixtures made from a relatively soft crushed sandstone. Analysis was made on the basis of a gradation modulus defined as the sum of percentages passing the 1 in., 3/4 in., /2 in., /8 in., No. 4, No. 8, No. 16,

Certainly crushed rock has better interlock, and must have better shear friction for roughened surfaces. I do not have the data, but I would bet crushed rock is better in most or all performance measures.

This means that crushed concrete driveways and other projects are more vulnerable to moisture damage and the elements than new asphalt driveways.

In order to provide meaningful data to quantify the benefits of high-stability asphalt mixtures containing crushed aggregates, a comprehensive lab experiment was designed. The primary goals of this research were to evaluate the role of: 1) size and proportion of coarse aggregate; 2) fine aggregate shape; and 3) increased quantity of mineral filler.

The Concrete has been traditionally made with use of Natural / River sand as fine aggregate. As sand contributes to around 25 to 35% of total concrete along with coarse aggregates, cement & water, the properties of the fine aggregates would be one of the major influencing factor in determining the fresh & hardened Concrete.

1. Help Level the Ground. Starting the installation process with a layer of crushed stone helps level the ground and gives you an even surface to work on. Pouring concrete without a firm stone base will cause it to crack and erode over time. The stone layer also helps create a barrier between the slabs and the surrounding plant growth.

Retaining Walls. Layering crushed concrete is also a great way to create a retaining wall and control erosion on slopes or hills in your yard. Different sizes of crushed concrete can function together to help prevent erosion. A layer of smaller, more broken-up crushed concrete as a base will contribute to the stability of the wall.

Stone resin is made by taking shards of stone, binding them with a strong adhesive and molding them in with a special resin. The resulting mixture is then capped with acrylic or other coatings to ensure that the surface and core is protected and scratch resistant. And, because it is made from resin, the material is much lighter than normal.
