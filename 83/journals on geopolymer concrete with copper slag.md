Slag is used as both aggregate, and cementitious binder, forming an inorganic polymer concrete (also known as a "geopolymer"). The slag is atomized into a powder, and activated in the presence of an alkali, setting off an inorganic polymerization reaction. This material makes use of the inherent high-temperature industrial process of refining

## Utilization of alkali-activated copper slag as binder in concrete 
Abstract. This study was focused on developing concrete using alkali-activated copper slag (AACS) as a binder. The properties of alkali-activated copper slag concrete (AACSC) were compared with portland cement concrete (PCC). Different AACSC mixes were prepared with varying Na 2 O dosage (6% and 8% of the binder by weight) and curing methods.

## Effect of Alkali Activator on the Standard Consistency and  - Hindawi
Also, researchers have reported on ultra-high-performance concrete incorporating copper slag as fine aggregate, etc. Although geopolymer concrete is an extremely powerful alternative for sustainable material, the present application on buildings and other structural components is limited due to the lack of structural design and codes . Though

## Geopolymer Concrete - The Eco Friendly Alternate to Concrete - NBM&CW
The name geopolymer was given by "Joseph Davidovits" in 1978. Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is an eco friendly product which uses industrial waste by-products such as fly ash (waste from thermal power plants) and ground granulated Blast Furnace Slag (waste from Iron production) as complete replacement for cement in concrete.

cement. COPPER SLAG is a by-product of copper slag extraction by smelting. during smelting, impurities become slag which floats on the molten metal. Slag that is quenched in water produces angular granules which are disposed of as waste or utilized. copper slag is mainly used for surface blast-cleaning.
